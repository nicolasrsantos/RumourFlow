BREAKING: Treasury Secretary Mnuchin says Trump to propose `biggest tax cut' and `largest tax reform in US history'
Keep in mind that when President Trump announces this, every member of the left is now a tax and economic expert.

Is Trump's proposed tax cut actually the biggest in history as he claims?
Well, it depends on how you measure it. 

**As a raw number** it's *technically* the largest because the US economy is the largest it has ever been and there is no effort to adjust the number accordingly; but this raw number is meaningless without the context of inflation or the economy and so it doesn't tell us anything useful.

**As an inflation-adjusted raw number**, it's somewhere in the middle, but this number doesn't take account of the size of the economy and population now (very large) compared to its size during previous tax cuts (much smaller). This number is also misleading because you're not dividing the size of the cut by the number of people it's distributed amongst.

**As a percentage of GDP**—which is the true scientific measure—[it's not even close](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/26/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-his-tax-plan-biggest-cut-ever/) to being the biggest tax cut in history. In fact, the current GOP tax proposal to relieve 0.8% of GDP ranks all the way down with the Revenue Act of 1978; so far from being the largest in history, it's actually dwarfed by the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (2.89%).

In order for the current GOP tax proposal to be in the same league as Reagan's, it would have to cut $6.8 trillion over 10 years. That means reducing the size of government: fewer social programs, less research and a smaller military.
Thanks for the thoughtful and informative answer. 

Does it bother you that he seems to present policy measures in a deliberately misleading way? 
Of course not. Some day, people will figure this out. It's standard Trump hyperbole to make you think past the sale. You're not even thinking about whether there SHOULD be a tax cut, but if it's the "Biggest".


Because that's how you get things done. 
Can you be more descriptive?  Why is distracting the public from critical analysis of the bill better than discussing its merits and faults?  Is it better for the public to shove this bill through without critical debate? Is it ethical to defend it with just hyperbole?
I'm not asking you about the tax bill's merits, I'm asking if its better or ethical of him to argue in hyperbole instead of defending the policy itself?
It’s a benefit because it helps get the bill passed. By saying what he said, instead of everyone asking themselves if we should be cutting taxes or by how much, we are talking about if they will be the biggest, which is irrelevant and assumes the bill will be passed anyway. Some argue it’s unethical, but it’s definitely effective. 
Right? I'm very impressed.
Congress is incompetent. Their failure is not Trump's.

Rand Paul also said he would vote yes for the Tax cut, which is a very good early sign. This is coming from /r/PositiveTrumpNews

Him, Lee, Cruz and I never can remember the other individual but I know the name when I see it have become my indicators on how worried I should be about something. 
Why do I feel like my taxes are going to go up somehow after this.

Also they better not plan on deficit funding these cuts.
It is so infuriating to have the GOP never cut spending. I mean really cut spending, not future growth, but actual slashing the budget so we could start paying off the debt. 
Yup. At this point we are voting between tax cuts and debt or Keynesianesque debt. It's awful 
It's so frustrating too because it's so obvious that we have to reform entitlements, but whenever you talk about cutting spending, the left always talks about the military. You could literally cut the military's budget by 75%, and you still run a deficit with the amount of revenue we currently bring in.
Could they like not? I like just got into the middle class, very nice, would like to stay.
Fewer brackets that are each a higher percentage of income than previously and a top end bracket that is lower than it was previously.  So those just outside of the new standard deduction will see a lowering of taxes.  10% becomes 12% for the starting bracket, but that bracket starts at double the current income level with the new standard deduction, so this is a tax savings for the poor.

They are proposing to cut the 39% top end income tax bracket down to 35%.  A 4% tax savings for earners who make more than $400,000 (I doubt many in here have that kind of income...) and rumor is that tax bracket will be pushed higher, so the ultra wealthy will actually be taxed at 25% for a larger chunk of their lower level income, too.

The second income bracket previously was at 15%, now it's proposed to start at 25%.  While we don't know the proposed start range, we DO know there will be an absurdly smaller amount of tax revenue coming from the ultra wealthy, lower taxes for corporations, removal of the estate tax, and a small tax decrease on the working poor... so where do you imagine it will come from?

Also, while you might not have state income tax to deduct, you WOULD have higher property tax to compensate for that.  While you might not currently deduct it if you don't have a mortgage, many others in your state would be.

Edit: Also where do you get that they are lowering the tax rate?  Tax rates are expected to go UP in the middle class.  Unless there are some massive, and I mean absolutely massive, cuts coming to government programs, in particular military spending as it is the largest chunk of our overall government budget, that money has to come from somewhere.  Currently no such cuts are planned.  Taxes can't be cut across the board and expect to not run into a massive deficit. 
&gt; The 25% rate I heard will be after $150,000.00 for married and $75,000.00 for singles. That's what I heard.

Please, if you could, provide a source on this.  If this is true, tax revenue for the US government as a whole will be getting cut by more than half.  That's not sustainable by any means unless we cut just about every single social program, military, education and infrastructure program across the US.  Literally EVERYTHING would have to be cut by more than half their current size and funding.

This would lead to complete destabilization of the US as we know it.  Millions upon millions of government employees and any programs that are government funded to be out of jobs (figure every road maintenance crew would have labor cut to 1/3rd, as you can not reduce material costs, every police force, fire department etc cut by a similar amount, military neutered to absolutely nothing at all)... It's simply not possible for that to take place.
Trump To Propose Biggest Tax Cut EVER. Here Are 7 Things You Need To Know.
I'd recommend people reserve judgement until the exact details are released as there will definitely be negotiations in Congress before we see something official. In case anyone is curious, here are the new tax brackets with income thresholds as proposed by his campaign back in September, 2016:




Single Filer | Joint Filer | Rate
---|---|----
$0 – $37,500| $0 – $75,000 | 10%
$37,500 – $112,500| $75,000 – $225,000 | 25%
$112,500 +| $225,000 + | 35%
 

In Comparison to the current brackets:


Single Filer | Joint Filer | Head of Household Filer| Rate
---|---|----|----
 $0 – $9,325 |	$0 – $18,650 |	$0 – $13,350 | 10%
$9,325 – $37,950|	$18,650 – $75,900|	$13,350 – $50,800|	15%
$37,950 – $91,900	| $75,900 – $153,100|	$50,800 – $131,200| 25%
$91,900 – $191,650|	$153,100 – $233,350 |	$131,200 – $212,500	|28%
$191,650 – $416,700|$233,350 – $416,700|	$212,500 – $416,700	|33%
$416,700 – $418,400	|$416,700 – $470,700	|$416,700 – $444,500|	35%
$418,400 +	|$470,700 +	|$444,500 +	|39.6%

With the standard deduction for single/married-filing-separtely increasing from $6,300 to $12,600 and $12,700 to $24,000 for joint-filing, you should be able to get an estimate of whether you might see a tax decrease or increase. All personal itemized deductions besides charity/mtg interest will be removed as well. Personal exemption and pre-tax items would probably stay in place. 

Yeah looks like most people will receive a tax break (15% and below are the biggest tax brackets), people under $112k/yr stay about the same, people making $112-416k/yr will get hiked pretty high, and people above $416k/yr will receive a massive tax break.

Can't say I'm a huge fan. 
Marginal tax brackets.  You'll benefit from every change under what you make.
~150k-200k flat income. How isn't this a tax hike?
Let's say you make $250k/yr as a single person all wage income with standard + personal deduction.

Your current tax bill would be: $62,917

New system, Tax bill would be: $52,712.50

Tax break of ~$10k

Absolutely awesome tax cut. Would be the largest in several generations.

Losing the 28% tax bracket and moving the 10% bracket higher in effective rates results in tremendous savings. Everyone should actually calculate the numbers to see. The loss of the 28% bracket saves a ton.
You're doing it right.
Can you show your math? From what I can tell, currently someone making $90k pays about $16k in federal taxes. Under the new plan they'd pay about ~~~$8k.~~~ $12k.
Assuming literally zero investments, no 401k contributions, no benefit contributions, etc.

$90k - $12,6k - $4050 for individual dependent. 73.3k AGI new system.

Taxes paid $12,700

$90k - $6,3k - $4050 for individual dependent. 79.6k AGI old system

Taxes paid $15,600

So yes he saves a crapload on the new system nearly $3k

If he had deductions he saves even more.

That's the standard deduction.
Thank you for clarifying that. So my next question is why are people saying they won't see a major difference with this new tax system? An extra $6,000 is a decent chunk of change.
No, 401k contributions and all pretax contributions are preserved. It removes most ITEMIZED deductions for your standard deduction.
Standard deduction is $12,6k so no you wouldn't pay more.
That seems correct. I'd be paying 10% instead of 15% from income within $13,350 to $37,500 then the drop from the 28% bracket.
If this is true, it will change absolutely nothing for me. 
Yeah looks like most people will receive a tax break (15% and below are the biggest tax brackets), people under $112k/yr stay about the same, people making $112-416k/yr will get hiked pretty high, and people above $416k/yr will receive a massive tax break.

~150k-200k flat income. How isn't this a tax hike?
Am I doing this wrong? Here's my calculations.

On 250k/year single person all wage income with only the standard deduction, I calculate:

Old Tax: $62483.75  (6300 +4050 in deductions. 9325 * 10% + 28625 * 15% + 53950 * 25% + 99750 * 28% + 48000 * 33%)

New Tax: $64797.5 (12600 + 4050 in deductions. 37500 * 10% + 75000 * 25% + 120850 * 35%)

It makes sense to me because income between 112500 and 250000 is being taxed at 35% in the new system, while your income between 112500 and 250000 is being taxed at 28% for most of it, and then 33% for the rest in the old system.

The 28% tax bracket is the main tax bracket for middle class Americans earning between 100k and 200k. Now those same Americans are paying 35% on that money (offset by the 5% tax cut on the first 37.5k).

Basically from my calculations, what /u/777sir said is correct. Below 120k or so, it's a cut. 120k to 450k or so is a hike. ~450k+ is a cut.

Edit: Sorry for spamming - trying to figure this out.
You're doing it right.
Calculations please, I'm kinda dumb atm.
Typical for the middle class to get screwed over regardless of who's in office.
I get that. But 250k/yr is not middle class. The middle class rarely gets breaks, they (we) always have to foot the bill for the upper and lower class tax breaks. This system doesn't change anything for me, in fact I'm going to be losing deductions so I'll probably be paying more... 
Did you even try to math?
Suppose that sucks for high wage professionals like doctors, lawyers, etc.
Can you show your math? From what I can tell, currently someone making $90k pays about $16k in federal taxes. Under the new plan they'd pay about ~~~$8k.~~~ $12k.
&gt; You may not be familiar with how businesses remit and report taxes but it is done pretty much instantly by computers which calculate and remit it automatically.

Doing taxes automatically only happens if someone in the business spent the time to automate it all to begin with.

Many small business owners don't do this, because taxes are complicated. They just take all their financial information and dump it on an accountant at the end of the year and pay $100/hour for the accountant to handle everything and calculate the taxes.

Simplifying the tax code will save everyone money by reducing the cost of calculating taxes. It might be bad for accountants though.
Can you source your data? I remember it being 4 tax brackets. $0 to about $25K was taxed at 0%.
Thank you for clarifying that. So my next question is why are people saying they won't see a major difference with this new tax system? An extra $6,000 is a decent chunk of change.
I'd have to take a minute to do the math with the standard deduction, but it looks like a significant tax hike for me. Sucks.

Edit: removing all personal deductions. Does that include contributions to retirement accounts?
I will remain in the 25% bracket - but my deductions (sans the standard $6,300) exceeded $6,300.

Does that mean I will be paying 25% tax on the difference between my deduction and $6,300? Let's say I deducted $10,300. I will be paying $1,000 more a year now? That doesn't seem right.
My deductions were $15,532. I wasn't clear in my original comment with the "sans the standard $6,300" - and I rounded with the $10,300 example (for easy math, and was meant to be on top of the standard deduction).
Marginal taxes.

You benefit from the cheaper layers underneath you.
That seems correct. I'd be paying 10% instead of 15% from income within $13,350 to $37,500 then the drop from the 28% bracket.
Can someone explain this to a young conservative
Trump wants to remove tax deduction options, then reduce the overall rate.

Basically this means that total tax revenue will probably stay about the same, but it will be much simpler for individuals and businesses to calculate their taxes. This simplification is something that conservatives have talked about doing for many years. Even if incoming tax revenue stays the same, it will make the economy a little bit more prosperous because people won't have to waste so many man-hours (time = money, remember) on calculating their taxes.
Okay, now where are the corresponding spending cuts so we don't blow up the debt?
Are they the largest spending cuts ever, though?
But I think that was to cover an increase in military spend, no?  I thought I remember his budget being pretty cost-neutral.  
I'm cautiously optimistic about these cuts. 

To be honest, even if the effective tax rate didn't actually go down for anyone, I'd still be happy if this simplified how taxes work.
I think fundamentally, any real change in tax code has to involve more players to be successful.  I'm not convinced the current tax rates are the problem.  The problem is that roughly 48% of American households pay **nothing**.  Additionally, an alarming few (10%) of the top earners pay over 80% of all taxes paid.  That's the problem.

Redrawing these lines (the brackets) is meaningless until someone in Washington figures out that many hands make light work.  My dad had an 8th grade education and got a GED while he served in the US Navy.  Even HE understood that if half the people aren't working, then they're just a burden.

It's not about redrawing the lines.  It's about where the FIRST bracket starts!
This is the problem with increasing the standard deduction. It makes for more non-taxpayers for whom tax increases are someone else's problem.
Yes, I too am shocked at your inability to understand the new tax.
"So Donald Trump has unveiled his tax plan. It would, it turns out, lavish huge cuts on the wealthy while blowing up the deficit." -- Paul Krugman
Krugman always throws out the biggest jokes at the beginning. 

&gt; "This is in contrast to Jeb Bush’s plan, which would lavish huge cuts on the wealthy while blowing up the deficit, and Marco Rubio’s plan, which would lavish huge cuts on the wealthy while blowing up the deficit.
Unless they are talking about significantly overhauling one or more of Medicare, Social Security, or Defense, then it simply cannot be considered a serious proposal toward deficit reduction. We could cut everything else from the budget besides those three things and it wouldn't matter from a deficit standpoint.

The irony is that the Republicans are forever talking about the welfare state and entitlements -- I just named the three biggest entitlement programs in the federal government, and they are all completely off the table for Republicans it seems.
Medicare and Social Security could easily be much more sustainable with a payroll tax hike on top earners, and actually taking in immigrants since our "natives" don't want to have kids at a replacement rate.

Oh, and start making childcare affordable.
People need to realize that sustainability of social security and the federal debt/deficit are two different things.  There would be no talk about sustainability of social security if it was linked to the federal budget because then it'd always be sustainable until the government stops functioning.

Payroll taxes are not supposed to go toward fixing any federal debt.  They're supposed to go toward social security and medicare.  If social security needs more money, you should look at either increasing payroll taxes or cutting social security benefits, but social security isn't the one that creating that 17 trillion dollar debt.  If people want to argue that we should vastly cut social security and medicare and transfer those payroll taxes toward the deficit, they can do that, but I'd say that's a pretty terrible idea.

To be fair, I wouldn't say there's no link between social security and the federal budget, but the link is a lot smaller than people realize.  
Thing I don't get is that people keep talking about cutting SS but noone seems to talk that this would basically be a death sentence for hundreds of thousands of people who struggle just barely to get by.
Oh they have an answer for that, unbelievably it is that they think that churches and nonprofits will somehow step up and fill the gap to provide services to all those people who need it
The counter to that is that charitable giving is one of the first things people cut back on during hard economic times, and during hard economic times is when the most people need charity. There simply will not be enough charity supplied to meet demand in a private system, which is why the Feds administer things like SSI instead.

We tried the charity route in the past, then thousands of people starved to death in the 1930s during the depression, so we figured out that an alternative solution is needed.
Seriously, my home city Buffalo has gone through an amazing transformation the past couple of years because of government spending towards public works projects. Austerity would have devastating affects on the success of the city at this point.

Kansas is proof positive that tax cuts don't create economic growth. What they did was push Kansas to the brink of insolvency.  
Yes, and it should be pointed out that some of those very people are in Trumps cabinet. 

Mike Pompeo has been put in charge of the CIA, even though he has zero fucking experience in that roll. 

Krik Kobach is running Trump's bullshit anti-voter commitee. ( Remember the guy who got caught with an exposed memo talking about eliminating voting rights / installing massive voter ID laws, etc? That's this guy. )

Sam Brownback is being made an ambassador and being put in charge of some bullshit religious freedom their they're cooking up.

These are all major crooks! They will sell us all out and destroy everything we value in this nation if it makes them rich and powerful. 
&gt; Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom

I shit you not.

This appointment was a form of exile to get Brownback and the Kansas experiment mess out of road.
As a Kansan, fingers crossed.
As a guy who started at KU in '08 and lived in the state for almost 8 years, I've got mine crossed for you guys too.

I didn't pay a ton of attention at the time but it's strange to look back on. There wasn't any point in time where those tax cuts let to anything beneficial but everyone was totally fine with it.
way too many Kansans and other midwesterners will vote 'R' automatically and have for decades - it's a holdover mentality when voting 'D' meant supporting them damn hippies
But... the hippies were right!  About everything!

THE BUSH TAX CUTS.   The dementia is real. 
Shitty and shittier are both shitty.
If I'ma be standing in shit, I'd rather stand in ankle deep shit than neck level shit
The shit's far over our heads in both cases. Under 100 feet and under 1,000 feet of shit are both drowning in shit.
Watching Republican senators lie about the tax bill right now does evoke the same reaction as the astonishment and disgust of seeing a shit-breather. You nailed it.
As a temporarily slaveless slaveowner, I for one welcome the new regulations.  No one will own me!
I get tired of hearing about Trump's 'mental condition'... Self-delusion is *not* a fucking illness. Its a fucking choice. He's never had to own up to anything, take responsibility for anything or feel the repercussions for anything. What we're seeing isn't some old man suffering dementia, its an affluent old fuck who is, for the first time ever, being held accountable for his bullshit and he can't take it. For the first time in his life he's being called out for his bullshit and, like all bullies, he runs and hides to those will coddle him and defend him. 
But if the idea of a mental condition gains traction/proof it makes the 25th Amendment a possibility. Being ethically and morally empty is enough to get you the job, but not enough to lose it.
No one in his Cabinet is going to sign-off on the 25th Amendment. Why would Steve Mnuchin sign-off on ousting Trump? Why would Betsy DeVos? Why would Ben Carson? Why would Ryan Zinke? All of these people are disgusting in their own rights and would love nothing more than to ransack their own offices, why the hell would they sign their own death warrants on their jobs if they're exactly where they want to be? Why would they risk any of that? 

And who are you going to get to prove Trump's mental capacity? Who is going to force him to get evaluated? Congress? That's laughable. The 25th Amendment is a novel idea but it'll never happen. This administration know true allegiance to the US, they have no real sense of honor or duty to their country. All they know is that they have their place at the front of the all-you-can-eat buffet and they plan on taking their time and filling up their pockets before they leave. 
Even if they could some how get the votes from Pence and cabinet members all it takes is one letter from Trump and he is back in office. Then it is up to Congress to decide. And we know how that will go.
and get this, that 300.00 was taxable income. Basically they gave us an interest free loan of a couple hundy.


A negitive interest loan since you'd propably pay 75 of that back. But yeah that $225 sure was worth trashing the economy.
Didn't he let them expire?

[Oh wait, they did expire and then he reinstated the tax cuts only for people making less than $400,000 or couples making less than $450,000.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_tax_cuts)
See? That's not a tax cut, that's just squandering money on poor people.

Edit: /s to be on the safe side
Bushes whole comment about how he aquired political capital and intends to spend it (on tax cuts) is a pretty well known moment in presidential speeches. 
He'd already passed the tax cuts (2001 and 2003, if I remember right) before that quote.  He said that after reelection in 2004.  Then he spent it all trying to change Social Security to be investments and it went to shit (since that idea is moronic).  Bye, political capital.  
&gt; Then he spent it all trying to change Social Security to be investments

Shit that's right - good call.
Obama renewed the tax cuts for the middle class. He didn't actually cut them. Maintaining the status quo is not cutting. Nice try babe. He raised taxes on the wealthy through the increase of the capital gains tax and the expiration of the Bush tax cuts in 2012.

Still having fun.
&gt;  Maintaining the status quo is not cutting.

Uh huh.

&gt;  He raised taxes on the wealthy through the expiration of the Bush tax cuts in 2012.

You can't have it both ways.
Remember when we played fiscal chicken four times over the Bush tax cuts?  Don’t those days seem better now. 
Shitty and shittier are both shitty.
The shit's far over our heads in both cases. Under 100 feet and under 1,000 feet of shit are both drowning in shit.
Watching Republican senators lie about the tax bill right now does evoke the same reaction as the astonishment and disgust of seeing a shit-breather. You nailed it.
What really gets to me is that these assholes are acting like 2007-2009 didn't happen. They're acting like they had the economy under control and their bullshit had nothing to do with what happened then. Of course, it's always our fault. We're like fucking Cinderella except Prince Charming just served his term and we're left with the wicked stepmonsters.
I feel like this thread is a tribute to Jim Lahey.
If I have to be ankle-deep in shit I'm not going to be doing any headstands
They can't legally own people as their slaves so they're doing it through financial means. Debt slaves basically. There's shitty but now there's inhuman.
As a temporarily slaveless slaveowner, I for one welcome the new regulations.  No one will own me!
Or as many said about the most recent elections to justify not voting for Clinton:  The lesser of two evils is still evil.

Hell, I said it to myself.  I hate that I had to vote for her, but I know what the consequences of refusing to vote can be.  I went to Iraq because George Bush “won�? in 2000.  I joined the Marines back when I was *certain* that Gore would win.

I hate that our electoral system is this fucked up.  I hate the choices it’s forced me into.  I hate what it’s done to me and the country that I love, the people who live in it, and those on the other end of our extremely effective weapons systems.  

There are degrees of shitty and evil though, and I can’t think of another administration which approaches this one in both.  It’s like all the worst of Grant, Harding, Tyler, and Buchanan...except that they, along with Bush, were generally more incompetent and products of the times.  We look back on them now and see that their jingoism and racism and fervor for slavery (as well as their devotion to machine politics and kickbacks which were just normal at the time) make them all directly responsible for the Civil War and slavery and the brutalities perpetrated against the Native Americans...some moreso than others.

But Trump is something special.  He’s a racist out of time, an unapologetic pseudo-fascist who flirts with all of these notions which were invalidated at the cost of millions of lives *so long ago*.  There is *no good reason* for him not to know better.  As for Bush, one can argue that he was either too stupid, and controlled by evil men, or quite evil, but not too effective.  After all, the War in Iraq was never anything approaching a genocide, it was never a massacre.  It was ill-advised for certain, and it led directly to many of the problems we have been dealing with since:  CIA black sites and torture, extra-territorial-extra-judicial detention centers, a shoddy response to Katrina.

Trump takes all of these mistakes and declares them mistaken only in the sense that they didn’t go far enough.  He wants to put a guy in charge of the CIA who has declared that his biggest problem with Gitmo is that it’s too damned *humane*.

Don’t forget, even Nixon created the EPA.

On the other hand, I can’t think of one thing I have admired Trump for, one thing I have agreed with him over (which he hasn’t shortly revealed to be a devious lie) and I stopped forgiving him a long time ago.  He is not fumbling through figuring out how to run the country which he wishes to serve out of love.  He is just conning his way through every moment and working on the assumption that his supporters don’t care about reality, only about “triggering libs�? while the Congress doesn’t give a damn what he does as long as the heat’s off them.

There’s no excuse for any of this.

Plus it’s only been a year.  We haven’t even seen what the war he will start is going to look like...and I’d rather not.
Cut taxes and make the next generation pay for it. It’s simple really.
I get tired of hearing about Trump's 'mental condition'... Self-delusion is *not* a fucking illness. Its a fucking choice. He's never had to own up to anything, take responsibility for anything or feel the repercussions for anything. What we're seeing isn't some old man suffering dementia, its an affluent old fuck who is, for the first time ever, being held accountable for his bullshit and he can't take it. For the first time in his life he's being called out for his bullshit and, like all bullies, he runs and hides to those will coddle him and defend him. 
But if the idea of a mental condition gains traction/proof it makes the 25th Amendment a possibility. Being ethically and morally empty is enough to get you the job, but not enough to lose it.
No one in his Cabinet is going to sign-off on the 25th Amendment. Why would Steve Mnuchin sign-off on ousting Trump? Why would Betsy DeVos? Why would Ben Carson? Why would Ryan Zinke? All of these people are disgusting in their own rights and would love nothing more than to ransack their own offices, why the hell would they sign their own death warrants on their jobs if they're exactly where they want to be? Why would they risk any of that? 

And who are you going to get to prove Trump's mental capacity? Who is going to force him to get evaluated? Congress? That's laughable. The 25th Amendment is a novel idea but it'll never happen. This administration know true allegiance to the US, they have no real sense of honor or duty to their country. All they know is that they have their place at the front of the all-you-can-eat buffet and they plan on taking their time and filling up their pockets before they leave. 
Even if they could some how get the votes from Pence and cabinet members all it takes is one letter from Trump and he is back in office. Then it is up to Congress to decide. And we know how that will go.
Delusions can be part of a pathology. And we all know Trump truly believes in tons if verifiably false stuff.
Why not both?
It's not dementia or delusion. It's either unwilling ignorance or willful deceit.
A negitive interest loan since you'd propably pay 75 of that back. But yeah that $225 sure was worth trashing the economy.
Gaslighting your whole life has its consequences.
The Obama stimulus included the largest middle class tax cut in history.
He regularly makes claims that are the direct opposite of reality. The really amazing thing is that so many people believe his lies.
Didn't he let them expire?

[Oh wait, they did expire and then he reinstated the tax cuts only for people making less than $400,000 or couples making less than $450,000.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_tax_cuts)
See? That's not a tax cut, that's just squandering money on poor people.

Edit: /s to be on the safe side
Exactly, why does this even need to be fact checked? Who (that was over age ~18 at the time) doesn't remember this?

Although I wouldn't call it anything like dementia. Just a sociopath saying whatever he feels like.
Bushes whole comment about how he aquired political capital and intends to spend it (on tax cuts) is a pretty well known moment in presidential speeches. 
He'd already passed the tax cuts (2001 and 2003, if I remember right) before that quote.  He said that after reelection in 2004.  Then he spent it all trying to change Social Security to be investments and it went to shit (since that idea is moronic).  Bye, political capital.  
&gt; Then he spent it all trying to change Social Security to be investments

Shit that's right - good call.
Seriously, it was only 15 years ago. 

WTF is wrong with people. 
Remember how they all screamed it was a TAX INCREASE if Obama didn't make those cuts permanent? Now they're literally raising people's taxes at the bottom to give money to the top in blatant redistribution of wealth.
Yeah, I was in an office waiting for an appointment and watching that speech live. I thought I had a stroke or something when I heard that. 
Trump has an excuse of degradation of mental facilities, it is every one who believes this are dangerous. 
[He meant there were none by republicans since Regan excluding by those named Bush.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/02/16/trump-falsely-claims-biggest-electoral-win-since-reagan/98002648/)
Either he’s stupid, losing his memory, living in a constructed reality that does not agree with documented history...or his supporters are.

*OR* (and frankly most alarmingly) all of the above.
And all Republicans seem to have it.
&gt;dementia

No, it's just dishonesty
Bush is outspoken and against Trump. And a "failed republican" he doesnt want to acknowledge.
I don't understand how the GOP congress is okay with him making up shit constantly.  About extremely common knowledge too, everyone knows about the Bush tax cuts

What the fuck?
&gt;I don't understand how the GOP congress is okay with him making up shit constantly.

&gt;&gt;"It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it."

&gt;&gt;-Upton Sinclair, *I, Candidate for Governor: And How I Got Licked*

On top of that they constantly make shit up too, they're just better liars than Trump.
Evolution, climate change, and the normalcy of homosexuality are also common knowledge at this point, but that doesn't stop conservatives from ignoring reality.
All republicans lie. They're out there right now lying about the GOP tax scam that hikes taxes on the poor and middle class.  


The GOP congress makes shit up so they are fine with it. Trumps craziness makes them look more tame, they would be lying even if Trump wasn't there to do it for them. 
We assume that elected Republicans are different than the Republicans we know in real life. They aren't. They consume the same conservative media that has them roped into believing provable nonsense. They are brainwashed. 

*And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed—if all records told the same tale—then the lie passed into history and became truth. 'Who controls the past' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.' *
The R base build up their fantasy world with blanket forts and pillows, listening to delusional pappy while he spins his yarns. They want to believe.
Because they know the republican base is so stupid that they will gobble up anything.
They benefit personally 
Man I wonder if politifact is hiring. This lie doesnt even require a Google search to rebuke
Just have Ron Howard on loop saying "it's not", or "it didn't happen". 
With Trump, they don't even have to lift a finger. 
It's like Republicans forget the Bush Administration ever happened. They act like things went from Bill Clinton to Barack Obama with nothing in between. 
Hell, they think Hillary is president now.
His response during Hurricane Katrina and 9/11 was inexcusable, too.
Honestly, his response during them was pretty solid. Check out what he did in the Senate at that time.

He wasn't leading the charge, but he wasn't Trumping it up either.
I heard Obama placed the mine that sank the Maine himself.
Breitbart had an article about how Obama was the one that caused the dinosaurs to go extinct by letting a jihadist meteor strike the planet 
How convenient. 
Hell, they think Hillary is president now.
Yeah I remember Kayne saying that Obama doesn't care about black people and how he started the war in Iraq
Honestly, his response during them was pretty solid. Check out what he did in the Senate at that time.

He wasn't leading the charge, but he wasn't Trumping it up either.
I heard he let the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor.  He was getting fitted for a tan suit while the bombs fell and he did nothing.
Breitbart had an article about how Obama was the one that caused the dinosaurs to go extinct by letting a jihadist meteor strike the planet 
And a lot of them won't even admit to voting for him. What do you want to bet that in a few years time, most Republicans will be claiming they actually voted for Gary Johnson or something?
To be fair, everyone would like to forget the Bush Admin ever happened. 
This entire administration time traveled from the 80s to destroy the future.
And if the idiots of the country happened to saddle the country with a mentally infirm President, he couldn't spew his moronic bullshit via a public platform like Twitter. He was limited to making a fool of himself through the media.
It was a glorious age in which people could lead very successful lives without open access to the internet. 
And if the idiots of the country happened to saddle the country with a mentally infirm President, he couldn't spew his moronic bullshit via a public platform like Twitter. He was limited to making a fool of himself through the media.
Some of them are still serving. Grassley, McCain, Hatch, McConnell, Cochran and then Shelby who was a Democrat in the 80s but ended up with the Republicans after they won a majority in both houses. 
Reverse Kyle Reese?
We just need to steal Trump's sports almanac and burn it.
Hey, what about the OBAMA TAX CUTS??!??!??! that were part of the stimulus package? Seriously, wtf??????!?
Obama cut taxes ding dong. Child tax credit and education credits.
Bush Sr, Clinton, Bush, and Obama all had tax cuts at some point.
Why would he say that? That's just stupid.
Bingo.
Republicans all want to forget the Bush years. 


All Americans have to do is make sure the GOP never forgets the Trump years. Wherever that leaves America.

Oh who am I kidding, humanity has turned into 140-characters, 6 second attention span of a society. 
Jesus Christ, *Obama* cut taxes. 
Buh buh buh I thought that Trump, unlike most politicians, liked to get his facts straight before making a statement!
Politifact should add a new category to the left of Pants on Fire called Trump. 
Pants Full of Orange Poop.
Why do you lie about shit that can easily be disproven with two minutes on Google?
He's not talking to folks that use their brains. 
God damnit! That asshole gave his speech in my own backyard. I'm from St Charles, Missouri, although I'm at college right now. My hometown is going to be a battleground in 2018. Missouri has become Republican, but we still have a Democrat in the Senate. To get a majority in the Senate, we need to keep that seat. The demographics of Missouri are simple. The 2 main cities, St Louis and Kansas City, vote Democrat. The rural areas vote Republican. The key battlegrounds are the wealthy white suburbs that vote Republican. These are more moderate, college educated Republicans. Theoretically, they could shift Democrat, but they haven't in a while. It's no surprise Trump's giving a speech here. We need to do better, and protect the seat. Let's make this state blue.
It doesn't seem like he remembers anything about the early 2000's (including how he supported the war in Iraq before the invasion, FWIW).  It's like he swears Obama was president from 2000-2016.  Seriously.  I bet if asked directly he would swear to that (and his supporters would fucking believe it, too. UGH).  

Trump: "George W. Bush?  Who's that?"  WTF, man.
They were called the FUCKING BUSH TAX CUTS FOR CHRIST SAKES!!!
Donald Trump wrong ~~that no tax cuts passed since Reagan~~
It would be a shorter article if they started listing things Trump has been right about...
Does it count as being wrong when you're just senile?
Depends, how white and how rich are you?
Frank Reynolds level. No one even knows he was at Chappaquiddick
But, can you do [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deGXUfo827I)?
Yes.
Does it count as vehicular homicide if you're drunk?
Frank Reynolds level. No one even knows he was at Chappaquiddick
No it doesn't as long you're not driving.
But now the Regan worshipers think it's true.
It's like the biggest tax cut in history lie.
He literally can't stop himself from lying.
"The Bush Tax Cuts"
He's not wrong, he's a liar.
And the vast majority of his base will believe this to be absolute truth.
I specifically remember all of the hubbub surrounding the Bush tax cuts, why can’t he?
FFS, I can't wait til he claims to be the first president since Reagan. 
Trump lies about EVERYTHING.
This is getting really tiring. It should not be the case that I know more modern political history than the President of the United States.
Legitimate question for Trump supporters... are you ok with this?  Does it not bother you that Trump is lying to your face?  I mean, *you* know the Bush tax cuts happened, are you ok with Trump saying they didn't?
He's not *wrong* - he's lying. Enough of this bullshit.
Trump is literally just copying Reagan at this point. He's not even trying to leave a legacy behind.
He rarely says anything that is true. He lies all the time.
Do we really even need a Politifact for this? Is this man seriously this deranged? 
That is such a blatant falsehood that Trump *must* be delusional, not simply a liar but psychopathic.
Bush did  700 billion of that a few months before Obama took over...
To be fair, the 80s never ended for Trump. 
He loves the poorly educated.
It's amazing. His supporters will only start to realize and face this unbelievable stupidity when they start losing their jobs, paying more and more taxes and family members and friends start to die. Then again, maybe not.
The last tax cuts happened long before he hit the age at which Alzheimer's usually sets in, so he should remember them...
Errrr; the Bush tax cuts were made permanent during Obama admin, I seem to recall
Obama gave us the lowest taxation since WWII

It was so weird seeing republicans attacking Obama when he proposed lower taxes. Anyone remember when he suggested a $3000 tax credit for working parents? Republicans *hated* tax cuts then
Right it takes a functioning memory to recall the bush tax cuts all the way back in 2004. 

I'd say that if Trump dident notice paying less in taxes he really doesent need another tax cut he won't notice.

God I hate this twat. I am in a constant state of disbelief anymore. 
It doesn't matter to the population that still supports him. He said something, liberals are pissed, mission accomplished. They people that willfully ignore his blatant lies are the problem.
Revenue reduction does not mean tax cut. In fact, over the last two major tax cuts (Reagan in ‘86 and GWB in ‘03), tax revenue increased immediately after cuts. 
I know Trump was wrong here. But Politifact used all revenue reducing bills to prove their point, and these two major cuts increased revenue. 
I know Trump was wrong here. But Politifact used all revenue reducing bills to prove their point, and these two major cuts increased revenue. 
So you're saying deficits don't matter?  Reagan borrowed a metric shit ton, doubled deficits, and tripled the national debt to 41% of GDP, and Republicans didn't care.

Badass Bill Clinton modestly raised taxes on the rich.   He turned the deficit back to a surplus and lowered debt as a share of GDP back down to the forties.

The Bush tax cuts, wars, and housing market crises drove debt to GDP over 100%...and it has remained in the low 100s for 9 years.  And these tax cuts will create a YUGE deficit.  Munchkin is fucking crazy if he thinks GDP will go up that much.  That trickle-down stuff blows goats.   


SPENDING. Tax revenue increased after the Reagan and the GWB cuts. Deficits were because of increased spending. 
Read my lips, no new tax cuts.
Who listens to that and doesn’t know he’s lying? 
Could have just stopped at Donald Trump wrong.
He's thinking about the corporate tax rate which has not been cut since Reagan. Rather telling that his primary thought is corporations instead of people though. 
You had me at "Donald Trump wrong..."

Does he say this shit at events?  Can't someone there reporting just go **WRONG**
Bush Administration. Which one?  
Go look up "Read my lips, no new taxes" from George H W Bush.   A big R on that name. 
Whoops, sorry 'bout that. My mind did a 180 on taxes and the Bush Administrations.
Whoops, sorry 'bout that. My mind did a 180 on taxes and the Bush Administrations.
Donald Trump says he had the biggest tax cuts of any 2016 candidate. " the average tax cuts for the top 1 percent would be $275,000, or 17.5 percent of after-tax income, and for the top 0.1 percent, they would be $1.3 million, or nearly 19 percent. Middle-income households, meanwhile,
He's going to make America great again without any money? 
And the biggest would go to himself.

No need to justify why tax cuts are the answer, just offer them as outright bribes.  SOP for the GOP.
Proving once again that Donald Trump is a totem of everything wrong in America.

He could solve some small fraction of America's problems by just no longer *personally* causing them.
More trickle down economics - huge deficits...
Proving once again that Donald Trump is a totem of everything wrong in America.

Would still vote for clinton if she jacked taxes up to 70%.
Insanity. That attitude enriches the few who get favors from government and puts the little people into poverty. 

Partisanship doesn't make you better than the other side. 
Trump plan - Massive deficits.

Trickle down economics - failing for the last 30 years.
Crumbs for the little people  

&gt;Middle-income households, meanwhile, would get a cut of $2,700, or a 4.9 percent reduction. Those making the least would see a cut, too, but only of $128 or so, roughly 1 percent of after-tax income.
What they don't point out is that he's going to lower taxes to 0% for people making less than $25,000. So while it's not a large amount by dollars (the metric they focus on), it's literally the most he can do for people in that bracket. Whereas Hillary plans to raise taxes on those same people, albeit slightly.
Thanks!!
Typically lowering taxes has been a driver of economic growth, after the first world war, after the recessions of the 70s. The only time that high taxes were present during high growth was around the second world war and this was a result of a massive focused effort by the entire country as a result of conflict. 

What the US needs now is relatively low taxation, not for corporations and the wealthy only, but for everyone.

More taxation=more economic growth=higher tax base over time=more money for the budget.

Think of it like a lemon tree with lemons that aren't quite ready yet. You can leave the lemons to grow or you can pick them early and try to squeeze as much as you can from them. 

The idea of lowering taxation to boost growth is a fairly sensible one. Government spending, unless it's on big projects like bridges, roads, is usually inefficient and wastes money. Give the markets time to breathe and get some real growth going. 
Trump pledges biggest tax cuts ever as Senate paves way
God Emperor Trump: The approval process for the biggest Tax Cut &amp; Tax Reform package in the history of our country will soon begin. Move fast Congress!
If tax cuts happen, you will see a lot of uncertain voters go "holy shit, President Trump got me to keep more of my hard earned money", which then translates into not only more votes, but more confidence and a better 2018 
The only people that cheer for this are the losers that want Trump to fail at all costs. Normal people just want to keep more of their own money and don't give a shit if it's Trump that gives it to them
Lol downvote how about a report my dude smh jk

They try to dick you over because it's over a week period. If you work 10 hours one day and regular 8 the rest of the week you're still below 40 for the week with lunch considered. (no OT)
You're absolutely right. Not sure how to fix that other than converting your salary into hourly.
Exactly. Already, Mitch McConnell said tax reform most likely won't happen until next year. 
Ugh
That's what California will do no doubt. 
I get the cynicism but this is far too cynical. It would be wildly unpopular for state government to take money from the people and use it for themselves. Even liberals would be furious about this.
Hallelujah
Can only agree to that.

Plus: I think in the long run, this will leave quite an impact globally as well.
When other countries see what he does create, they will (hopefully) question their leaders a little more.




It's amazing to me that there some people who are STILL siding with Congress over POTUS. Congress snipes down an Obamacare repeal and there are people who cheer for this.

How the hell can you still be an uncertain voter
The only people that cheer for this are the losers that want Trump to fail at all costs. Normal people just want to keep more of their own money and don't give a shit if it's Trump that gives it to them
It's like the left took the movie 'fight club' a little too seriously. 
It was a repeal of like 6 of the 400 plus amendments. It would have actually been awful if it had passed. Ask me to elaborate before you downvote and I will gladly.
Lol downvote how about a report my dude smh jk
UpTrumped for the good humor ecks dee
I had a random shower thought the other day and was wondering what you guys might think of it. What if we got completely rid of taxes on all overtime work? It would definitely give me the incentive to work more overtime which could only be good for GDP. The rich aren't paid hourly so this would be effectively a tax cut only for the middle class, and only for that portion of the middle class who works hard to make this country run. The more overtime you work, the lower overall percentage of your earned wages ends up being taxed without taking anything out of the revenue stream for the government (they still get the same taxes from you that they would have had you not worked the overtime). Employers wouldn't be incentivized to fire people and just have people forced to work overtime since this only reduces the employee's tax burden, not the business'. With more people eager to work overtime at time and a half pay, this would incentivize businesses to hire more people which would create more jobs. All of this would be great for the economy and I've never heard any politician propose it.
&gt;What if we got completely rid of taxes
Take my upvote pede.
TAXATION IS THEFT!!!
Aaron Russo, is that you?
I avoid overtime for the most part because the tax burden is so great IMO it is rarely worth it.  If I could keep 100% it would be much more enticing.
can't hurt.
What's overtime?  Legally, it's over 40 hours in a workweek.

But, if you are considered to be salaried, then you are exempt from that rule.


They try to dick you over because it's over a week period. If you work 10 hours one day and regular 8 the rest of the week you're still below 40 for the week with lunch considered. (no OT)
60-80hrs/week salaried reporting over here.
Dude. I'm salaried at 58k. 

Lots of salaried people are as low as 40k. 

I'm not rich. 

My wife is salaried at 44k. 

Now we are well off where we live - but we still deserve a break. 

Just to put it into perspective that not ALL salaried people are RICH. 

I'd love to get a bigger break. Maybe we could afford to start a family then and out more to retirement so we could then start a business that we own with the extra money we save. Then we create jobs for fellow patriots. 
You're absolutely right. Not sure how to fix that other than converting your salary into hourly.
I have my own business and eat what I kill, as I have no salary. Nope!!  
Which is why they will fight not to give it to him.
Ugh
Two options: let Rs run on the tax success, or let Rs run on the fact that Ds blocked tax reform
Pretty sure my state will just raise taxes to make up the difference.
I get the cynicism but this is far too cynical. It would be wildly unpopular for state government to take money from the people and use it for themselves. Even liberals would be furious about this.
Hallelujah
CNN: "How tax cuts hurt women."

I hope this is why rino effort to make him look bad backfires
Think we have a bull market now?  If this passes, buckle up.
Yeah. This.

I work in a blue collar industry in a liberal state. Trump supporters are hard to find. If this happens, I think he will convert at least a few. 
because the President is not part of the establishment and will deliver on his promise to negotiate the best he can tax incentives for the middle class
Get rid of self-employment tax.  Encourage small business growth.  Screw the corporations!  Competition benefits the consumers.
I think self employment tax should at least be cut to 10%, so many small business are dying because of bad policy.
A competitive corporate tax rate, among other goodness.  Language pedes, we're going to need some translations for "They took our jerbs!"
DEY TOOKER JERBS!! 
They took our Jeb!s.

That would be brilliant. Tie themselves to Trump's success, let the GOP brand itself as a bunch of worthless twats, and then reap a grim harvest of votes.
Letting us down will be political suicide. Elections are coming up
So will this be accompanied with a bunch of cuts so we don't go even further into debt?  If so, then awesome...But I really don't want to see our debt continue to climb :/
Yes. Trump is already draining the swamp and reducing stupid regulations. Cutting funding for stuff that shouldn't be publicly funded. Also if taxes are lowered, spending will go up, which will further stimulate our economy.
I want lower taxes, less spending.   I say this as a federal employee myself.  
Spoiler Alert: It won't get through, cuz, reasons....
Everything I voted Trump for gets stalled out in Congress. I'm not surprised, I just hope we can vote out all RINOs and some Dems in 2018.

If he does this growth might double.  If he destroys bullshit regulations it might double again.

I'm not joking, real tax reform will make us competitive with the Chinese and other their world nations.

The key to wealth is American economics: infrastructure, smart regulations ( read: not burdensome), and low taxes.

The globalists are probably shitting their pantaloons.
Looking at you "undocumented democrats"!!!
Those replies. Do they think they sound smart? Or admirable, at all? Do they think that this is good PR for them?

They dont even have a reason to impeach. Muh russia? Muh nazis? What grounds are there to actually impeach on? Absolutely nothing. Even their own left wing leaders have walked back impeach talk because it only appeals to morons. 
Your telling me I can't impeach Trump because he hurt muh fefes and I think he's litterally Hitler?!?!? *REEEEE*!  [*AutisticLiberalScreechingIntensifies*](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ6Xh26kHiw)
this ought to be fuckin' funny - watching the Rinos scurry like the cockroaches they are - they'll be trying to do everything the can to submarine Trump's tax cut...."but, but, but how will we fund our free condoms for 14 year old inner city illegal Guatemalan high schoolers program!?!?!?!":
Lookup "The Fair Tax"....would eliminate the IRS and make people richer.  
Liberals: REEEEEEE I need income taxes because otherwise I'd selfishly horde everything because I don't have an ounce of charity in my body.
I am so proud of our president. We did good.
Ok... we also did good for the US by helping get him elected right?

Would be super cool to get this done before tax time.  
Songbird McCuck will come back to save the day by voting no
This was one of my top issues. People will be amazed how much more money they will have with his tax cuts. And that will guarantee re-election. This is the single best way to affect everyone's life for the better and in a way that everyone will be very much aware of.
Lol Trump literally has Democrats against tax cuts. Holy shit this timeline boys.
&gt; Republicans

Funny way of saying "undocumented democrats"
Politicians yes.. not voters
And here come the RINOs... out out out.
Does this mean amnesty for DACA people?
#BETTER BUST OUT THE SALT ON THESE SLUGS. 
Yeah, nothing will happen. Just more RINOs obstructing. 
Anyone got a link on the most up to date proposal?
Chances are Congress will fail as usual, but with the president placing every spotlight on the ball that is now on their side of the field, they'll have to choose between doing their job or political suicide.
Where I could see the proposal?

Tax cut without tax reform is really dangerous.
TAX CUTS FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS NOT THE UPPER CLASS MR PRESIDENT DON'T LISTEN TO RYAN AND THE SNAKES 
Has a draft been released yet? 
move fast, congress!

fly away, pigs!

freeze over, hell! 
If the alt-left wants to oppose GEOTUS on everything, maybe they can donate their tax savings to a worthy leftist charity (oxymoron, and they won't)
Wow checkout that "bishop" with no self control insulting the presidency. 
Glad to see him use political capital on this. He really wants these cuts and you can tell by his push for them. I hope they are huge cuts.
Meanwhile in Canada P.M. Trueshit calls all of us small business owners thieves and plans on decimating previous tax exemptions and "loop holes" put in place by previous administrations which were meant to incentivise small business. 
The Fair Tax would eliminate the income tax and the loop holes and carve outs for cronies. Congress would no longer be able to hide their corruption in the tax code! 
Curious, what could be the reasoning behind republicans for not going along with this?
we deduct a lot for student loans, though. I'm confused by that. 
the only thing congress can do fast is count sheep.
The tax plan will be more difficult to pass than his health care plan and we know how that worked out. He has a Republican-lead Congress and Senate and has squandered this opportunity. 
There is the debt ceiling to deal with, so he'll have to come up with money somewhere else to get this done. 
I would love a tax cut, but I don't see it happening. 
God those twatter comments are ridiculous. Nothing but hate for their very own president who has already done more than Obama could ever do. None of those leftist are Americans. They say the most anti-American shit and spew nothing but hate... But yet, we are the problem?...

"Americans" meaning "millionaires". Fuck you Trump.
Well, in his mind only rich people are actually people, so that's OK.
Trumps definition of "Americans" and yours may differ.
I’m sorry but he can’t lift sanctions he has yet to put into place. 
So lifting sanctions on Russian oligarchs?
I’m sorry but he can’t lift sanctions he has yet to put into place. 
I'm not sure, but I think he might be lying. 
Well, it's a real shame that all I get is a tax hike, you lying traitor.

And I'm rich.  Just not rich enough and in too blue a state.
I mean, I'm in the 1%.  Between me and my SO, our household combined salaries are over $400,000/yr.  Add on variable comp and we're well over half a mil.  We're still going to get fucked over to pay for Donald Trump Jr's estate tax repeal.
That's one percent. We're there also and the taxes will suck next year.

450k income, 120k taxes. That's a lot.
Is that 1%? Youd need to be making multiple millions per year Id think
That's one percent. We're there also and the taxes will suck next year.

450k income, 120k taxes. That's a lot.
Trump the grinch that stole Christmas.

...for himself.
The earliest the Moore election in Alabama could be certified is after Christmas so he will not get a chance to vote for the tax bill pre-Christmas. (That is IF he is elected)

So far there is not enough votes to pass this tax bill in the senate.
The first-turd has no idea what is in this bill.   
promises promises...  everybody can make promises.  and everybody does.

but can he do it in a song?

like....

me?

twelve russians running

eleven ladies shaming

ten plumbers plumbing

nine papers drumming

eight aids singing

seven ships sinking

six weeks lying

five brass rings

four collared birds

three jail cells

two eternities in hell......

"Anti-establishment" 
&gt; Spend MORE on military

As a Brit, this boggles me. You guys spend SO FUCKING MUCH on your military. Calm the fuck down guys. Even if you took away 2 - 5% of your annual spending, you'd STILL be paying more for your military than any other country in the world. 

You could put that money into healthcare, education, STEM, Welfare. Things that actually matter to the American public. 
FOUND THE COMMIE /s
Yeah, redistribution of wealth should flow the natural way: up, to the rich!

Anyone trying to bring it downwards is just a *communist* and therefore will be sent to hell by Supply Side Jesus
&gt;*"You were hungry and thirsty, so I eliminated funding for meals on wheels and food banks. You were a stranger, so I vilified you and demanded you be deported. You were naked, so I called you a filthy liberal who hates conservative family values. You were sick, so I repealed your only hope for healthcare. You were in prison, so I tortured you."* - Matthew 25: 31-46 in The Conservative Bible 


It's definitely a good idea to remind the US military spending by percent of GDP. It's quite lower than many expect. And if anything tell how huge the US GDP actually is.

Still, a small reduction could help unlock funds for ambitious programs. 
unless republicans is in charge, at best it'll be budget cut
Tons of funding in my department comes from DoD, DARPA, etc. I wonder if there are any stats on this.
They did just that for a long time. For about a decade, the Pentagon told Congress that they didn't need more money, that the current budget was already in excess of their needs, we don't need more tanks, etc. 
Then Congress for a variety of reasons increases budget, gives them the tanks they don't want, etc.

End result: DARPA gets to blow a ton of money on admittedly really cool shit
Would you still support Trump's proposed tax cuts if they significantly added to the deficit?
&gt;Well the stated intent today was that they will be revenue neutral when scored dynamically. 

Isn't this what the GOP has said about literally every tax proposal they have had in the last 20 years? The Romney/Ryan ticket said the exact thing about their tax plan even when independent economists said it would add significantly to the debt.

&gt; What does scored dynamically mean? Havent heard that one, only caught bits &amp; pieces of the press conference

Dynamic scoring is a method for analyzing fiscal policy in such a way that focuses on hypothetical actions taken by individuals in response to incentives created by those policies.  It's one of the primary justifications for supply-side economic tax policies- as supply-side supporters argue (as far as my limited understanding is), lower taxes for both corporations and individuals leads to higher and better economic activity.  The combination of people and corporations having more money to spend with them spending it potentially leads to job and wealth creation.  When people get richer, the government doesn't need to spend as much money on them.  

A dynamic scoring of tax cuts can argue that although these cuts may initially seem costly to the government, they will save money in the long run from their benefits.  On the other hand, a static scoring of tax cuts will just see them as less revenue for government expenditure.
Yep. I'm not a fan of the administration at all (check my history) but if it's actually successful in eliminating loopholes and sets the tax rate at 15%, and gets corporations to repatriate offshore funds (which we get 15% of) then I could actually see this as a tax increase.
However, all that was released today was a one page memo that was very light on details. What the details are and whether any of this comes to fruition is a different story. We'll see I guess?
There are lots of republicans in the house and Senate who say they would never vote for a tax increase even if it is only through the elimination of loopholes. Do you think they would be willing to do this?
It seems from my reading (e.g. http://www.npr.org/2017/04/26/525683530/4-questions-about-trumps-tax-plan) that the White House has claimed that the cuts will be revenue-neutral not because of closing loopholes but because they will stimulate growth. 

&gt; "We fundamentally believe we can get to 3 percent sustained economic growth," Mnuchin said Wednesday morning.

That's not a crazy number--average annual GDP growth in the 80s and 90s was over 3%, though back then population growth was also substantially higher (1-1.5%), meaning the total size of the economy also grew. 

With population growth at an all-time low and the baby boomers aging out of the workforce, many economists (most prominently Robert Gordon: http://www.nber.org/papers/w18315) predict the age of high rates of growth to be over. 

Perhaps more to this point, many analysts are skeptical that the current plan will be anywhere near revenue-neutral (e.g. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-26/white-house-unveils-trump-s-opening-bid-for-biggest-tax-cut). 

What gives you such confidence that this will be the case? 3% growth isn't crazy (though Trump's promised 4% is quite unlikely), but it's improbable, no? 
Do you believe in supply side economics? Looking at what happened to Kansas and Louisiana after corporate and income tax rates and it's pretty bad. Massive holes in revenue streams with no appreciable growth
Has anyone in the administration offered any details on which loop holes are going to be targeted and how much revenue they're going to bring in? "Close loop holes" seems to be a popular applause line on both sides of the aisle, but it also seems like it's only ever talked about vaguely. Maybe politicians do this because we all have different definitions of loop holes so everyone can imagine that the corporations who will be affected are the ones we think deserve to pay more. Presumably once the loop holes are specified, industry lobbyists will be out in full force trying to save them. Do you think Trump will be able to get support for specific loop holes and keep that support in the face of highly funded lobbyists?
But we cannot have it both ways, right?

If the loopholes are eliminated so that businesses are paying the same or more taxes despite a lower official taxrate, then you don't get the benefits of dynamic scoring/supply side.

Supply side only works if businesses actually save money, because ostensibly they put that money into investment which grows the economy in a manner that the size of the pie outpaces the smaller slice the government takes.  If they don't save any money on taxes, there is no supply side benefit.

I feel like Trump has to make one argument or the other.  Either it is a legit decreasing of taxes, in which case you make the supply side argument.  Or, it's merely a simplification of tax codes (not a bad thing at all) but there is no economic revenue growth.  In which case, he will have to reduce spending in order for his budget to be fiscally neutral.
&gt; I do not expect the growth to nearly offset things with only the growth, but it will help.

Why would you?  It's never happened before, ever.  The idea that "growth" will make up the difference is a fantasy.
&gt;What does scored dynamically mean?

It means they brought a fairy to mystically shit on the calculator. It's literal voodoo economics. Now you know what 'voodoo economics' was referred to. Didn't work then either.
&gt; If it were just a massive cut to the rate, I wouldn't necessarily support it.

I haven't had any time to really read about the cuts just yet but I did see on Reuters that they're supporting cutting "the U.S. tax rate on corporate and pass-through business profits to 15 percent from 35 percent or more"

Do you consider a 20% tax cut to be moderate, rather than "massive"?
&gt; Well the stated intent today was that they will be revenue neutral when scored dynamically.

you don't have an issue with this whole VooDoo numbers idea? They are saying "If you score it exactly how he tell you without doing your actual job it'll be revinue neutral". Its pretty obvious that they know it won't be and are trying to cover that up isn't it? 

There is a deficit problem and the deficit problem is glaringly obvious yet Trump, the GOP and to a lesser extent democrats refuse to address it. We can't have the biggest most bad ass military on the planet without paying for it. Do you believe Trump will address the DOD budget and bring to down to a level the also coincides with his tax cuts?
Of course we should cut education!  Stupid kids vote republican after all. Isn't it sad that's how low they have to stoop to get votes in the future?
Of course we can! We just cut everything dramatically, like education, infrastructure, you know, whatever you need. Then we can pay for a bigger military, right? 
Of course we should cut education!  Stupid kids vote republican after all. Isn't it sad that's how low they have to stoop to get votes in the future?
I support lowering taxes no matter the consequences. I'd rather see citizens with more money in their pockets and the government broke AF than vice versa. Maybe society will eventually realize that entitlements are a giant mistake and can be eliminated to reign in the deficit.
Do you have any sense of community that we should collectively build toward, or are you of the opinion that we are all islands who happen to live in the same arbitrarily drawn borders?
&gt; Can you cite a successful example of the real world application of your ideas?   

I'm not sure what you want me to show you, these are already real world applications of the ideas:  

* Toll roads are a real world example of privately funded, pay-as-you-use road infrastructure.   
* Private schools are a real world example of higher quality education.  
* The voucher system is implemented in some 20 OECD countries. It has repeatedly shown to provide higher quality education.  
* Hunting and fishing permits are a real world example of protecting the wilderness and public parks.
