It seems that now, in this year, and several years to come, we will be able to experience what I call a dictatorship.  We cannot smoke where we please.  We are too fat.  We cannot say what we think about Blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, or Homosexuals for fear of being called a bigot. Our Government already jailes innocent border agents for doing their jobs, and is willing to let Millions of lawbreakers stay in this Country.  When does it end?  Why can\u0027t we as law abiding, heterosexual Christians say what we want, drive what we want, leave a carbon footprint of our choosing?\n\nAs Cat4USA stated, Hitler was a very charismatic speaker.
