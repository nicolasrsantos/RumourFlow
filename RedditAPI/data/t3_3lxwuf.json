Probably one of the slowest developed countries on this issue. It also shows how difficult it is for a specific issue to get on the legislative agenda, since it only comes back so rarely.

A completely uninhibited Internet would be possible. What was probable and what major ISPs were pushing for was an idea to create \"fast lanes and slow lanes\"\n\nWe already have tiered speeds we pay for, but this would take it a step further. We would pay for speeds to certain sites. The obvious ones would be competitors like Netflix and Hulu. If that sounds too conspiracy theorist to you, I\u0027ll add that comcast already did it.\n\nThey tried to charge Netflix for bandwidth delivery to their customers, ie. \"We\u0027ll only let people stream at x/MbpS unless you pay us $_million.\" Which IMO is bullshit, because they are already charging ME for that speed.\n\nImagine paying for Internet, but only getting 5mb down and 1mb up on sites like Google and Hotmail. Trying to watch YouTube? Good luck, that\u0027s not included in your package. You\u0027ll have to pay an extra monthly fee for that. You can see where I\u0027m going with this. \n\nAnd this almost happened. The only reason it didn\u0027t is because millions of people flooded the FCC with complaints. ISPs also submitted a ton of fake emails in favor of it. And despite this, some bill will pop up every couple of years or more to try to do it again. \n\nSorry for the rant, ideally the best possible option is for it to be set up as free and open. A service provider can charge you for the speeds at which you use their service, but not what you have access to. There should also be clauses that address making sure competition is always possible (currently there are areas where there is no competition, and it may be illegal for another company to try to set up a goal service).\n\nI don\u0027t hate my current service through comcast. It\u0027s a decent speed, and the price isn\u0027t terrible. But I\u0027ve been places where there are no options, and boy do you get raked over the coals. \n\nIdeally I think it should have government regulations on the prices. Nothing too obstructive, but a basic cap with a scale. You cannot charge more than 60 bucks a month for 25 down/ 5 up. That sort of thing.

But informed brilliant people who can see the ends of various paths of society, and the almost unacceptable uncertainty of leaving up to the will of everyone working towards and against things.

I was by no means trying to make it sound simple. Just pointing out the near inevitability of the most powerful to try and shape the world, especially if they can do it unseen (to prevent blow back from any mis-steps). Both the general conspiracy nuts (the delusional idiots) and the extreme skeptics of their theories (the overly certain academics) have a tendency to view those theories as simpler than they are or should be, resulting in a nonstop cycle of proposing and dismissing ideas that are usually not even complete thoughts, let alone theories. You plan and work with others to make things happen, even if its just getting a free burrito or a larger bank account. The wider the scope of sight and the larger the ambitions, the more those people will try to manipulate the world.

UPS notices that Amazon\u0027s shipping department is sending out a lot more through UPS than it is getting delivered to it so they ask to be paid more by Amazon because of it. Amazon rightly says that\u0027s ridiculous because the butter already paid the shipping. So UPS keeps the same amount of trucks going to Amazon\u0027s shipping bays even though customers are buying more and more from Amazon resulting in shipping delays. UPS claims they\u0027re at capacity from Amazon and woe is them because it\u0027s expensive to add more shipping bays to receive the products from Amazon. Amazon says screw it and offers to pay for more bays on UPS\u0027 side so they can receive more from Amazon. UPS\u0027 response?\n\n\"That\u0027s not the point.\"\n\nAnd they reject the free infrastructure upgrade. UPS counters with an offer to store some of Amazon\u0027s products in their warehouse which will eliminate the need for trucks but will cost Amazon a monthly fee for storage because space ain\u0027t free. FedEx sees the mint that UPS can make from that and does the same thing. Amazon seeing that 85% of their deliveries are through UPS and FedEx has no choice but to give in and put some of their shit in warehouses not controlled by them.\n\nYou\u0027d be a little pissed at the shipping companies for pulling all of that BS just do they could double dip on shipping fees. You\u0027d switch to another shipping company but UPS is the only one that serves your area.

Big providers yes. But not small providers\n\nI can *sort of* see how this could be the case currently. Look at it this way: Big ISP\u0027s with lots of money throw their weight around, being shitty to lock out the little ISP. Government passes Net Neutraility rules, Big ISP says Fuck You and ignores them, and uses their giant wads of money to either ignore or buy their way out of the rules, leaving the little ISP having to follow the rules and not have access to the shitty techniques that everyone else in the industry uses to stay competitive. I had a family member who was worried about possible rules involving limiting Oversubscribing for networks. If rules had been implemented that limited that technique to a certain amount, my town\u0027s small ISP would have been screwed overnight, because a number of factors mean that Oversubscribing is the only way for the business to be viable in this area. It\u0027s not a bad ISP, it\u0027s actually a Co-op. But we would have been stuck with our states version of Comcast, data caps and all, had that come to pass.\n\nBasically, in cases where the rules only work if everyone follows them equally, small players get screwed.

There are three colleges, Harvard, Yale, and The University of California.  The list also has a couple investment and portfolio management firms as well as a sports and entertainment talent agency.  Investors relevant to the topic would be Time Warner and Google.\n\nI tend to think that a politicians beliefs are only as deep as the pockets of their investors.   The candidates want to win first and then, in a distant second is implementing a self realized political agenda.   Early on in these elections it would stand to reason that the amount of money a candidate is able to spend on advertising and traveling can significantly impacts the outcome, especially in the Primaries.  With that said I also feel that none of the larger campaign contributions are free, and that the tremendous financial support is given with a promise of future considerations.  I mean....yeah, obviously the money is given as a way to protect their interests in the future.  So in the case of Clinton, what do these law firms get out of supporting her?  I haven\u0027t looked at everyone else yet but I am willing to bet it is very similar.  [Campaign contributions are limited](  http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/citizens.shtml) to $2,700 a person so the money being donated is from the companies employees and PAC\u0027s that are set up.  Are some of these companies activley asking their employees for contributions?  What does Time Warner get out of supporting her?  I would think that, especially with Net Neutrality, Clinton\u0027s stance is contradictory to that of a big Cable Company.  Wouldn\u0027t Time Warner benefit from anything that makes Data hogs like Netflix pay more money?\n\nIf anyone out there has some insight into how big businesses go about raising funds and contributing to Presidential Campaigns I  would love to hear it.  This is the first campaign I have actually been emotionally invested in and I am finding myself becoming more and more disgusted with the process.  I just read about SuperPACs and I am not sure how or why the Supreme Court would pave the road for their creation.  \n\nSorry about that random tangent, but that\u0027s kinda what Reddit is about right?
