Give the masses the power to do anything but fuck themselves. Give them a voice. not the definitive voice, but enough of a voice to decide who gets the definite voice. The idea was a compromise. The government would usually be by the people, but always for the people. When the people didn\u0027t know what was in their own best interests, the people they elected would know better. When they had the right idea, the people they elected would carry out that idea. The problem is that we have career politicians, elected by uninformed voters, and who are in bed with special interests. Too often, we don\u0027t know what\u0027s in our best interest, and so we elect people, who either also don\u0027t know, of just straight up don\u0027t care.\n \nWhenever something goes wrong in a representative democracy, it\u0027s either because A) The government is doing what the people elected it to do, when the people didn\u0027t elect it to do the right things.

My friend who has had a crazy rare brain cancer since 19. She wore out her \"lifetime maximum\" and has had a hard time getting care, until now. She was lucky enough to have rich parents to afford some of the crazy bills, but she has had 9+ surgeries and can now get some insurance to cover her medications here in the USA. \n\n2. Another friend has a son with a rare epileptic condition he has had since 6 months old. Because of his \"pre-existing condition\" as a baby, he could not get on her husbands insurance (to say nothing of the lifetime maximum he also hit) So they tried to get on the state insurance plan. However, the husband made too much money so they couldn\u0027t qualify. This boy is so sweet and could not get care he needed. Once the health care bill passed, he was able to be added to the husbands insurance and get the care he needed. He has now been seizure free for over 1 year. \n\nReform to school loan money:\nI personally benefited because I went back to school during the recession (almost a college graduate!) and all my loans are thorugh the government, not a bank. So my interest is going to be lower and the terms better. \n\nCredit Card Reform: Good for everyone. Didn\u0027t go far enough, but the small amount able to pass has helped small businesses and consumers. \n\nI could go on, but I have work :) He has done amazing things, I am proud of him as a president and will vote for him again.
