We needed change and we were offered it in either Dennis Kucinich, Mike Gravel, or Ron Paul but instead all of these clowns got all warm and fuzzy over Barak Obama (because he was a great reader of a teleprompter and had more melonin).  He was going to be change, he was going to be different.  He was part of the chicago political machine, thats how he ended up in Congress and when he got there he didn\u0027t do anything to make us think that he was going to offer any real change...which was his main promise.  He offered us new faces and fresh ideas, Hillary Clinton? Joe Biden? Robert Gates? He is supposedly vetting every appointee with a fine tooth comb but they\u0027re stepping down for not paying their taxes.
