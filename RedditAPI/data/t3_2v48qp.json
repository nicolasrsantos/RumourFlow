Thus, the starting “pile driver” M1\u003d20*M2 (or M2\u003dM1/20).\n(d) Each individual floor was hanging in mid-air without any support below it. (e) Distance between each floor (to make the math easy) 9.8 meters. [Actual distance was probably 1/3 of that.]\n(f) The over-design factor in the static weight that any given level N can support is 2*Mass(110-N)\nD is distance (between floors) g is gravity [9.8 m/(s2] V0 is initial velocity (V0\u003d0) t is time\nD \u003d (1/2) * g * t2 + V0 * t 9.8 m \u003d (1/2) * [9.8 m/(s2] * t2\nSolve for t to find out how long it took M1 to free-fall the spacing of one floor into M2.\nt\u003d21/2\u003dsqrt(2)\u003d1.414 s\nDerivative of acceleration at a point in time is velocity:\nV1 \u003d a * t \u003d 9.8 * 1.414 \u003d 13.8 m/s\nThus, before hitting M2, M1 reached a velocity V1\u003d13.8 m/s. M2 is stationary, so its velocity is V2\u003d0. Thus momentum P before impact is:\nP \u003d M1 * V1 + M2 * V2 \u003d M1 * V1 (because V2\u003d0)\nConservation of momentum in this very ideal example of an inelastic collision (masses combine rather than bounce) says:\nP \u003d M1 * V1 \u003d (M1 + M2) * V3\nRe-arrange terms and plug in for V1, you get:\nV3 \u003d V1 * [M1/(M1 + M2] \u003d (13.8) * [M1/(M1 + M2]\nBecause M1 \u0026amp; M2 are greater than zero, the new velocity V3 of the combined mass has to be less than the initial velocity V1 which was equivalent to free-fall.\nIn this ideal world with floors of mass M2 just hanging in the air, we can further assume that the starting “pile driver” M1\u003d20*M2 (or M2\u003dM1/20) under the premise that one of the alleged airplane impacts was 20 floors from the top.\nV3 \u003d V1 * [M1/(M1 + (M1/20)] \u003d V1 * [1/1.05] \u003d V1 * (0.95)\nIn this ideal world example, we see quantitatively how the speed of the pile driver hitting a floor M2 hanging in mid-air slows down slightly from its previous free-fall velocity.\nHowever, M2 was not just hanging in mid-air. Using the assumed over-design factor of 2, the vertical support offered by the steel shell and the inner core at level M2\nForce(M2) \u003d [Over-Design Factor] * M1 \u003d 2 * M1\nIn order for floor M2 to fail, V1M1 has to also be greater than 2M1. In this example, it is. However, the momentum equation needs to be updated to account for the consumption of energy in smashing floor M2 and its supporting structures.\nP \u003d M1 * V1 \u003d (M1 + M2) * V3 + [2 * M1] V3 \u003d [M1 * V1) - (2 * M1]/[M1 + M2] \u003d [V1 - 2] * [M1/(M1 + M2] V3 \u003d [13.8) - 2] * [M1/(M1 + M2] \u003d (11.8) * [M1/(M1 + M2] V3 \u003d (11.8) * [M1/(M1 + (M1/20)] \u003d (11.8) * [1/1.05] V3 \u003d 11.23 m/s \u0026lt; 13.8 m/s \u003d V1\nThus we see after impact with the first M2 floor taking into consideration the supports under M2, that velocity of the pile driver M1 should be measurably less than the velocity of free-fall at that point.\nThe ejection of content laterally reduces the mass of M1 to M1′. Also the Force of material ejection must be accounted for in the momentum equation P in a manner similar to the over-design factor. More importantly, the force of content pulverization is another massive energy sink that also gets inserted into the momentum equation P in a manner similar to the over-design facto\nP \u003d M1 * V1 \u003d (M1 + M2) * V3 + Force(M2) + Force(ejection) + Force(pulverization) V3 \u003d [M1*V1) - Force(M2) - Force(ejection) - Force(Pulverization]/[M1\u0027+M2]\nIf the assumed static-load over-design factor is low and a higher factor is employed, the resulting V3 will be reduced further. Similarly, using more accurate floor spacing will factor in by reducing the available M1*V1 energy at impact with floor M2.\nThe official report is in the realm of absurdity, cartoon based fantasy.","duration":"","id":926,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_coeiofn","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":925,"links":[923],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Ellimist_","label":"But it explains everything!","duration":"","id":925,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_coefxi9","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":923,"links":[918],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"ians92","label":"this is an absurd and ridiculous reply.

[Actual distance was probably 1/3 of that.]\n(f) The over-design factor in the static weight that any given level N can support is 2*Mass(110-N)\nD is distance (between floors) g is gravity [9.8 m/(s2] V0 is initial velocity (V0\u003d0) t is time\nD \u003d (1/2) * g * t2 + V0 * t 9.8 m \u003d (1/2) * [9.8 m/(s2] * t2\nSolve for t to find out how long it took M1 to free-fall the spacing of one floor into M2.\nt\u003d21/2\u003dsqrt(2)\u003d1.414 s\nDerivative of acceleration at a point in time is velocity:\nV1 \u003d a * t \u003d 9.8 * 1.414 \u003d 13.8 m/s\nThus, before hitting M2, M1 reached a velocity V1\u003d13.8 m/s. M2 is stationary, so its velocity is V2\u003d0. Thus momentum P before impact is:\nP \u003d M1 * V1 + M2 * V2 \u003d M1 * V1 (because V2\u003d0)\nConservation of momentum in this very ideal example of an inelastic collision (masses combine rather than bounce) says:\nP \u003d M1 * V1 \u003d (M1 + M2) * V3\nRe-arrange terms and plug in for V1, you get:\nV3 \u003d V1 * [M1/(M1 + M2] \u003d (13.8) * [M1/(M1 + M2]\nBecause M1 \u0026amp; M2 are greater than zero, the new velocity V3 of the combined mass has to be less than the initial velocity V1 which was equivalent to free-fall.\nIn this ideal world with floors of mass M2 just hanging in the air, we can further assume that the starting “pile driver” M1\u003d20*M2 (or M2\u003dM1/20) under the premise that one of the alleged airplane impacts was 20 floors from the top.\nV3 \u003d V1 * [M1/(M1 + (M1/20)] \u003d V1 * [1/1.05] \u003d V1 * (0.95)\nIn this ideal world example, we see quantitatively how the speed of the pile driver hitting a floor M2 hanging in mid-air slows down slightly from its previous free-fall velocity.\nHowever, M2 was not just hanging in mid-air. Using the assumed over-design factor of 2, the vertical support offered by the steel shell and the inner core at level M2\nForce(M2) \u003d [Over-Design Factor] * M1 \u003d 2 * M1\nIn order for floor M2 to fail, V1M1 has to also be greater than 2M1. In this example, it is. However, the momentum equation needs to be updated to account for the consumption of energy in smashing floor M2 and its supporting structures.\nP \u003d M1 * V1 \u003d (M1 + M2) * V3 + [2 * M1] V3 \u003d [M1 * V1) - (2 * M1]/[M1 + M2] \u003d [V1 - 2] * [M1/(M1 + M2] V3 \u003d [13.8) - 2] * [M1/(M1 + M2] \u003d (11.8) * [M1/(M1 + M2] V3 \u003d (11.8) * [M1/(M1 + (M1/20)] \u003d (11.8) * [1/1.05] V3 \u003d 11.23 m/s \u0026lt; 13.8 m/s \u003d V1\nThus we see after impact with the first M2 floor taking into consideration the supports under M2, that velocity of the pile driver M1 should be measurably less than the velocity of free-fall at that point.\nThe ejection of content laterally reduces the mass of M1 to M1′. Also the Force of material ejection must be accounted for in the momentum equation P in a manner similar to the over-design factor. More importantly, the force of content pulverization is another massive energy sink that also gets inserted into the momentum equation P in a manner similar to the over-design facto\nP \u003d M1 * V1 \u003d (M1 + M2) * V3 + Force(M2) + Force(ejection) + Force(pulverization) V3 \u003d [M1*V1) - Force(M2) - Force(ejection) - Force(Pulverization]/[M1\u0027+M2]\nIf the assumed static-load over-design factor is low and a higher factor is employed, the resulting V3 will be reduced further. Similarly, using more accurate floor spacing will factor in by reducing the available M1*V1 energy at impact with floor M2.\nThe official report is in the realm of absurdity, cartoon based fantasy.","duration":"","id":926,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_coeiofn","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":925,"links":[923],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Ellimist_","label":"But it explains everything!","duration":"","id":925,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_coefxi9","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":923,"links":[918],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"ians92","label":"this is an absurd and ridiculous reply.

Let me help you out:\n\nWhat was the security like? Did you get searched?\n\n\u0026amp;gt;Very tight. Parking lot was packed with cops and Secret Service. Every student was searched before allowed entry. I remember that I wasn\u0027t because my backpack was a plastic seethrough so the inspector laughed it off and allowed me in\n\n---\n\nWhat did your teacher tell you when he had to leave?\n\n\u0026amp;gt;our teacher Mrs. Daniels was very brusque and upfront about it. The first thing I recall her saying was that America was being attacked and that people were dying. She had a way with words\n\n---\n\nAssuming your teachers had a better understanding of the magnitude of the events, what was their reaction like and what was the rest of that day like after the President left?\n\n\u0026amp;gt;They were quiet, my teacher Mrs. Daniels was speaking with some other teachers. We were pretty confused until we were shown on TV a live broadcast. The rest of the day was weird, I remember being slightly paranoid that the school was going to be targeted once I better grasped the situation. What better place to attack than a school with the President in it?\n\n\u0026amp;gt;\u0026amp;gt;Wait so your teacher showed you live videos of people jumping from the towers?\n\n\u0026amp;gt;\u0026amp;gt;1st grades then, my school had a no TV policy on 911\n\n\u0026amp;gt;\u0026amp;gt;\u0026amp;gt;The first image we saw was one of the towers consumed in fire and smoke. No matter how old I get, that shit sticks with you for life\n\n\u0026amp;gt;\u0026amp;gt;\u0026amp;gt;\u0026amp;gt;You guys didn\u0027t see the second get hit live, did you?\n\n\u0026amp;gt;\u0026amp;gt;\u0026amp;gt;\u0026amp;gt;\u0026amp;gt;I can\u0027t recall which one it was. But we saw live footage of a tower collapsing\n\n---\n\nWas he a good storyteller?\n\n\u0026amp;gt;Nothing phenomenal but I suppose it\u0027s easy to talk to 7 year olds. I liked his story about his dogs though\n\n\u0026amp;gt;\u0026amp;gt;Any chance you could repeat it here?\n\n\u0026amp;gt;\u0026amp;gt;\u0026amp;gt;from what I remember it was just a casual conversation about his poodles I think? All I can remember was that he had a black dog and a white dog\n\n---\n\nThanks for doing this! During the time he was there, did you have the sense that something was wrong? How serious did you think it was?\n\n\u0026amp;gt;I think we all had some intuition but it varied. I think at one point I thought he just had to urgently use the bathroom, maybe one of his aids farted next to him? That was my mindset for a second or two until I noticed his expression was a little too grave for that\n\n#Rest [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMAsummaries/comments/2v7jp7/iama_lazaro_dubrocq_one_of_the_kids_that_read_to/)","duration":"","id":1312,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cof4e6m","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"IamA Lazaro Dubrocq (One of the kids that read to George Bush on 9/11) AMA!","label":"brocq","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_2v48qp","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.423366226E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.423447292E9,"simScore":0.8439473215573824,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":1313,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"dickdude9000","label":"What was his reaction when he heard the news ?
