I\u0027m not here to preach or proselyte, I\u0027m here to debunk some of the misconceptions about Mormonism floating around in this thread. \n\nAll that aside, I would like to first point out that the name \u0027Mormon\u0027 isn\u0027t exactly correct; it\u0027s a nickname. The real name of my church is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I suspect the misnomer of \u0027Mormon\u0027 came as a slang term derived from our primary text, The Book of Mormon. Since it\u0027s kind of a mouthful to say, \"he/she\u0027s a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,\" I imagine people decided to call us Mormons because it\u0027s simple and is easy to associate that name with our beliefs. Whatever the reason, the name stuck. \n\nWith that misconception out of the way, it should be quite evident from seeing the real title of my church that us Mormons are, in fact, Christians. Our primary text, The Book of Mormon, is actually called The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. If you read The Book of Mormon, you should quickly realize that us Mormons are Christians. We believe in Jesus Christ, and we try to follow his example as best we can. \n\nUs Mormons are also not polygamists. It is true that we practiced polygamy in our history, but we ended that practice over a century ago. Mormon marriages are strictly monogamous. \n\nI apologize if this post is too unrelated to the OP, but I feel that some of these misconceptions need to be cleared up, in order to have a well-informed discussion about Romney\u0027s faith. \n\nIf you have any criticisms about me or my faith, I ask that you keep it civil. I am here for intelligent, civil discussion, not an ideological flamewar. \n\nEdit 1: Grammar corrections.","duration":"","id":63,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c6opcdd","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Why did people make such a big deal about the rumor of Obama being a Muslim, but those same people don\u0027t seem to care about the fact that Romney is a Morman?","label":"rweavere","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_11p4yh","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.350609142E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.350654755E9,"simScore":0.7798217109831441,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":64,"links":[63],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"fuckyouripod","label":"thanks for keeping your response brief.
