Many \"modern\" jobs require you to sit in an office, in front of a computer, non-stop. You contract says 8 hours a day, but effectively you maybe work 5-6 (with productivity declining sharply in the afternoon towards the end of your work day). I\u0027m also not opposed to the 4-day-week.  \n  \nMany people (some I know personally) also have to commute to work for 1-2 hours or more a day. That leaves them with little to no downtime in the evenings. Come home, prepare dinner (because of course both partners need to work nowadays), eat, talk a bit, watch an hour of TV, go to bed, rinse and repeat.  \n  \nA lot of folks just live for the weekend, that is to say Saturday, because that\u0027s the only day of the week, when you will be truly free from work. Guess how many people spend those rare days? Doing all the stuff around their houses, that need to be done, but can only be done in your spare time. So there goes your weekend. I don\u0027t know, it sounds very depressing to me.  \n  \nSince last year I work from home as a freelancer. While I do not have a fixed income and a \"secure\" job (although where I live many jobs are now only offered for a certain amount of years with mediocre pay), I earn on average more money than ever before, doing essentially the same stuff (even less complicated stuff, i.e. less management), I am more motivated, I can just not work if I\u0027m not feeling up to it and have no outstanding orders, and generally have about 300% more free time. I am overall a lot more happy than I ever was while working at an office.  \n  \nNot everyone gets that chance, but I feel like that office jobs need to be transformed. You can\u0027t expect someone to work 8 hours a day in front of a computer screen and be productive and happy at the same time. And most companies don\u0027t are if you\u0027re happy or not, as long as your performance is good.

If we think about a store that sells clothes for instance the cost of the product it firstly the actuall production cost. Usually an item costs about 3-3.5 times more in store than what that company paid for it from the factory (at least those are the rates in Norway, I assume it\u0027s similar in other countries as well). That mark up is supposed to cover costs of shipping, import taxes, vat, rental of stores, electricity, pay for everyone else in the company (designers, buyers, logistics, CSR, marketing etc), as well as cover the average store employee salary. In addition you want it to cost a bit extra because you never sell everything full price, so you have to account for discounts etc. And on top of that there are company taxes, insurances, IT costs, etc. \nSo, even if the store workers get a higher minimum wage that is only a small part of the total expense a company has when selling a product, and should therefore only raise the cost a small amount. Maybe a T-shirt that used to cost 5$ will now cost 5.90$ (which would be a pretty big markup considering all the other costs I just mentioned!), the worker who earns $15/h instead of $8/h will still be able to buy 2 t-shirts and have 3$ left instead of buying 1 and have 3£ left.\n\nThere are a lot of other places that a company can look at being cost efficient other than their workers with the lowest wages as well. Some main things they can do is make sure they have happy, efficient, non-exhausted workers who make the stores look nice, care about what they do and do a brilliant job making customers buy more! Other things are better marketing, getting better at buying/producing the right items, at the right quality, at the right cost, at the right time, so customers buy more and you sell more items full price instead of on sales and so forth.\n\nSaying raising the minimum wage will only cause items to cost even more so no one can afford them anyway seem like unjustified scare tacticts to me. \n","duration":"","id":84,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_csxaubl","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":73,"links":[3],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"ephemeregalia","label":"You seem to know your shit \u0026amp; I\u0027m young, uneducated, \u0026amp; new to the subject, but more employees doing less tends to end up meaning lots of part time employees \u0026amp; less full time, right?\n\nCould this be offset by Sanders(?) thing about increasing minimum wage to $15?

Generally you would want to keep the wages as they are and reduce the amount of work necessary to be put in.  \n  \nLike others have said, working 40 hours or more kills your productivity at some point. Depends on the job, of course, but office workers are probably only productive for 5-6 hours a day, tops. At least that\u0027s my experience.  \n  \nIf your hire an extra worker, who works 30 hours, you have 2 workers, working 60 hours a week, instead of 1 worker, working effectively 30 or less hours a week, because he is burned out, dissatisfied, depressed, etc. Diminishing returns. You start off strong in your day, but your performance diminishes ever more the more you work. So, let\u0027s say that 1st hour is 100% productivity (because I do not believe in more than 100%...you can put out what you can put out), 2nd hour is 100%, 3rd hour goes down to maybe 90%, 4th hour 75%, 5th hour 55%, 6th hour 47%, 7th hour 25%, 8th hour you\u0027re just wasting time to get home, but oh wait, there\u0027s a call, an urgent project that needs to be finished by tomorrow. That project would usually require 1 hour of extra work, but in your state you spend another 2-3 hours trying to finish it up. You go home, unhappy and burnt out.  \n  \nOf course you also have double the costs as a company, that\u0027s true, but in the end you just need to find out:  \n  \n- How can productivity be measured in my company  \n- How can I increase that productivity without making my employees work longer or harder  \n- How can I inspire loyalty in my employees and make them happy  \n  \nEmployees, who are loyal to their company, and happy working for them are more likely to put in extra hours and effort when the time truly requires it.  \n  \nIf we all just take a step back and don\u0027t require 24 hour services for everything and immediate deliveries, I think this could be achieved. Now, physical work is a bit different. It\u0027s easier to work longer hours if the work is diverse enough, but physical jobs also tend to wear your body out faster (though sitting 8 hours and more a day in front of a computer isn\u0027t healthy either) and you may have a lot more \"downtime\" in general. Someone smart can most likely find a way to make us work less, but actually more or at least just as much as we are now.","duration":"","id":86,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_csx8e1e","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":73,"links":[3],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"ephemeregalia","label":"You seem to know your shit \u0026amp; I\u0027m young, uneducated, \u0026amp; new to the subject, but more employees doing less tends to end up meaning lots of part time employees \u0026amp; less full time, right?\n\nCould this be offset by Sanders(?) thing about increasing minimum wage to $15?

They surely have the best free-time/work ratio in the world; meaning that every Dane has enough time to go to work and has enough time for family, friends and hobbies. When I studied there, I was surpised how dedicated all the students were, working a lot, always doing there assignments and shit, it was really weird, but they seemed fine and not under stress. And then, starting Friday at 4pm, they would get absolutely hammered and party all night.\n\n\nAlso, whatever you do - As long as it is honest work, it is accepted and not looked down upon. Bus driver, grocery store, gas station, railway worker, architect or professor, they don\u0027t really are. Where in Germany (where I come from), your average supermarket cashier \nperson doesn\u0027t even know German, theirs all know perfect English. \n\nAlso, the hierarchical top-down relationship is latently present, but the boss-employee relationship is a lot more horizontal.\n\n\nBasically, the Danes’ Protestant work ethic is tempered by their understanding that working too hard–or too long–is a waste of time.

If you join the workforce specifically at 22, work full time, perhaps do a masters by 30, still working.

Then by 40 you have a car and a spouse and a kid or 1.5-3, depending on how much you have managed to save, perhaps even bought a house....  Now you are 40 you can start to save, and you are considered \"in your career\" and are making the money you should expect the next 25, in fact, most people at this point on this trajectory expect to make much more.\n\nThis is the American Dream, and it works for many... but for many many more this can\u0027t be achieved.

He probably wouldn\u0027t be looking for 80-90 hours per week from me, but I\u0027d have to be available to do jobs he was working on during those hours with random bits of time off here and there, and I knew I didn\u0027t want to deal with that while crawling around attics fishing wires for old work jobs.\n\nSo honestly I don\u0027t know why you think being an electrician means you can do as little work as possible, because it seems like at the start when you need your work hours, classroom hours and then passing tests for certification, so it\u0027s a lot of work.

Also common is not actually working for the company you\u0027re working for. Have a friend who works at Microsoft. Not *for* Microsoft, but *at* Microsoft. He gets none of the stock options, company gym, countless benefits, etc. He can\u0027t even ride the company bus. Yes, they have their own regional transit system. No, he can\u0027t ride it.\n\n\u0026gt; Sorry but this sounds like massiv exploitation of employees.\n\nIt is.\n\n\u0026gt; Do you at least get benefits like medical care if you work minimum wage?\n\nI had to look this up. If you work over 35 hours they have to *offer* health care, whether or not you can afford it. If you\u0027re at minimum wage, you almost surely qualify for free or subsidized insurance through the government.\n\nWhat these companies have done though is cut everyone\u0027s hours to less than 35. So you\u0027re not only making minimum wage ($7.25 is the federal minimum, many states are higher, but the highest is $9.60 in Rhode Island,) but you\u0027re not even getting 40 hours.\n\nEven better, the republicans tried to advance a bill saying they don\u0027t have to pay benefits unless they hit a full 40 hours. Meaning if they schedule you to leave 15-minutes early each Friday, you\u0027d get no benefits. This didn\u0027t happen, but they tried.\n\nThese problems make our division between the very rich and the rest wider and wider. CEO pay, corporate profits and the stock market are each at all-time highs.\n\nAnd remember, in America, we don\u0027t get vacations the way other developed nations do. Most career jobs offer 1-week paid. Virtually no minimum wage jobs offer any vacation time. Even the rare job that offers 2 weeks or more doesn\u0027t actually let us take it.\n\nI\u0027m in my 40s and I\u0027ve had ONE paid week of vacation in my entire working life, and I wasn\u0027t even allowed to take it all at once. They made me break it up so they wouldn\u0027t be short staffed. So that\u0027s five paid business days off ever, but not in a row.\n\nI worked at a bank where I was *required* to take 7 straight days off each year, but I was on commission and there was nobody to watch my sales when I left, so the following month my income always took a big hit.","duration":"","id":242,"color":"black","redditID":"t1_csx9ceh","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":241,"links":[240],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"julomat","label":"Thank you for your answer. \n\nIs this common?

I was doing some banquet bartending on the weekends for a hotel.  It was pretty focused on large ballroom receptions, lot of corporate stuff.  We could fit 1k in one ballroom, and had several more small ones.\n\nWe got this new manager one day.  I didn\u0027t work that much, as i was working anther job, this was fun on the weekends because of its diversity in conventions.  I liked bartending with something going on in the background, wasn\u0027t always interesting, but always something new.  So i come in and there are these 4 girls, young (18-22 i think) and each of them has on different shoes and a very near our uniform outfit.  I say \u0027near\u0027 because 2 were wearing heels, and one had on a miniskirt.  These four gals looked lost, and i was informed that they were interns.  They were unpaid, and working for a local school that *taught people how to wait tables and got them temp jobs for free as internships, and the students were paying for this \"education\".*  \n\nI couldn\u0027t believe it.  They were complete idiots.  Furthermore, i couldn\u0027t ask them to do anything, even bussing tables they were inept because they couldn\u0027t carry the trays, or even pick up plates quickly.  They were completely unsuited for the work.  I sent them home and we just muscled through the work.\n\nI realized later, looking at the schedule, that the manager had posted these gals on the schedule, all 4 of them, as regular employees with regular shifts *instead of our normal shift workers*.  In other words, the hotel, which had large banquets had planned to suborn their staff with interns who were to actually come in and work for free, and they thought this was going to work.  \n\nI warned the manager, and others including the Vice Executive Chef who worked nights, that this wasn\u0027t exactly illegal (although interns should not be unsupervised in this way, nor do things untrained) it was certainly unethical.\n\nNo one listened.  They kept the schedule the same, and after that week we never had another intern from that \"school\" come in for anything.  It was the first time i had ever been exposed to the stupidity that comes from the blind leading the blind, so blatantly obvious.  \n\nAt every other job i\u0027ve had, we paid our interns, and gave them much lighter workloads.

I do get some awareness, but the only times I actually get influenced by any sort of publicity is opportunistic and direct and unlikely to go towards whatever is actually advertised. So if I see an ad for donuts or whatever and I\u0027m hungry, I may just go get something to eat because my brain was influenced. But I am very unlikely to direct my attention to the actual product I saw, rather any convenient alternative. I don\u0027t actually go out of my way to avoid being influenced on purpose, I simply forget about what I saw too quickly. My mind just filters it out on its own, it\u0027s not a conscious effort. It also filters out a lot of actually useful information so I\u0027m not entirely sure it\u0027s beneficial overall.\n\nIt\u0027s just too transparent most of the times. The creative aspect can sometimes be interesting, but I know someone that\u0027s entirely on purpose and I just can\u0027t take it seriously. Even when it does manage to convey something emotionally, I remain too aware that it\u0027s really just all there to sell something. I do want to be informed of products, services and such that could be useful to me. I just know I won\u0027t get useful information from advertising, as it\u0027s not its purpose. Most advertising nowadays seems to focus at least partially on status, selling a lifestyle, an image of who you want to be, or similar priorities that just do not resonate with me.\n\nI literally look away most of the time; I usually prefer to let my mind drift away. I remember a few years back I saw a woman reading a magazine on the train and was really taken aback at the fact that she actually looked and paid attention to the ad pages, which make up 50-70% (sometimes it seems way more) of most magazines and newspapers. I had no idea anyone actually did that. The concept was just totally foreign to me and still is. I get too annoyed when reading newspapers for example because of this. I know it\u0027s necessary and how they exist in the first place, but it\u0027s just all so much noise.

That money will leave the US, and can no longer be TAXED, which is your whole goal here, and the millennials will have far less than they did. Problem 2, those millennials will end up leaving, creating a vicious cycle of get to the top, then leave.\n\nSo you\u0027re saying America will never again have anything to offer (i.e. export) if the rich leave? Now I hope they really leave, so you\u0027ll realize how wrong you are. Millennials aren\u0027t leaving anytime soon - a lot of them are immigrants!

Furthermore, we see that the best businesses are the ones that dominate the field, therefore, throwing the best ones aside for less effective ones.\n\nThat made no sense. Besides, protectionist laws could be passed after they leave. Money could be printed to boost the national economy again - in the process devaluing foreign Microsoft/Apple\u0027s old dusty dollars.\n\nAs a country, it\u0027s easy to fight traitors who leave to save a buck. Even easier than fighting them at home mixed with all the good, hard working people! I personally can\u0027t wait for big corporations to TRY that move! There would be widespread campaigns against their products. Their citizenship would be revoked, and they\u0027d be begging for this country to take them and their money back. It would be so fun to watch, popcorn shares would skyrocket :)\n\n\u0026gt; And trickle down did work during the Reagan era and before.\n\nReagan was a hired compulsive liar and corporate shill.

That means that 16-18 hours of your day would already be spent.  That would leave only 6-8 hours for everything else, including household chores and tasks, grocery shopping, cooking, transport/commuting, hygiene, \n\nLet\u0027s say you wake up at 6.  You spend 20 minutes in the shower (because, like me, you have a lot of hair and it takes a while to wash that shit), 10 minutes to get dressed, 30 minutes cooking breakfast and eating.  If you have family, especially children, basically double it.  It is now 7.  You have a 35 minute commute, only it takes closer to an hour because of traffic.  You get to work 5 minutes late because of said traffic, are berated for it by your boss, already off to a shitty day.  The 10 hour work day begins at 8, ends at 6.  You leave work, exhausted, pick up your kid(s) from whoever has them (since their school probably got out at 3), but then you remember that you have to go grocery shopping or else there won\u0027t be anything to eat at home.  Due to that 1 hr commute and the stops along the way, you don\u0027t get home until 7:30.  Hopefully your kids have already finished their homework, because by now they (and you) are too tired to accomplish Jack shit.

How could you possibly complain about that?","duration":"","id":689,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_csxz4m6","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":688,"links":[687],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Proserpina","label":"Nnnnoooooooo, actually that\u0027s completely false.\n\nLet\u0027s assume that people need 6-8 hours of sleep a day.  50 hrs of work a week would mean 10 hours for 5 days.  That means that 16-18 hours of your day would already be spent.  That would leave only 6-8 hours for everything else, including household chores and tasks, grocery shopping, cooking, transport/commuting, hygiene, \n\nLet\u0027s say you wake up at 6.  You spend 20 minutes in the shower (because, like me, you have a lot of hair and it takes a while to wash that shit), 10 minutes to get dressed, 30 minutes cooking breakfast and eating.  If you have family, especially children, basically double it.  It is now 7.  You have a 35 minute commute, only it takes closer to an hour because of traffic.  You get to work 5 minutes late because of said traffic, are berated for it by your boss, already off to a shitty day.  The 10 hour work day begins at 8, ends at 6.  You leave work, exhausted, pick up your kid(s) from whoever has them (since their school probably got out at 3), but then you remember that you have to go grocery shopping or else there won\u0027t be anything to eat at home.  Due to that 1 hr commute and the stops along the way, you don\u0027t get home until 7:30.  Hopefully your kids have already finished their homework, because by now they (and you) are too tired to accomplish Jack shit.  You make and eat dinner, the kids laze about being kids while you clean up, do the dishes, call your Aunt Sal because it\u0027s her birthday or some fuckin thing, answer work emails (if you\u0027re lucky enough to have a decent paying office job), make sure the kids have brushed their teeth and put them to bed, which is a whole separate ordeal unto itself.  It is now 9pm.\n\nYou now have one hour before you need to be in bed to get that full 8 hours of sleep you need to function.\n\n*One hour.*\n\nYour assumption that a 50 hour work week is only 30% of your time, leaving 70% free, is ridiculous to the extreme, and completely ignores the reality of modern family life, especially on a small income (not to mention ignoring the need to sleep).  And this is on the off chance that your family has health insurance, that none of them are sick or disabled, that none of your kids are struggling in school and need extra help, that your house is fully furnished and not in desperate need of repair, that you have access to a washer and dryer, and that you only need to work the one job.","duration":"","id":688,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_csxymv7","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":687,"links":[483],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"sixblackgeese","label":"But how many hours of work do you think a person ought to put in? 50 hours is only 30% of your time.

He bought these piece of shit cars, most rotted out, and wanted to resell them. He paid way too much for them and just was so delusional. On top of that the titles were in his name, so he had to be there when we sold them, except he wouldnt be there. Would tell him he needs to be at the shop tomorrow at X time to transfer the title. Nope, would leave an hour before and not answer his phone later. So I just started scrapping cars. I didnt give a fuck anymore. I had a buyer lined up for a jeep that was gutted and rotted out, but some guy wanted it for the drivetrain and idk what else. He was paying $1k. Boss didnt show up to transfer the title and I had to tell the buyer that I was sorry but I couldnt sell it since my boss was a fuck. So I told the mechanic to load it up on our trailer and haul it to the scrap yard. Scrap yard gave us $300 for it and some other scrap we threw in it.\n\nBoss was pissed, but I told him that selling cars was no longer my job and that any rusty piece of shit anything around the shop was going to get scrapped.\n\n/rant jesus that job was frustrating.","duration":"","id":835,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_csxdgdu","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":834,"links":[806],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Phyltre","label":"That\u0027s literally a line that gets you fired where I work.","duration":"","id":834,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_csxb1bu","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":806,"links":[805],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"NicolasCarnot","label":"Can I join?

Work isn\u0027t the time you are at X company doing the job.\n\nIt\u0027s the 60 minutes of commute. The 45 minutes of unpaid lunch. The 15 minutes of unpaid clocking in/out. The 60 minutes of getting ready.  You may work 8 hours a day, but you\u0027re investing 11 hours, at least, into the job. \n\nThen you can account for the fact that at work, you are now stuck paying for lunch. You may be working 8 hours, but you\u0027re only being paid for 7 because you have to buy food you otherwise would never get.\n\nYou might be thinking \"why not just cook at home and bring lunch in?\" but a lot of people don\u0027t work a shift that allows for that. You come home at 10pm, you can\u0027t really cook unless you want to spend what precious free time you have *working more*. To add insult to injury, now you\u0027re buying more food you wouldn\u0027t otherwise buy to eat dinner.\n\nThen there is something I call scattering.\n\nMany companies base schedules off of profit margin and nothing else. If that means scheduling you to work 2pm-9pm, then 8am-1pm the next day, and then you get one day off, and then you work 8am-10pm, well, they\u0027ll do it. The result is you never get to unwind and decompress.\n\nOur brains don\u0027t just switch gears instantly. They reflect on the day, and its happenings. If we had a stressful day at work, we can\u0027t come home and forget everything. \n\nWe end up devoting our free time to just THINKING of work. Now  with two days off in a row, or with a regular schedule, our brain allows us to decompress a bit. Day 1 we\u0027re still in work mode, but by day 2 we are in relaxation mode, allowing us to come into work on day 3 ready to give 150% again.\n\nBut with a scattered schedule, you end up pretty much devoting 24/7 to the job. Literally every waking second. Because your next shift is always around the corner, waiting to fuck you raw.","duration":"","id":873,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_csyd7kx","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":762,"links":[761],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"darehmeyod","label":"Same here.

Economic activity is what drives profit for the country.  Economic activity is not beholden to manufacturing, products/services is what drives an economy.

When society ceases to believe EVERY life has value, then the prevailing assumptions the society functions upon will change.\n\nEvery American are not \"entitled\" to anything, whether its a certain living standard, or a \"if you follow an implied set of rules, you will always do well enough\".  You have merely have accidentally been born and raised in a time period when the American nation **had** economic wealth.\n\nGlobalization is not a fact of life.  Its a set of legal conditions imposed upon by the 1% of the United States, so THEIR notion of entitlement is met.  That does not mean one can ban globalization policies to favor national protectionism, and not suffer economic consequences.  It also doesn\u0027t mean the ruling class in this country cannot lie to you about what is necessary, and claim its in the name of \"globalization\".

The only thing I see that will improve American lives is if all its citizens develop better critical thinking skills, lose this sense of \"entitlement\", and don\u0027t acquiesce to being raped in the ass by what the 1% thinks is \"fair\".

You end up perpetually irritated and tired, and you will want to use some the 3 hours you have to get more sleep, making the window to socialize and run errands even smaller.\n\nEdit: math is hard","duration":"","id":1169,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_csx6lp1","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1168,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"farthumm","label":"Screw you Jeb Bush, as a man who worked his tail off to get out of my 12 hour a day production floor factory job that paid a measly $9/HR I feel 100% justified in saying you are out of touch with problems faced by the common man.","duration":"","id":1168,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cswulug","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Jeb Bush: People Need to Work Longer Hours","label":"another-chance","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_3clwu9","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.436424644E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.436430466E9,"simScore":0.6385772702293564,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.436454944E9,"simScore":0.7485923217557644,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.436454944E9,"simScore":0.6598407827231842,"sentiment":"  Positive"},{"index":1194,"links":[1168],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"milapoonis","label":"currently doing that and I have about $7k saved up and I\u0027m 22, what do I do to get out?","duration":"","id":1194,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_csx6i57","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1168,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"farthumm","label":"Screw you Jeb Bush, as a man who worked his tail off to get out of my 12 hour a day production floor factory job that paid a measly $9/HR I feel 100% justified in saying you are out of touch with problems faced by the common man.","duration":"","id":1168,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cswulug","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Jeb Bush: People Need to Work Longer Hours","label":"another-chance","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_3clwu9","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.436424644E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.436430466E9,"simScore":0.6385772702293564,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.436454613E9,"simScore":0.7820472160674105,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":1195,"links":[1194],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Scrambley","label":"r/personalfinance","duration":"","id":1195,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_csx6my1","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1194,"links":[1168],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"milapoonis","label":"currently doing that and I have about $7k saved up and I\u0027m 22, what do I do to get out?","duration":"","id":1194,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_csx6i57","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1168,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"farthumm","label":"Screw you Jeb Bush, as a man who worked his tail off to get out of my 12 hour a day production floor factory job that paid a measly $9/HR I feel 100% justified in saying you are out of touch with problems faced by the common man.","duration":"","id":1168,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cswulug","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Jeb Bush: People Need to Work Longer Hours","label":"another-chance","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_3clwu9","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.436424644E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.436430466E9,"simScore":0.6385772702293564,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.436454613E9,"simScore":0.7820472160674105,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.436454613E9,"simScore":1.0,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},{"index":1196,"links":[1194],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Bibibiforreal","label":"Borrow 10k more from your parents and move to Kansas and start a business and hire all of us, I guess.
