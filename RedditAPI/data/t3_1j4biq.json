scott keyes jul   pm credit credit getty images  credit getty images thats the overarching question as you set foot into the george w bush presidential center which opened last month on southern methodist universitys campus the answer uncomfortably in at least eight separate instances the library offers displays audio or video designed to give the impression that saddam hussein either possessed weapons of mass destruction or was on the verge of getting them its the beetlejuice approach say weapons of mass destruction enough times and they will appear to refresh one of the primary rationales the bush administration used to go to war with iraq was that countrys supposed possession of weapons of mass destruction secretary of state colin powell told the united nations security council that the facts and iraqs behavior show that saddam hussein and his regime are concealing their efforts to produce more weapons of mass destruction white house press secretary said wmds were what this war was about and it is about deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz agreed calling wmds the core reason for going to war bush himself made the case in an october  speech stating if we know saddam hussein has dangerous weapons today  and we do  does it make any sense for the world to wait to confront him as he grows even stronger and develops even more dangerous weapons after none were found the debate has been whether or not the bush administration deliberately misled about wmds in order convince the public and go to war but you wont see any hint of that debate walking through bushs presidential museum in fact unless you were a news junkie in the mids or a foreign policy aficionado you could be forgiven for thinking that iraq had either possessed wmds that were simply never found or were about to produce them had the us not gone to war for example the museum has a big display detailing the threat assessment of saddam hussein followed by the status by the end of bush presidency one curt sentence among the  lines notes that no stockpiles of wmd were found meanwhile twelve lines are devoted to the possible presence of wmds in iraq before the war and how we never have to worry about that now postwar including that saddam refused to account for his chemical biological and nuclear weapons programs and that postinvasion inspections confirmed that saddam hussein had the capacity to resume production of wmd  a timeline nearby also gives the impression that saddam was on the cusp of attaining wmds stopped only by bushs decision to go to war  even in the instances where the museum concedes that wmds didnt exist in iraq it still uses an asterisk approach to leave visitors with the impression they did or were about to one interactive panel tells users that although there were no wmd found the chief us weapons inspector found that hussein had a large number of wmd programrelated activities and never gave up its ambition to obtain wmd  similarly it later tells users that no stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction are found although iraqs wmdrelated program activities are still a threat  finally a document in the interactive detailed the wmd situation in iraq telling users that saddam wanted to recreate iraqs wmd capability because he saw significant value in possessing wmds  an audio tour also underscored the idea that saddam would have gotten wmd were it not for bushs decision to invade here are a few highlights narrator for  years the iraqi dictator defied the international community after september th he was a threat the united states could not ignore narrator ultimately no stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction were found in iraq however a report by chief weapons inspector charles duelfer revealed that saddam retained the ability to restart his weapons programs bush the duelfer report shows that saddam was gaming the system he was doing so with the intent of restarting his weapons program once the world looked away later a chooseyourownadventure style interactive features advisers who link saddam and  the world changed on  saddam shows every signs he wants to give terrorists weapons of mass destruction to attack the us a risk we cannot afford another unequivocally declares that saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction and dont forget during the gulf war we also discovered saddam was much further along in developing nuclear weapons than anyone believed  bush later came on screen and remarked saddam posed too big a risk to ignore he had used weapons of mass destruction in the past and showed every sign of continuing to pursue such weapons  to be sure one wouldnt necessarily expect that a museum dedicated to president bush would be highly critical of his decision to go to war that having been said the museum goes out of its way to muddy the water over the existence of wmds in iraq and leave visitors with the impression that the war was based on a justifiable truth not a verifiable falsehood indeed in the decade since  gopers have been so successful at obfuscating the issue that a poll earlier this year found that in republicans still believe that iraq possessed wmds prior to the war were any of that  percent of republicans to visit the museum in dallas they would likely walk away still believing that saddam had wmds and bush was right to take us to
