This is a completely retarded argument. Why would population numbers have anything to do with it? And where do we put the limit? How many people have to live in a country for it to be allowed to host the World cup? In fact, having less people could even be an advantage, as it would let more people from abroad come there and see the games.\n\n- Yes, Brazil has many existing stadiums before. But of those, none was used in it\u0027s existing state. They were either constructed for this world cup or reconstructed for the world cup.\n\n- The world cup isn\u0027t played in Rio, it\u0027s played in Brazil.

No, but Blatter established the FIFA ethic-commission and made Michael Garcia to the chief investigator about the corruption claims regarding the WC 2018 and 2022.      \n\nI am far from a Blatter fan, but the guy you responded to is a parade example for the \"I hate Blatter bandwagon\" someone who has no idea about FIFA Politics and the mood and/or opinions outside UEFA and CONCACAF.\n\nCould Blatter have done more against corruption? Yes, but to blame him for the shortcomings and criminal energy of other people is at least a bit unfair.\n\nFIFA is a Worldwide organisation, a lot of voting members coming from places where the grass is not so green, others are just greedy.

Looking at some of the criticism of the Qatar bid:\n\n**Re: \u0027they\u0027re not a football country\u0027**\n\nThe Qatar World Cup bid (and the purchase of PSG) is part of an effort to essentially protect the country by making it highly identified (and \u0027friendly\u0027) to the western world - we have seen exactly the same method employed by for example the Abu Dhabi Group at City, Roman Abramovich at Chelsea, Usmanov at Arsenal, not to mention others of course who have failed miserably such as Venky\u0027s at Blackburn, or perhaps Carson Yeung at Birmingham.  \n\n(Remains to be seen of course whether the current corruption allegations and spotlight on labour conditions actually harms their original intent - the case was made in a recent podcast, [*One World Sports AET: The FIFA Politics of Soft Power and Scandal*](http://www.beyondthepitch.net/podcasts/edition/index.cfm/one-world-sports-aet/2014/06/03/), that it\u0027s highly probable that it was Western PR agencies who have sold this venture to the Qataris in the first place, promising that they could improve their image and control the Western media spin.)\n\nAnyway when billionaires are using their wealth to fund clubs, many applaud their behaviour as \u0027simply necessary to break into the elite\u0027, or shrug their shoulders, or point out the positive things such investment can bring.  It\u0027s a tangential debate, but nevertheless frames the reasons why Qatar bid in the first place.  \n\nIn theory there\u0027s nothing wrong with what they are trying to do - and of course the same \u0027not a footballing country\u0027 argument could have been made against USA 1994, or Australia 2022.  \n\nIt also fits with the FIFA remit of globalising football, something which has paid off handsomely for other organisations such as the Man United brand, BSkyB, and of course the Premier League itself.\n\n**Re: the bidding process**\n\nIt certainly appears to have been deeply corrupt, however if it wasn\u0027t a Middle Eastern country we might not focus on it so much - the bidding process has likely been very corrupt in most countries for many years.  \n\nI posted yesterday about some of the scandals that occurred in the English approach to their bid, so I won\u0027t bother re-posting it now, suffice to say that the English are hardly above this method of influence in politics themselves - in fact currently helping Qatar in their time of \u0027media spin\u0027 troubles is none other than [former head of the FA David Davies](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football//article4108374.ece).\n\nIn addition the recent Olympics in London was prey to [\u0027gravy train\u0027 behaviour](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football/article4107289.ece), and of course arguably the biggest sporting-event bidding scandal prior to the recent Qatar allegations [actually came out of the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Winter_Olympic_bid_scandal).\n\nI think there is also possibly some misunderstanding about Platini\u0027s involvement.  \n\nPlatini, like Blatter, has based his political power on a platform of inclusion for the \u0027smaller\u0027 countries.  So basically that\u0027s his \u0027campaign promise\u0027, and therefore excludes him from backing, for example, the US.  \n\nThe allegation against him is that French president Sarkozy pressured him into a quid-pro-quo vote for Qatar, in order to push for Qatari investment in France (which of course has happened with PSG, not sure about other sectors).  So basically you have a *French* president pressuring a *French* representative to side with the needs of *French* industry.   Even if the allegations are true, for me this doesn\u0027t really seem like the crime of the century or anything.\n\nThere is also the side issue of the English media vs Platini.  They seem to hate Platini for several reasons, but one of them is FFP - his attempts to curb spending have been met with much criticism, some justified of course.   \n\nHowever I find this a touch hypocritical, since the Qatari investment in the World Cup is, as I attempted to describe above, not really so different to the vast investment we\u0027ve seen in the Premier League, something which the PL and FA have certainly not been shy about courting, and the media have generally been in favour of.\n\nNote I\u0027m not saying that those found guilty of corruption in the Qatar bid shouldn\u0027t be punished, I\u0027m simply trying to point out some double standards in reporting.\n\n\n**Re: the heat**\n\nThis is already an issue in Brazil with a current lawsuit against FIFA by the Brazilian players\u0027 union.  It was also an issue in US 1994.  \n\nFurthermore Qatar\u0027s bid involved air-conditioned stadia which would then be shipped to other countries - so, if actually achieved, their bid could have done a lot of good for other places, rather than creating \u0027white elephants\u0027 as is the case after many sporting events.   \n\nI\u0027m unaware of any other country or bid to have attempted such a project of \u0027transportable\u0027 stadia - although sadly we can probably assume that the subsequent distribution of the stadia would have been subject to just as much corruption.\n\nBut in any case their bid *could* have been painted in the media as a very ambitious engineering project, rather than simple folly.  I haven\u0027t seen the bid videos so I don\u0027t know how convincing it was, but if they could achieve this (including moving the stadia afterwards), I don\u0027t see anything that is inherently terminal about this aspect of the bid.  \n\nThe Brazil bid in this respect is probably worse, since it had no plans to move the stadia (such as the one in Manaus) afterwards.\n\nI wonder how the Qatar bid was perceived in architectural circles, before any allegations of corruption came out?  Would be interesting to know the strictly technical views on the topic, rather than political ones.\n\n\n**Re: human rights abuses**\n\nIf we are to consider the human rights issues in Qatar a reason to bar them from hosting the World Cup, we should hold all countries to the same standard.  \n\nIn that case the US for one should certainly never host a sporting event ever again:  *decades* of illegal wars and interference in sovereign democracies, legalised torture, drone killings of civilians without trial, subjugation of its own citizens via the prison-industrial complex, capital punishment, spying and wire-tapping on a massive scale, abuse of migrant workers, and of course its own \u0027money talks\u0027 attitude towards politics with what amounts to legalised bribery in the form of \u0027lobbying\u0027, \u0027corporate personhood\u0027, \u0027pork\u0027, etc.  \n\nI apologise for bringing the politics into this sub and I realise these are complex issues that I am certainly unqualified to comment on - but we cannot hold one country to a high standard while giving others a pass.\n\nAs for the argument that the labour conditions in Qatar affect the WC stadia directly, which is why it\u0027s relevant while the various transgressions of other countries are not - that\u0027s a fair point I suppose, but in that case issues in Qatar regarding homosexuality and womens\u0027 rights etc should not enter the discussion either.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe all have subconscious biases and particularly towards the unknown.   This is not an accusation of racism btw, it\u0027s simply human nature.   \n\nI\u0027d wager only a very small percentage of the readership here in /r/soccer are from (or familiar) with the Middle East - a part of the world with which the West has essentially been \u0027at war\u0027 for many years now.  \n\n(Obviously the situation is far more complex than that, but the majority readership of this website has lived through a prism of yellow journalism which has framed the issues in this manner for possibly their entire lives).  \n\nSo the Middle East (and by proxy Qatar) is basically \u0027the enemy\u0027, and has been accordingly demonised in the press.  Hence why their World Cup bid has attracted such vitriol from the start, more so than other countries which are possibly equally as guilty of various infringements or abuses.\n\nAlso let\u0027s not forget that it\u0027s the English media leading the charge against the corruption - which is absolutely laudable - but certainly carries its own \u0027back-room politics\u0027 aspect since England not only lost out in their bid but also suffered deep embarassment in the process.\n\nBottom line is I wouldn\u0027t call it racism but I do see some hypocrisy.  \n\nThat\u0027s not to say that these corruption allegations shouldn\u0027t be exposed completely though - FIFA as an organisation seems to exist purely to milk the \u0027gravy train\u0027 and certainly seems in serious need of reform and oversight - although to be honest I\u0027m dubious that any kind of reform will ever happen, when the common man seems to have precious little influence on any political figures or those who control the money, the so-called \u00271%\u0027.   \n\nNevertheless we should be careful not to become the simple \u0027attack dogs\u0027 (or \u0027pitchforks\u0027 I suppose it would be in reddit-speak) without proper background information and historical context.\n\nAt the end of the day, like muppets we\u0027ll just watch the show anyway, the classic \u0027bread and circuses\u0027 method which I suppose has worked since the dawn of civilisation.\n\n","duration":"","id":168,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_ci3bt2s","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"BBC Sport - Qatar 2022: Sepp Blatter says corruption claims are racist","label":"looeeyeah","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_27ppi8","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.402365064E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.402378998E9,"simScore":0.6990655571280502,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":169,"links":[168],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"not_so_bad_andy","label":"There were a lot of words in their bid with regards to their stadia, and little action.

Looking at some of the criticism of the Qatar bid:\n\n**Re: \u0027they\u0027re not a football country\u0027**\n\nThe Qatar World Cup bid (and the purchase of PSG) is part of an effort to essentially protect the country by making it highly identified (and \u0027friendly\u0027) to the western world - we have seen exactly the same method employed by for example the Abu Dhabi Group at City, Roman Abramovich at Chelsea, Usmanov at Arsenal, not to mention others of course who have failed miserably such as Venky\u0027s at Blackburn, or perhaps Carson Yeung at Birmingham.  \n\n(Remains to be seen of course whether the current corruption allegations and spotlight on labour conditions actually harms their original intent - the case was made in a recent podcast, [*One World Sports AET: The FIFA Politics of Soft Power and Scandal*](http://www.beyondthepitch.net/podcasts/edition/index.cfm/one-world-sports-aet/2014/06/03/), that it\u0027s highly probable that it was Western PR agencies who have sold this venture to the Qataris in the first place, promising that they could improve their image and control the Western media spin.)\n\nAnyway when billionaires are using their wealth to fund clubs, many applaud their behaviour as \u0027simply necessary to break into the elite\u0027, or shrug their shoulders, or point out the positive things such investment can bring.  It\u0027s a tangential debate, but nevertheless frames the reasons why Qatar bid in the first place.  \n\nIn theory there\u0027s nothing wrong with what they are trying to do - and of course the same \u0027not a footballing country\u0027 argument could have been made against USA 1994, or Australia 2022.  \n\nIt also fits with the FIFA remit of globalising football, something which has paid off handsomely for other organisations such as the Man United brand, BSkyB, and of course the Premier League itself.\n\n**Re: the bidding process**\n\nIt certainly appears to have been deeply corrupt, however if it wasn\u0027t a Middle Eastern country we might not focus on it so much - the bidding process has likely been very corrupt in most countries for many years.  \n\nI posted yesterday about some of the scandals that occurred in the English approach to their bid, so I won\u0027t bother re-posting it now, suffice to say that the English are hardly above this method of influence in politics themselves - in fact currently helping Qatar in their time of \u0027media spin\u0027 troubles is none other than [former head of the FA David Davies](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football//article4108374.ece).\n\nIn addition the recent Olympics in London was prey to [\u0027gravy train\u0027 behaviour](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football/article4107289.ece), and of course arguably the biggest sporting-event bidding scandal prior to the recent Qatar allegations [actually came out of the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Winter_Olympic_bid_scandal).\n\nI think there is also possibly some misunderstanding about Platini\u0027s involvement.  \n\nPlatini, like Blatter, has based his political power on a platform of inclusion for the \u0027smaller\u0027 countries.  So basically that\u0027s his \u0027campaign promise\u0027, and therefore excludes him from backing, for example, the US.  \n\nThe allegation against him is that French president Sarkozy pressured him into a quid-pro-quo vote for Qatar, in order to push for Qatari investment in France (which of course has happened with PSG, not sure about other sectors).  So basically you have a *French* president pressuring a *French* representative to side with the needs of *French* industry.   Even if the allegations are true, for me this doesn\u0027t really seem like the crime of the century or anything.\n\nThere is also the side issue of the English media vs Platini.  They seem to hate Platini for several reasons, but one of them is FFP - his attempts to curb spending have been met with much criticism, some justified of course.   \n\nHowever I find this a touch hypocritical, since the Qatari investment in the World Cup is, as I attempted to describe above, not really so different to the vast investment we\u0027ve seen in the Premier League, something which the PL and FA have certainly not been shy about courting, and the media have generally been in favour of.\n\nNote I\u0027m not saying that those found guilty of corruption in the Qatar bid shouldn\u0027t be punished, I\u0027m simply trying to point out some double standards in reporting.\n\n\n**Re: the heat**\n\nThis is already an issue in Brazil with a current lawsuit against FIFA by the Brazilian players\u0027 union.  It was also an issue in US 1994.  \n\nFurthermore Qatar\u0027s bid involved air-conditioned stadia which would then be shipped to other countries - so, if actually achieved, their bid could have done a lot of good for other places, rather than creating \u0027white elephants\u0027 as is the case after many sporting events.   \n\nI\u0027m unaware of any other country or bid to have attempted such a project of \u0027transportable\u0027 stadia - although sadly we can probably assume that the subsequent distribution of the stadia would have been subject to just as much corruption.\n\nBut in any case their bid *could* have been painted in the media as a very ambitious engineering project, rather than simple folly.  I haven\u0027t seen the bid videos so I don\u0027t know how convincing it was, but if they could achieve this (including moving the stadia afterwards), I don\u0027t see anything that is inherently terminal about this aspect of the bid.  \n\nThe Brazil bid in this respect is probably worse, since it had no plans to move the stadia (such as the one in Manaus) afterwards.\n\nI wonder how the Qatar bid was perceived in architectural circles, before any allegations of corruption came out?

Qatar doesn\u0027t need to \u0027protect\u0027 itself from the western world, and owning a few football clubs etc would not do this anyway.

However, the key in this is when it\u0027s combined with the other factors - i.e. that Qatar are in no way capable of hosting this tournament properly, and actually made a bid which they cannot implement. As far as I\u0027m aware, that\u0027s unique.\n\n\u0026gt;There is also the side issue of the English media vs Platini.

That\u0027s a matter for FIFA (and indeed the IOC when it came to Russia\u0027s Winter Olympics) and they bottled it. It\u0027s all very well trying to sort out homophobia in football, but then hosting the event in a homophobic country...\n\n\u0026gt;We all have subconscious biases and particularly towards the unknown\n\nBut that\u0027s the problem - it isn\u0027t the unknown!\n\n\u0026gt;I\u0027d wager only a very small percentage of the readership here in /r/soccer are from (or familiar) with the Middle East - a part of the world with which the West has essentially been \u0027at war\u0027 for many years now. \n\nYes and no, but I don\u0027t see what relevance that has. For the record, I have a history degree and have had a specific focus on Middle Eastern political issues for...must be 10 years now. Any views I have on the political situation there are formed by research etc, as opposed to gut instinct. \n\n\u0026gt;So the Middle East (and by proxy Qatar) is basically \u0027the enemy\u0027, and has been accordingly demonised in the press. \n\nNot really - for a start, the press isn\u0027t one homogenised body. \n\n\u0026gt;Also let\u0027s not forget that it\u0027s the English media leading the charge against the corruption - which is absolutely laudable - but certainly carries its own \u0027back-room politics\u0027 aspect since England not only lost out in their bid but also suffered deep embarassment in the process.\n\nDeep embarassment? Really? In what way? I agree there\u0027s corruption in the English media, but there\u0027s corruption everywhere. The media have been called out on theirs (phone tapping etc). Qatar should be called out on theirs, now that there is evidence.\n\n\u0026gt;Bottom line is I wouldn\u0027t call it racism but I do see some hypocrisy. \n\nWhether it\u0027s hypocritical isn\u0027t relevant - the only thing that\u0027s relevant is if it\u0027s true.\n\n\n","duration":"","id":171,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_ci3tn0q","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":168,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"charzan","label":"Not sure about racism but certainly there are some double standards in the reporting, at least from a UK point of view, and certainly here in /r/soccer.

It\u0027s a tangential debate, but nevertheless frames the reasons why Qatar bid in the first place.  \n\nIn theory there\u0027s nothing wrong with what they are trying to do - and of course the same \u0027not a footballing country\u0027 argument could have been made against USA 1994, or Australia 2022.  \n\nIt also fits with the FIFA remit of globalising football, something which has paid off handsomely for other organisations such as the Man United brand, BSkyB, and of course the Premier League itself.\n\n**Re: the bidding process**\n\nIt certainly appears to have been deeply corrupt, however if it wasn\u0027t a Middle Eastern country we might not focus on it so much - the bidding process has likely been very corrupt in most countries for many years.  \n\nI posted yesterday about some of the scandals that occurred in the English approach to their bid, so I won\u0027t bother re-posting it now, suffice to say that the English are hardly above this method of influence in politics themselves - in fact currently helping Qatar in their time of \u0027media spin\u0027 troubles is none other than [former head of the FA David Davies](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football//article4108374.ece).\n\nIn addition the recent Olympics in London was prey to [\u0027gravy train\u0027 behaviour](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football/article4107289.ece), and of course arguably the biggest sporting-event bidding scandal prior to the recent Qatar allegations [actually came out of the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Winter_Olympic_bid_scandal).\n\nI think there is also possibly some misunderstanding about Platini\u0027s involvement.  \n\nPlatini, like Blatter, has based his political power on a platform of inclusion for the \u0027smaller\u0027 countries.  So basically that\u0027s his \u0027campaign promise\u0027, and therefore excludes him from backing, for example, the US.  \n\nThe allegation against him is that French president Sarkozy pressured him into a quid-pro-quo vote for Qatar, in order to push for Qatari investment in France (which of course has happened with PSG, not sure about other sectors).  So basically you have a *French* president pressuring a *French* representative to side with the needs of *French* industry.   Even if the allegations are true, for me this doesn\u0027t really seem like the crime of the century or anything.\n\nThere is also the side issue of the English media vs Platini.  They seem to hate Platini for several reasons, but one of them is FFP - his attempts to curb spending have been met with much criticism, some justified of course.   \n\nHowever I find this a touch hypocritical, since the Qatari investment in the World Cup is, as I attempted to describe above, not really so different to the vast investment we\u0027ve seen in the Premier League, something which the PL and FA have certainly not been shy about courting, and the media have generally been in favour of.\n\nNote I\u0027m not saying that those found guilty of corruption in the Qatar bid shouldn\u0027t be punished, I\u0027m simply trying to point out some double standards in reporting.\n\n\n**Re: the heat**\n\nThis is already an issue in Brazil with a current lawsuit against FIFA by the Brazilian players\u0027 union.  It was also an issue in US 1994.  \n\nFurthermore Qatar\u0027s bid involved air-conditioned stadia which would then be shipped to other countries - so, if actually achieved, their bid could have done a lot of good for other places, rather than creating \u0027white elephants\u0027 as is the case after many sporting events.   \n\nI\u0027m unaware of any other country or bid to have attempted such a project of \u0027transportable\u0027 stadia - although sadly we can probably assume that the subsequent distribution of the stadia would have been subject to just as much corruption.\n\nBut in any case their bid *could* have been painted in the media as a very ambitious engineering project, rather than simple folly.  I haven\u0027t seen the bid videos so I don\u0027t know how convincing it was, but if they could achieve this (including moving the stadia afterwards), I don\u0027t see anything that is inherently terminal about this aspect of the bid.  \n\nThe Brazil bid in this respect is probably worse, since it had no plans to move the stadia (such as the one in Manaus) afterwards.\n\nI wonder how the Qatar bid was perceived in architectural circles, before any allegations of corruption came out?  Would be interesting to know the strictly technical views on the topic, rather than political ones.\n\n\n**Re: human rights abuses**\n\nIf we are to consider the human rights issues in Qatar a reason to bar them from hosting the World Cup, we should hold all countries to the same standard.  \n\nIn that case the US for one should certainly never host a sporting event ever again:  *decades* of illegal wars and interference in sovereign democracies, legalised torture, drone killings of civilians without trial, subjugation of its own citizens via the prison-industrial complex, capital punishment, spying and wire-tapping on a massive scale, abuse of migrant workers, and of course its own \u0027money talks\u0027 attitude towards politics with what amounts to legalised bribery in the form of \u0027lobbying\u0027, \u0027corporate personhood\u0027, \u0027pork\u0027, etc.  \n\nI apologise for bringing the politics into this sub and I realise these are complex issues that I am certainly unqualified to comment on - but we cannot hold one country to a high standard while giving others a pass.\n\nAs for the argument that the labour conditions in Qatar affect the WC stadia directly, which is why it\u0027s relevant while the various transgressions of other countries are not - that\u0027s a fair point I suppose, but in that case issues in Qatar regarding homosexuality and womens\u0027 rights etc should not enter the discussion either.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe all have subconscious biases and particularly towards the unknown.

It was the same with Abramovich etc. Let\u0027s not try and pretend there\u0027s some great humanitarian goal behind this. \n\nI think we\u0027re making the same point - I did not describe the investment as \u0027humanitarian\u0027, and I drew the same comparison to Abramovich.  \n\nThe podcast I linked to describes the \u0027soft power\u0027 / PR approach better than I could, but the point I was trying to make is that we (in England) rarely seem to have a problem with investment in the sport from \u0027dubious sources\u0027 - witness the ineffectiveness of the \u0027Fit and Proper\u0027 test.   \n\nSo by the same logic, why should our attitudes be so different when a rich outsider attempts to insert themselves into an international competition.\n\n\n\u0026gt; I wouldn\u0027t promote the \u0027not a footballing country\u0027 argument as a reason not to give them it, but you can\u0027t compare Qatar to USA \u002794 or Australia. Both nations, whilst maybe not at the top end of world football have established leagues and international teams. What does Qatar have?\n\nI agree with your first sentence.   Part of FIFA\u0027s remit post-Rous has been globalisation, so whatever \u0027footballing heritage\u0027 Qatar may or may not have is totally irrelevant to their appraisal of the bid.\n\n\n\u0026gt;  What\u0027s the point of a bidding process if your bid is scored on factors which you then don\u0027t have to implement? It\u0027s indefensible.\n\nNow this is a crucial point for me.  If they are *not capable* of fulfilling their bid, why has this not been pursued as the best angle to have the location awarded elsewhere? \n\nSurely this would be easier than pursuing corruption allegations which it seems will probably be tied to Bin Hammam\u0027s election bid, and therefore irrelevant to the Qatar bid.\n\n\u0026gt; But that\u0027s the problem - [Qatar] isn\u0027t the unknown!\n\nYour post is a welcome rebuttal, but the majority of the discourse I have seen here does not seem to seek any understanding of the background issues nor the historical context.  \n\nI\u0027m not saying I know any better because I don\u0027t - my only point of perspective is that I have followed the story in both the French and the English press.\n\nI am always happy to be corrected on anything that I\u0027ve got wrong.  \n\nMy post was not intended to defend the Qatar bid, but simply to point out double standards in the reporting -  and specifically the topic of this submission, which is Blatter\u0027s claim that the corruption allegations are fuelled by \u0027racism\u0027.  \n\nI don\u0027t believe they are, but I think there is certainly an element of mistrust of the Middle East at play, and this can be seen in the double standards which I attempted to describe in my original post.\n\n\n\u0026gt; Deep embarassment? Really? In what way? \n\nI was referring to the allegations which led to [Lord Triesman stepping down](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/7730442/Lord-Triesman-resigns-as-FA-chairman-and-from-Englands-World-Cup-2018-bid-team.html), which I believe caused deep embarassment specifically to those involved in the English bid.   \n\n\u0026gt; Whether it\u0027s hypocritical isn\u0027t relevant - the only thing that\u0027s relevant is if it\u0027s true.\n\nSorry I disagree, we cannot hold different countries to different standards, that is the definition of hypocrisy and it is absolutely relevant.  \n\nHypocrisy and double standards will completely delegitimise any attempts to expose corruption.\n\n****\n\n\\*edit - You wanted something on Platini\u0027s relationship with the English media.  He discusses it [here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/9043006/Michel-Platini-why-do-the-English-hate-me-Im-French.html):\n\n\u0026gt; Platini’s policies, and his habit of speaking frankly, have repeatedly got under the skin of English football, particularly at Premier League headquarters. That, in turn, has got under his, though not as much as the hostility he sometimes receives from the English media.\n\nI accept that\u0027s probably not enough \u0027evidence\u0027 for you - all I can say is in my ~20-odd years living here in London I have never got the feeling that the English media (and yes I accept they are not a single monolithic creature, although it sometimes seems that way) like him very much.","duration":"","id":172,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_ci3w33u","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":171,"links":[168],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"lordzoot","label":"\u0026gt;The Qatar World Cup bid (and the purchase of PSG) is part of an effort to essentially protect the country by making it highly identified (and \u0027friendly\u0027) to the western world - we have seen exactly the same method employed by for example the Abu Dhabi Group at City, Roman Abramovich at Chelsea, Usmanov at Arsenal, not to mention others of course who have failed miserably such as Venky\u0027s at Blackburn, or perhaps Carson Yeung at Birmingham. \n\nI disagree.

What does Qatar have?\n\n\u0026gt;It certainly appears to have been deeply corrupt, however if it wasn\u0027t a Middle Eastern country we might not focus on it so much - the bidding process has likely been very corrupt in most countries for many years. \n\nAgreed. However, the key in this is when it\u0027s combined with the other factors - i.e. that Qatar are in no way capable of hosting this tournament properly, and actually made a bid which they cannot implement. As far as I\u0027m aware, that\u0027s unique.\n\n\u0026gt;There is also the side issue of the English media vs Platini. They seem to hate Platini for several reasons, but one of them is FFP - his attempts to curb spending have been met with much criticism, some justified of course. \n\nDisagree. Strongly. You\u0027d need to provide me with some good evidence to suggest the media hate Platini.\n\n\u0026gt;But in any case their bid could have been painted in the media as a very ambitious engineering project, rather than simple folly.\n\nBut that\u0027s the point - everybody thought it was far fetched, and lo and behold - it was! And now they\u0027re talking about a winter world cup to get around it. What\u0027s the point of a bidding process if your bid is scored on factors which you then don\u0027t have to implement? It\u0027s indefensible. \n\n\u0026gt;I wonder how the Qatar bid was perceived in architectural circles, before any allegations of corruption came out? Would be interesting to know the strictly technical views on the topic, rather than political ones.\n\nA lot of the initial questioning came from engineering circles, with many people in the industry just looking at it like \u0027uh..\u0027.\n\n\u0026gt;If we are to consider the human rights issues in Qatar a reason to bar them from hosting the World Cup, we should hold all countries to the same standard. \n\nAgreed. But it must be seen that these abuses are directly in connection with the event.

That\u0027s a matter for FIFA (and indeed the IOC when it came to Russia\u0027s Winter Olympics) and they bottled it. It\u0027s all very well trying to sort out homophobia in football, but then hosting the event in a homophobic country...\n\n\u0026gt;We all have subconscious biases and particularly towards the unknown\n\nBut that\u0027s the problem - it isn\u0027t the unknown!\n\n\u0026gt;I\u0027d wager only a very small percentage of the readership here in /r/soccer are from (or familiar) with the Middle East - a part of the world with which the West has essentially been \u0027at war\u0027 for many years now. \n\nYes and no, but I don\u0027t see what relevance that has. For the record, I have a history degree and have had a specific focus on Middle Eastern political issues for...must be 10 years now. Any views I have on the political situation there are formed by research etc, as opposed to gut instinct. \n\n\u0026gt;So the Middle East (and by proxy Qatar) is basically \u0027the enemy\u0027, and has been accordingly demonised in the press. \n\nNot really - for a start, the press isn\u0027t one homogenised body. \n\n\u0026gt;Also let\u0027s not forget that it\u0027s the English media leading the charge against the corruption - which is absolutely laudable - but certainly carries its own \u0027back-room politics\u0027 aspect since England not only lost out in their bid but also suffered deep embarassment in the process.\n\nDeep embarassment? Really? In what way? I agree there\u0027s corruption in the English media, but there\u0027s corruption everywhere. The media have been called out on theirs (phone tapping etc).

Looking at some of the criticism of the Qatar bid:\n\n**Re: \u0027they\u0027re not a football country\u0027**\n\nThe Qatar World Cup bid (and the purchase of PSG) is part of an effort to essentially protect the country by making it highly identified (and \u0027friendly\u0027) to the western world - we have seen exactly the same method employed by for example the Abu Dhabi Group at City, Roman Abramovich at Chelsea, Usmanov at Arsenal, not to mention others of course who have failed miserably such as Venky\u0027s at Blackburn, or perhaps Carson Yeung at Birmingham.  \n\n(Remains to be seen of course whether the current corruption allegations and spotlight on labour conditions actually harms their original intent - the case was made in a recent podcast, [*One World Sports AET: The FIFA Politics of Soft Power and Scandal*](http://www.beyondthepitch.net/podcasts/edition/index.cfm/one-world-sports-aet/2014/06/03/), that it\u0027s highly probable that it was Western PR agencies who have sold this venture to the Qataris in the first place, promising that they could improve their image and control the Western media spin.)\n\nAnyway when billionaires are using their wealth to fund clubs, many applaud their behaviour as \u0027simply necessary to break into the elite\u0027, or shrug their shoulders, or point out the positive things such investment can bring.  It\u0027s a tangential debate, but nevertheless frames the reasons why Qatar bid in the first place.  \n\nIn theory there\u0027s nothing wrong with what they are trying to do - and of course the same \u0027not a footballing country\u0027 argument could have been made against USA 1994, or Australia 2022.  \n\nIt also fits with the FIFA remit of globalising football, something which has paid off handsomely for other organisations such as the Man United brand, BSkyB, and of course the Premier League itself.\n\n**Re: the bidding process**\n\nIt certainly appears to have been deeply corrupt, however if it wasn\u0027t a Middle Eastern country we might not focus on it so much - the bidding process has likely been very corrupt in most countries for many years.  \n\nI posted yesterday about some of the scandals that occurred in the English approach to their bid, so I won\u0027t bother re-posting it now, suffice to say that the English are hardly above this method of influence in politics themselves - in fact currently helping Qatar in their time of \u0027media spin\u0027 troubles is none other than [former head of the FA David Davies](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football//article4108374.ece).\n\nIn addition the recent Olympics in London was prey to [\u0027gravy train\u0027 behaviour](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football/article4107289.ece), and of course arguably the biggest sporting-event bidding scandal prior to the recent Qatar allegations [actually came out of the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Winter_Olympic_bid_scandal).\n\nI think there is also possibly some misunderstanding about Platini\u0027s involvement.  \n\nPlatini, like Blatter, has based his political power on a platform of inclusion for the \u0027smaller\u0027 countries.  So basically that\u0027s his \u0027campaign promise\u0027, and therefore excludes him from backing, for example, the US.  \n\nThe allegation against him is that French president Sarkozy pressured him into a quid-pro-quo vote for Qatar, in order to push for Qatari investment in France (which of course has happened with PSG, not sure about other sectors).  So basically you have a *French* president pressuring a *French* representative to side with the needs of *French* industry.   Even if the allegations are true, for me this doesn\u0027t really seem like the crime of the century or anything.\n\nThere is also the side issue of the English media vs Platini.  They seem to hate Platini for several reasons, but one of them is FFP - his attempts to curb spending have been met with much criticism, some justified of course.   \n\nHowever I find this a touch hypocritical, since the Qatari investment in the World Cup is, as I attempted to describe above, not really so different to the vast investment we\u0027ve seen in the Premier League, something which the PL and FA have certainly not been shy about courting, and the media have generally been in favour of.\n\nNote I\u0027m not saying that those found guilty of corruption in the Qatar bid shouldn\u0027t be punished, I\u0027m simply trying to point out some double standards in reporting.\n\n\n**Re: the heat**\n\nThis is already an issue in Brazil with a current lawsuit against FIFA by the Brazilian players\u0027 union.  It was also an issue in US 1994.  \n\nFurthermore Qatar\u0027s bid involved air-conditioned stadia which would then be shipped to other countries - so, if actually achieved, their bid could have done a lot of good for other places, rather than creating \u0027white elephants\u0027 as is the case after many sporting events.   \n\nI\u0027m unaware of any other country or bid to have attempted such a project of \u0027transportable\u0027 stadia - although sadly we can probably assume that the subsequent distribution of the stadia would have been subject to just as much corruption.\n\nBut in any case their bid *could* have been painted in the media as a very ambitious engineering project, rather than simple folly.  I haven\u0027t seen the bid videos so I don\u0027t know how convincing it was, but if they could achieve this (including moving the stadia afterwards), I don\u0027t see anything that is inherently terminal about this aspect of the bid.  \n\nThe Brazil bid in this respect is probably worse, since it had no plans to move the stadia (such as the one in Manaus) afterwards.\n\nI wonder how the Qatar bid was perceived in architectural circles, before any allegations of corruption came out?

Looking at some of the criticism of the Qatar bid:\n\n**Re: \u0027they\u0027re not a football country\u0027**\n\nThe Qatar World Cup bid (and the purchase of PSG) is part of an effort to essentially protect the country by making it highly identified (and \u0027friendly\u0027) to the western world - we have seen exactly the same method employed by for example the Abu Dhabi Group at City, Roman Abramovich at Chelsea, Usmanov at Arsenal, not to mention others of course who have failed miserably such as Venky\u0027s at Blackburn, or perhaps Carson Yeung at Birmingham.  \n\n(Remains to be seen of course whether the current corruption allegations and spotlight on labour conditions actually harms their original intent - the case was made in a recent podcast, [*One World Sports AET: The FIFA Politics of Soft Power and Scandal*](http://www.beyondthepitch.net/podcasts/edition/index.cfm/one-world-sports-aet/2014/06/03/), that it\u0027s highly probable that it was Western PR agencies who have sold this venture to the Qataris in the first place, promising that they could improve their image and control the Western media spin.)\n\nAnyway when billionaires are using their wealth to fund clubs, many applaud their behaviour as \u0027simply necessary to break into the elite\u0027, or shrug their shoulders, or point out the positive things such investment can bring.  It\u0027s a tangential debate, but nevertheless frames the reasons why Qatar bid in the first place.  \n\nIn theory there\u0027s nothing wrong with what they are trying to do - and of course the same \u0027not a footballing country\u0027 argument could have been made against USA 1994, or Australia 2022.  \n\nIt also fits with the FIFA remit of globalising football, something which has paid off handsomely for other organisations such as the Man United brand, BSkyB, and of course the Premier League itself.\n\n**Re: the bidding process**\n\nIt certainly appears to have been deeply corrupt, however if it wasn\u0027t a Middle Eastern country we might not focus on it so much - the bidding process has likely been very corrupt in most countries for many years.  \n\nI posted yesterday about some of the scandals that occurred in the English approach to their bid, so I won\u0027t bother re-posting it now, suffice to say that the English are hardly above this method of influence in politics themselves - in fact currently helping Qatar in their time of \u0027media spin\u0027 troubles is none other than [former head of the FA David Davies](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football//article4108374.ece).\n\nIn addition the recent Olympics in London was prey to [\u0027gravy train\u0027 behaviour](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football/article4107289.ece), and of course arguably the biggest sporting-event bidding scandal prior to the recent Qatar allegations [actually came out of the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Winter_Olympic_bid_scandal).\n\nI think there is also possibly some misunderstanding about Platini\u0027s involvement.  \n\nPlatini, like Blatter, has based his political power on a platform of inclusion for the \u0027smaller\u0027 countries.  So basically that\u0027s his \u0027campaign promise\u0027, and therefore excludes him from backing, for example, the US.  \n\nThe allegation against him is that French president Sarkozy pressured him into a quid-pro-quo vote for Qatar, in order to push for Qatari investment in France (which of course has happened with PSG, not sure about other sectors).  So basically you have a *French* president pressuring a *French* representative to side with the needs of *French* industry.   Even if the allegations are true, for me this doesn\u0027t really seem like the crime of the century or anything.\n\nThere is also the side issue of the English media vs Platini.  They seem to hate Platini for several reasons, but one of them is FFP - his attempts to curb spending have been met with much criticism, some justified of course.   \n\nHowever I find this a touch hypocritical, since the Qatari investment in the World Cup is, as I attempted to describe above, not really so different to the vast investment we\u0027ve seen in the Premier League, something which the PL and FA have certainly not been shy about courting, and the media have generally been in favour of.\n\nNote I\u0027m not saying that those found guilty of corruption in the Qatar bid shouldn\u0027t be punished, I\u0027m simply trying to point out some double standards in reporting.\n\n\n**Re: the heat**\n\nThis is already an issue in Brazil with a current lawsuit against FIFA by the Brazilian players\u0027 union.  It was also an issue in US 1994.  \n\nFurthermore Qatar\u0027s bid involved air-conditioned stadia which would then be shipped to other countries - so, if actually achieved, their bid could have done a lot of good for other places, rather than creating \u0027white elephants\u0027 as is the case after many sporting events.   \n\nI\u0027m unaware of any other country or bid to have attempted such a project of \u0027transportable\u0027 stadia - although sadly we can probably assume that the subsequent distribution of the stadia would have been subject to just as much corruption.\n\nBut in any case their bid *could* have been painted in the media as a very ambitious engineering project, rather than simple folly.  I haven\u0027t seen the bid videos so I don\u0027t know how convincing it was, but if they could achieve this (including moving the stadia afterwards), I don\u0027t see anything that is inherently terminal about this aspect of the bid.  \n\nThe Brazil bid in this respect is probably worse, since it had no plans to move the stadia (such as the one in Manaus) afterwards.\n\nI wonder how the Qatar bid was perceived in architectural circles, before any allegations of corruption came out?  Would be interesting to know the strictly technical views on the topic, rather than political ones.\n\n\n**Re: human rights abuses**\n\nIf we are to consider the human rights issues in Qatar a reason to bar them from hosting the World Cup, we should hold all countries to the same standard.  \n\nIn that case the US for one should certainly never host a sporting event ever again:  *decades* of illegal wars and interference in sovereign democracies, legalised torture, drone killings of civilians without trial, subjugation of its own citizens via the prison-industrial complex, capital punishment, spying and wire-tapping on a massive scale, abuse of migrant workers, and of course its own \u0027money talks\u0027 attitude towards politics with what amounts to legalised bribery in the form of \u0027lobbying\u0027, \u0027corporate personhood\u0027, \u0027pork\u0027, etc.  \n\nI apologise for bringing the politics into this sub and I realise these are complex issues that I am certainly unqualified to comment on - but we cannot hold one country to a high standard while giving others a pass.\n\nAs for the argument that the labour conditions in Qatar affect the WC stadia directly, which is why it\u0027s relevant while the various transgressions of other countries are not - that\u0027s a fair point I suppose, but in that case issues in Qatar regarding homosexuality and womens\u0027 rights etc should not enter the discussion either.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe all have subconscious biases and particularly towards the unknown.   This is not an accusation of racism btw, it\u0027s simply human nature.   \n\nI\u0027d wager only a very small percentage of the readership here in /r/soccer are from (or familiar) with the Middle East - a part of the world with which the West has essentially been \u0027at war\u0027 for many years now.  \n\n(Obviously the situation is far more complex than that, but the majority readership of this website has lived through a prism of yellow journalism which has framed the issues in this manner for possibly their entire lives).  \n\nSo the Middle East (and by proxy Qatar) is basically \u0027the enemy\u0027, and has been accordingly demonised in the press.  Hence why their World Cup bid has attracted such vitriol from the start, more so than other countries which are possibly equally as guilty of various infringements or abuses.\n\nAlso let\u0027s not forget that it\u0027s the English media leading the charge against the corruption - which is absolutely laudable - but certainly carries its own \u0027back-room politics\u0027 aspect since England not only lost out in their bid but also suffered deep embarassment in the process.\n\nBottom line is I wouldn\u0027t call it racism but I do see some hypocrisy.  \n\nThat\u0027s not to say that these corruption allegations shouldn\u0027t be exposed completely though - FIFA as an organisation seems to exist purely to milk the \u0027gravy train\u0027 and certainly seems in serious need of reform and oversight - although to be honest I\u0027m dubious that any kind of reform will ever happen, when the common man seems to have precious little influence on any political figures or those who control the money, the so-called \u00271%\u0027.   \n\nNevertheless we should be careful not to become the simple \u0027attack dogs\u0027 (or \u0027pitchforks\u0027 I suppose it would be in reddit-speak) without proper background information and historical context.\n\nAt the end of the day, like muppets we\u0027ll just watch the show anyway, the classic \u0027bread and circuses\u0027 method which I suppose has worked since the dawn of civilisation.\n\n","duration":"","id":168,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_ci3bt2s","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"BBC Sport - Qatar 2022: Sepp Blatter says corruption claims are racist","label":"looeeyeah","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_27ppi8","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.402365064E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.402378998E9,"simScore":0.6990655571280502,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.402379932E9,"simScore":0.6842068816712052,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.402379932E9,"simScore":0.7676903574048952,"sentiment":"  Positive"},"timestamp":1.402380989E9,"simScore":0.7385272926469282,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.402398565E9,"simScore":0.5100719328766399,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":178,"links":[177],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Lordzoot","label":"Agreed.

They have no quality or interest in football at all.\n\n\u0026gt;the heat\n\nRio today is a sweltering 26oC, wow yeah the guy is right that will be hard to play in.\n\nOh wait, Qatar is currently 45oC. Do you not understand how hot this is? It is the desert and football will not be playable in those temperatures; thats why they will have to move the fucking tournament to winter. \n\nThose air conditioned stadiums? Instantly dismissed as impossible after the bid. \n\n\u0026gt; human rights abuses\n\nThe points made here are opinions not fact and are highly concentrated on the USA. Most of them aren\u0027t worth addressing and it just reeks of someone who knows nothing of Qatar/reads /r/politics all day. People are dying building the stadiums, not quite the same as the NSA reading your emails.\n\n\nSo in my conclusion, if you actually read the post it is total shit.

Looking at some of the criticism of the Qatar bid:\n\n**Re: \u0027they\u0027re not a football country\u0027**\n\nThe Qatar World Cup bid (and the purchase of PSG) is part of an effort to essentially protect the country by making it highly identified (and \u0027friendly\u0027) to the western world - we have seen exactly the same method employed by for example the Abu Dhabi Group at City, Roman Abramovich at Chelsea, Usmanov at Arsenal, not to mention others of course who have failed miserably such as Venky\u0027s at Blackburn, or perhaps Carson Yeung at Birmingham.  \n\n(Remains to be seen of course whether the current corruption allegations and spotlight on labour conditions actually harms their original intent - the case was made in a recent podcast, [*One World Sports AET: The FIFA Politics of Soft Power and Scandal*](http://www.beyondthepitch.net/podcasts/edition/index.cfm/one-world-sports-aet/2014/06/03/), that it\u0027s highly probable that it was Western PR agencies who have sold this venture to the Qataris in the first place, promising that they could improve their image and control the Western media spin.)\n\nAnyway when billionaires are using their wealth to fund clubs, many applaud their behaviour as \u0027simply necessary to break into the elite\u0027, or shrug their shoulders, or point out the positive things such investment can bring.  It\u0027s a tangential debate, but nevertheless frames the reasons why Qatar bid in the first place.  \n\nIn theory there\u0027s nothing wrong with what they are trying to do - and of course the same \u0027not a footballing country\u0027 argument could have been made against USA 1994, or Australia 2022.  \n\nIt also fits with the FIFA remit of globalising football, something which has paid off handsomely for other organisations such as the Man United brand, BSkyB, and of course the Premier League itself.\n\n**Re: the bidding process**\n\nIt certainly appears to have been deeply corrupt, however if it wasn\u0027t a Middle Eastern country we might not focus on it so much - the bidding process has likely been very corrupt in most countries for many years.  \n\nI posted yesterday about some of the scandals that occurred in the English approach to their bid, so I won\u0027t bother re-posting it now, suffice to say that the English are hardly above this method of influence in politics themselves - in fact currently helping Qatar in their time of \u0027media spin\u0027 troubles is none other than [former head of the FA David Davies](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football//article4108374.ece).\n\nIn addition the recent Olympics in London was prey to [\u0027gravy train\u0027 behaviour](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football/article4107289.ece), and of course arguably the biggest sporting-event bidding scandal prior to the recent Qatar allegations [actually came out of the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Winter_Olympic_bid_scandal).\n\nI think there is also possibly some misunderstanding about Platini\u0027s involvement.  \n\nPlatini, like Blatter, has based his political power on a platform of inclusion for the \u0027smaller\u0027 countries.  So basically that\u0027s his \u0027campaign promise\u0027, and therefore excludes him from backing, for example, the US.  \n\nThe allegation against him is that French president Sarkozy pressured him into a quid-pro-quo vote for Qatar, in order to push for Qatari investment in France (which of course has happened with PSG, not sure about other sectors).  So basically you have a *French* president pressuring a *French* representative to side with the needs of *French* industry.   Even if the allegations are true, for me this doesn\u0027t really seem like the crime of the century or anything.\n\nThere is also the side issue of the English media vs Platini.  They seem to hate Platini for several reasons, but one of them is FFP - his attempts to curb spending have been met with much criticism, some justified of course.   \n\nHowever I find this a touch hypocritical, since the Qatari investment in the World Cup is, as I attempted to describe above, not really so different to the vast investment we\u0027ve seen in the Premier League, something which the PL and FA have certainly not been shy about courting, and the media have generally been in favour of.\n\nNote I\u0027m not saying that those found guilty of corruption in the Qatar bid shouldn\u0027t be punished, I\u0027m simply trying to point out some double standards in reporting.\n\n\n**Re: the heat**\n\nThis is already an issue in Brazil with a current lawsuit against FIFA by the Brazilian players\u0027 union.  It was also an issue in US 1994.  \n\nFurthermore Qatar\u0027s bid involved air-conditioned stadia which would then be shipped to other countries - so, if actually achieved, their bid could have done a lot of good for other places, rather than creating \u0027white elephants\u0027 as is the case after many sporting events.   \n\nI\u0027m unaware of any other country or bid to have attempted such a project of \u0027transportable\u0027 stadia - although sadly we can probably assume that the subsequent distribution of the stadia would have been subject to just as much corruption.\n\nBut in any case their bid *could* have been painted in the media as a very ambitious engineering project, rather than simple folly.  I haven\u0027t seen the bid videos so I don\u0027t know how convincing it was, but if they could achieve this (including moving the stadia afterwards), I don\u0027t see anything that is inherently terminal about this aspect of the bid.  \n\nThe Brazil bid in this respect is probably worse, since it had no plans to move the stadia (such as the one in Manaus) afterwards.\n\nI wonder how the Qatar bid was perceived in architectural circles, before any allegations of corruption came out?  Would be interesting to know the strictly technical views on the topic, rather than political ones.\n\n\n**Re: human rights abuses**\n\nIf we are to consider the human rights issues in Qatar a reason to bar them from hosting the World Cup, we should hold all countries to the same standard.  \n\nIn that case the US for one should certainly never host a sporting event ever again:  *decades* of illegal wars and interference in sovereign democracies, legalised torture, drone killings of civilians without trial, subjugation of its own citizens via the prison-industrial complex, capital punishment, spying and wire-tapping on a massive scale, abuse of migrant workers, and of course its own \u0027money talks\u0027 attitude towards politics with what amounts to legalised bribery in the form of \u0027lobbying\u0027, \u0027corporate personhood\u0027, \u0027pork\u0027, etc.  \n\nI apologise for bringing the politics into this sub and I realise these are complex issues that I am certainly unqualified to comment on - but we cannot hold one country to a high standard while giving others a pass.\n\nAs for the argument that the labour conditions in Qatar affect the WC stadia directly, which is why it\u0027s relevant while the various transgressions of other countries are not - that\u0027s a fair point I suppose, but in that case issues in Qatar regarding homosexuality and womens\u0027 rights etc should not enter the discussion either.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe all have subconscious biases and particularly towards the unknown.   This is not an accusation of racism btw, it\u0027s simply human nature.   \n\nI\u0027d wager only a very small percentage of the readership here in /r/soccer are from (or familiar) with the Middle East - a part of the world with which the West has essentially been \u0027at war\u0027 for many years now.  \n\n(Obviously the situation is far more complex than that, but the majority readership of this website has lived through a prism of yellow journalism which has framed the issues in this manner for possibly their entire lives).  \n\nSo the Middle East (and by proxy Qatar) is basically \u0027the enemy\u0027, and has been accordingly demonised in the press.  Hence why their World Cup bid has attracted such vitriol from the start, more so than other countries which are possibly equally as guilty of various infringements or abuses.\n\nAlso let\u0027s not forget that it\u0027s the English media leading the charge against the corruption - which is absolutely laudable - but certainly carries its own \u0027back-room politics\u0027 aspect since England not only lost out in their bid but also suffered deep embarassment in the process.\n\nBottom line is I wouldn\u0027t call it racism but I do see some hypocrisy.  \n\nThat\u0027s not to say that these corruption allegations shouldn\u0027t be exposed completely though - FIFA as an organisation seems to exist purely to milk the \u0027gravy train\u0027 and certainly seems in serious need of reform and oversight - although to be honest I\u0027m dubious that any kind of reform will ever happen, when the common man seems to have precious little influence on any political figures or those who control the money, the so-called \u00271%\u0027.   \n\nNevertheless we should be careful not to become the simple \u0027attack dogs\u0027 (or \u0027pitchforks\u0027 I suppose it would be in reddit-speak) without proper background information and historical context.\n\nAt the end of the day, like muppets we\u0027ll just watch the show anyway, the classic \u0027bread and circuses\u0027 method which I suppose has worked since the dawn of civilisation.\n\n","duration":"","id":168,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_ci3bt2s","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"BBC Sport - Qatar 2022: Sepp Blatter says corruption claims are racist","label":"looeeyeah","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_27ppi8","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.402365064E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.402378998E9,"simScore":0.6990655571280502,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.402379932E9,"simScore":0.6842068816712052,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.402379932E9,"simScore":0.7676903574048952,"sentiment":"  Positive"},"timestamp":1.402380989E9,"simScore":0.7385272926469282,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.402398565E9,"simScore":0.5100719328766399,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.402414534E9,"simScore":0.548789810327486,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":180,"links":[176],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Electric_Pegasus","label":"This sub is a fucking joke to be honest.","duration":"","id":180,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_ci3l327","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":176,"links":[175],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"famoos","label":"So a well thought out argument gets less upvotes than a longwinded \"BULLSHIT\" on this sub, while it may not be racism, prejudice is clear...","duration":"","id":176,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_ci3kksn","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":175,"links":[174],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Wotnograpefruit","label":"No, this is not a good response.

It\u0027s a tangential debate, but nevertheless frames the reasons why Qatar bid in the first place.  \n\nIn theory there\u0027s nothing wrong with what they are trying to do - and of course the same \u0027not a footballing country\u0027 argument could have been made against USA 1994, or Australia 2022.  \n\nIt also fits with the FIFA remit of globalising football, something which has paid off handsomely for other organisations such as the Man United brand, BSkyB, and of course the Premier League itself.\n\n**Re: the bidding process**\n\nIt certainly appears to have been deeply corrupt, however if it wasn\u0027t a Middle Eastern country we might not focus on it so much - the bidding process has likely been very corrupt in most countries for many years.  \n\nI posted yesterday about some of the scandals that occurred in the English approach to their bid, so I won\u0027t bother re-posting it now, suffice to say that the English are hardly above this method of influence in politics themselves - in fact currently helping Qatar in their time of \u0027media spin\u0027 troubles is none other than [former head of the FA David Davies](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football//article4108374.ece).\n\nIn addition the recent Olympics in London was prey to [\u0027gravy train\u0027 behaviour](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football/article4107289.ece), and of course arguably the biggest sporting-event bidding scandal prior to the recent Qatar allegations [actually came out of the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Winter_Olympic_bid_scandal).\n\nI think there is also possibly some misunderstanding about Platini\u0027s involvement.  \n\nPlatini, like Blatter, has based his political power on a platform of inclusion for the \u0027smaller\u0027 countries.  So basically that\u0027s his \u0027campaign promise\u0027, and therefore excludes him from backing, for example, the US.  \n\nThe allegation against him is that French president Sarkozy pressured him into a quid-pro-quo vote for Qatar, in order to push for Qatari investment in France (which of course has happened with PSG, not sure about other sectors).  So basically you have a *French* president pressuring a *French* representative to side with the needs of *French* industry.   Even if the allegations are true, for me this doesn\u0027t really seem like the crime of the century or anything.\n\nThere is also the side issue of the English media vs Platini.  They seem to hate Platini for several reasons, but one of them is FFP - his attempts to curb spending have been met with much criticism, some justified of course.   \n\nHowever I find this a touch hypocritical, since the Qatari investment in the World Cup is, as I attempted to describe above, not really so different to the vast investment we\u0027ve seen in the Premier League, something which the PL and FA have certainly not been shy about courting, and the media have generally been in favour of.\n\nNote I\u0027m not saying that those found guilty of corruption in the Qatar bid shouldn\u0027t be punished, I\u0027m simply trying to point out some double standards in reporting.\n\n\n**Re: the heat**\n\nThis is already an issue in Brazil with a current lawsuit against FIFA by the Brazilian players\u0027 union.  It was also an issue in US 1994.  \n\nFurthermore Qatar\u0027s bid involved air-conditioned stadia which would then be shipped to other countries - so, if actually achieved, their bid could have done a lot of good for other places, rather than creating \u0027white elephants\u0027 as is the case after many sporting events.   \n\nI\u0027m unaware of any other country or bid to have attempted such a project of \u0027transportable\u0027 stadia - although sadly we can probably assume that the subsequent distribution of the stadia would have been subject to just as much corruption.\n\nBut in any case their bid *could* have been painted in the media as a very ambitious engineering project, rather than simple folly.  I haven\u0027t seen the bid videos so I don\u0027t know how convincing it was, but if they could achieve this (including moving the stadia afterwards), I don\u0027t see anything that is inherently terminal about this aspect of the bid.  \n\nThe Brazil bid in this respect is probably worse, since it had no plans to move the stadia (such as the one in Manaus) afterwards.\n\nI wonder how the Qatar bid was perceived in architectural circles, before any allegations of corruption came out?  Would be interesting to know the strictly technical views on the topic, rather than political ones.\n\n\n**Re: human rights abuses**\n\nIf we are to consider the human rights issues in Qatar a reason to bar them from hosting the World Cup, we should hold all countries to the same standard.  \n\nIn that case the US for one should certainly never host a sporting event ever again:  *decades* of illegal wars and interference in sovereign democracies, legalised torture, drone killings of civilians without trial, subjugation of its own citizens via the prison-industrial complex, capital punishment, spying and wire-tapping on a massive scale, abuse of migrant workers, and of course its own \u0027money talks\u0027 attitude towards politics with what amounts to legalised bribery in the form of \u0027lobbying\u0027, \u0027corporate personhood\u0027, \u0027pork\u0027, etc.  \n\nI apologise for bringing the politics into this sub and I realise these are complex issues that I am certainly unqualified to comment on - but we cannot hold one country to a high standard while giving others a pass.\n\nAs for the argument that the labour conditions in Qatar affect the WC stadia directly, which is why it\u0027s relevant while the various transgressions of other countries are not - that\u0027s a fair point I suppose, but in that case issues in Qatar regarding homosexuality and womens\u0027 rights etc should not enter the discussion either.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe all have subconscious biases and particularly towards the unknown.   This is not an accusation of racism btw, it\u0027s simply human nature.   \n\nI\u0027d wager only a very small percentage of the readership here in /r/soccer are from (or familiar) with the Middle East - a part of the world with which the West has essentially been \u0027at war\u0027 for many years now.  \n\n(Obviously the situation is far more complex than that, but the majority readership of this website has lived through a prism of yellow journalism which has framed the issues in this manner for possibly their entire lives).  \n\nSo the Middle East (and by proxy Qatar) is basically \u0027the enemy\u0027, and has been accordingly demonised in the press.  Hence why their World Cup bid has attracted such vitriol from the start, more so than other countries which are possibly equally as guilty of various infringements or abuses.\n\nAlso let\u0027s not forget that it\u0027s the English media leading the charge against the corruption - which is absolutely laudable - but certainly carries its own \u0027back-room politics\u0027 aspect since England not only lost out in their bid but also suffered deep embarassment in the process.\n\nBottom line is I wouldn\u0027t call it racism but I do see some hypocrisy.  \n\nThat\u0027s not to say that these corruption allegations shouldn\u0027t be exposed completely though - FIFA as an organisation seems to exist purely to milk the \u0027gravy train\u0027 and certainly seems in serious need of reform and oversight - although to be honest I\u0027m dubious that any kind of reform will ever happen, when the common man seems to have precious little influence on any political figures or those who control the money, the so-called \u00271%\u0027.   \n\nNevertheless we should be careful not to become the simple \u0027attack dogs\u0027 (or \u0027pitchforks\u0027 I suppose it would be in reddit-speak) without proper background information and historical context.\n\nAt the end of the day, like muppets we\u0027ll just watch the show anyway, the classic \u0027bread and circuses\u0027 method which I suppose has worked since the dawn of civilisation.\n\n","duration":"","id":168,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_ci3bt2s","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"BBC Sport - Qatar 2022: Sepp Blatter says corruption claims are racist","label":"looeeyeah","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_27ppi8","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.402365064E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.402378998E9,"simScore":0.6990655571280502,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.402379932E9,"simScore":0.6842068816712052,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.402379932E9,"simScore":0.7676903574048952,"sentiment":"  Positive"},"timestamp":1.402380989E9,"simScore":0.7385272926469282,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.402398565E9,"simScore":0.7922131352317638,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.402399702E9,"simScore":0.7426000064238906,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":182,"links":[180],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"NoobJu","label":"Heres an upvote to help you stay alive","duration":"","id":182,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_ci3q022","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":180,"links":[176],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Electric_Pegasus","label":"This sub is a fucking joke to be honest.","duration":"","id":180,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_ci3l327","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":176,"links":[175],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"famoos","label":"So a well thought out argument gets less upvotes than a longwinded \"BULLSHIT\" on this sub, while it may not be racism, prejudice is clear...","duration":"","id":176,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_ci3kksn","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":175,"links":[174],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Wotnograpefruit","label":"No, this is not a good response.

Even if the allegations are true, for me this doesn\u0027t really seem like the crime of the century or anything.\n\nThere is also the side issue of the English media vs Platini.  They seem to hate Platini for several reasons, but one of them is FFP - his attempts to curb spending have been met with much criticism, some justified of course.   \n\nHowever I find this a touch hypocritical, since the Qatari investment in the World Cup is, as I attempted to describe above, not really so different to the vast investment we\u0027ve seen in the Premier League, something which the PL and FA have certainly not been shy about courting, and the media have generally been in favour of.\n\nNote I\u0027m not saying that those found guilty of corruption in the Qatar bid shouldn\u0027t be punished, I\u0027m simply trying to point out some double standards in reporting.\n\n\n**Re: the heat**\n\nThis is already an issue in Brazil with a current lawsuit against FIFA by the Brazilian players\u0027 union.  It was also an issue in US 1994.  \n\nFurthermore Qatar\u0027s bid involved air-conditioned stadia which would then be shipped to other countries - so, if actually achieved, their bid could have done a lot of good for other places, rather than creating \u0027white elephants\u0027 as is the case after many sporting events.   \n\nI\u0027m unaware of any other country or bid to have attempted such a project of \u0027transportable\u0027 stadia - although sadly we can probably assume that the subsequent distribution of the stadia would have been subject to just as much corruption.\n\nBut in any case their bid *could* have been painted in the media as a very ambitious engineering project, rather than simple folly.  I haven\u0027t seen the bid videos so I don\u0027t know how convincing it was, but if they could achieve this (including moving the stadia afterwards), I don\u0027t see anything that is inherently terminal about this aspect of the bid.  \n\nThe Brazil bid in this respect is probably worse, since it had no plans to move the stadia (such as the one in Manaus) afterwards.\n\nI wonder how the Qatar bid was perceived in architectural circles, before any allegations of corruption came out?  Would be interesting to know the strictly technical views on the topic, rather than political ones.\n\n\n**Re: human rights abuses**\n\nIf we are to consider the human rights issues in Qatar a reason to bar them from hosting the World Cup, we should hold all countries to the same standard.  \n\nIn that case the US for one should certainly never host a sporting event ever again:  *decades* of illegal wars and interference in sovereign democracies, legalised torture, drone killings of civilians without trial, subjugation of its own citizens via the prison-industrial complex, capital punishment, spying and wire-tapping on a massive scale, abuse of migrant workers, and of course its own \u0027money talks\u0027 attitude towards politics with what amounts to legalised bribery in the form of \u0027lobbying\u0027, \u0027corporate personhood\u0027, \u0027pork\u0027, etc.  \n\nI apologise for bringing the politics into this sub and I realise these are complex issues that I am certainly unqualified to comment on - but we cannot hold one country to a high standard while giving others a pass.\n\nAs for the argument that the labour conditions in Qatar affect the WC stadia directly, which is why it\u0027s relevant while the various transgressions of other countries are not - that\u0027s a fair point I suppose, but in that case issues in Qatar regarding homosexuality and womens\u0027 rights etc should not enter the discussion either.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe all have subconscious biases and particularly towards the unknown.   This is not an accusation of racism btw, it\u0027s simply human nature.   \n\nI\u0027d wager only a very small percentage of the readership here in /r/soccer are from (or familiar) with the Middle East - a part of the world with which the West has essentially been \u0027at war\u0027 for many years now.  \n\n(Obviously the situation is far more complex than that, but the majority readership of this website has lived through a prism of yellow journalism which has framed the issues in this manner for possibly their entire lives).  \n\nSo the Middle East (and by proxy Qatar) is basically \u0027the enemy\u0027, and has been accordingly demonised in the press.  Hence why their World Cup bid has attracted such vitriol from the start, more so than other countries which are possibly equally as guilty of various infringements or abuses.\n\nAlso let\u0027s not forget that it\u0027s the English media leading the charge against the corruption - which is absolutely laudable - but certainly carries its own \u0027back-room politics\u0027 aspect since England not only lost out in their bid but also suffered deep embarassment in the process.\n\nBottom line is I wouldn\u0027t call it racism but I do see some hypocrisy.  \n\nThat\u0027s not to say that these corruption allegations shouldn\u0027t be exposed completely though - FIFA as an organisation seems to exist purely to milk the \u0027gravy train\u0027 and certainly seems in serious need of reform and oversight - although to be honest I\u0027m dubious that any kind of reform will ever happen, when the common man seems to have precious little influence on any political figures or those who control the money, the so-called \u00271%\u0027.   \n\nNevertheless we should be careful not to become the simple \u0027attack dogs\u0027 (or \u0027pitchforks\u0027 I suppose it would be in reddit-speak) without proper background information and historical context.\n\nAt the end of the day, like muppets we\u0027ll just watch the show anyway, the classic \u0027bread and circuses\u0027 method which I suppose has worked since the dawn of civilisation.\n\n","duration":"","id":168,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_ci3bt2s","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"BBC Sport - Qatar 2022: Sepp Blatter says corruption claims are racist","label":"looeeyeah","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_27ppi8","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.402365064E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.402378998E9,"simScore":0.6990655571280502,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.402379932E9,"simScore":0.6842068816712052,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.402379932E9,"simScore":0.7676903574048952,"sentiment":"  Positive"},"timestamp":1.402380989E9,"simScore":0.7385272926469282,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.402398565E9,"simScore":0.7922131352317638,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.402399702E9,"simScore":0.6952083272238572,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.402415558E9,"simScore":0.7596666514873505,"sentiment":"  Positive"},{"index":184,"links":[175],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"DubaiCM","label":"\u0026gt; Citing climate issues with other host countries is bullshit, as Qatar has significantly higher temperatures than anywhere in the USA or Brazil. \n\nNevertheless, stadiums can be air-conditioned so I don\u0027t see this as an issue.\n\n\u0026gt; It\u0027s also a ludicrously tiny country lacking in infrastructure to host the number of visitors expected. \n\nAgain, this is not really an issue, as Qatar has eight years to address this.

It\u0027s a tangential debate, but nevertheless frames the reasons why Qatar bid in the first place.  \n\nIn theory there\u0027s nothing wrong with what they are trying to do - and of course the same \u0027not a footballing country\u0027 argument could have been made against USA 1994, or Australia 2022.  \n\nIt also fits with the FIFA remit of globalising football, something which has paid off handsomely for other organisations such as the Man United brand, BSkyB, and of course the Premier League itself.\n\n**Re: the bidding process**\n\nIt certainly appears to have been deeply corrupt, however if it wasn\u0027t a Middle Eastern country we might not focus on it so much - the bidding process has likely been very corrupt in most countries for many years.  \n\nI posted yesterday about some of the scandals that occurred in the English approach to their bid, so I won\u0027t bother re-posting it now, suffice to say that the English are hardly above this method of influence in politics themselves - in fact currently helping Qatar in their time of \u0027media spin\u0027 troubles is none other than [former head of the FA David Davies](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football//article4108374.ece).\n\nIn addition the recent Olympics in London was prey to [\u0027gravy train\u0027 behaviour](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football/article4107289.ece), and of course arguably the biggest sporting-event bidding scandal prior to the recent Qatar allegations [actually came out of the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Winter_Olympic_bid_scandal).\n\nI think there is also possibly some misunderstanding about Platini\u0027s involvement.  \n\nPlatini, like Blatter, has based his political power on a platform of inclusion for the \u0027smaller\u0027 countries.

Looking at some of the criticism of the Qatar bid:\n\n**Re: \u0027they\u0027re not a football country\u0027**\n\nThe Qatar World Cup bid (and the purchase of PSG) is part of an effort to essentially protect the country by making it highly identified (and \u0027friendly\u0027) to the western world - we have seen exactly the same method employed by for example the Abu Dhabi Group at City, Roman Abramovich at Chelsea, Usmanov at Arsenal, not to mention others of course who have failed miserably such as Venky\u0027s at Blackburn, or perhaps Carson Yeung at Birmingham.  \n\n(Remains to be seen of course whether the current corruption allegations and spotlight on labour conditions actually harms their original intent - the case was made in a recent podcast, [*One World Sports AET: The FIFA Politics of Soft Power and Scandal*](http://www.beyondthepitch.net/podcasts/edition/index.cfm/one-world-sports-aet/2014/06/03/), that it\u0027s highly probable that it was Western PR agencies who have sold this venture to the Qataris in the first place, promising that they could improve their image and control the Western media spin.)\n\nAnyway when billionaires are using their wealth to fund clubs, many applaud their behaviour as \u0027simply necessary to break into the elite\u0027, or shrug their shoulders, or point out the positive things such investment can bring.  It\u0027s a tangential debate, but nevertheless frames the reasons why Qatar bid in the first place.  \n\nIn theory there\u0027s nothing wrong with what they are trying to do - and of course the same \u0027not a footballing country\u0027 argument could have been made against USA 1994, or Australia 2022.  \n\nIt also fits with the FIFA remit of globalising football, something which has paid off handsomely for other organisations such as the Man United brand, BSkyB, and of course the Premier League itself.\n\n**Re: the bidding process**\n\nIt certainly appears to have been deeply corrupt, however if it wasn\u0027t a Middle Eastern country we might not focus on it so much - the bidding process has likely been very corrupt in most countries for many years.  \n\nI posted yesterday about some of the scandals that occurred in the English approach to their bid, so I won\u0027t bother re-posting it now, suffice to say that the English are hardly above this method of influence in politics themselves - in fact currently helping Qatar in their time of \u0027media spin\u0027 troubles is none other than [former head of the FA David Davies](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football//article4108374.ece).\n\nIn addition the recent Olympics in London was prey to [\u0027gravy train\u0027 behaviour](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football/article4107289.ece), and of course arguably the biggest sporting-event bidding scandal prior to the recent Qatar allegations [actually came out of the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Winter_Olympic_bid_scandal).\n\nI think there is also possibly some misunderstanding about Platini\u0027s involvement.  \n\nPlatini, like Blatter, has based his political power on a platform of inclusion for the \u0027smaller\u0027 countries.  So basically that\u0027s his \u0027campaign promise\u0027, and therefore excludes him from backing, for example, the US.  \n\nThe allegation against him is that French president Sarkozy pressured him into a quid-pro-quo vote for Qatar, in order to push for Qatari investment in France (which of course has happened with PSG, not sure about other sectors).  So basically you have a *French* president pressuring a *French* representative to side with the needs of *French* industry.   Even if the allegations are true, for me this doesn\u0027t really seem like the crime of the century or anything.\n\nThere is also the side issue of the English media vs Platini.  They seem to hate Platini for several reasons, but one of them is FFP - his attempts to curb spending have been met with much criticism, some justified of course.   \n\nHowever I find this a touch hypocritical, since the Qatari investment in the World Cup is, as I attempted to describe above, not really so different to the vast investment we\u0027ve seen in the Premier League, something which the PL and FA have certainly not been shy about courting, and the media have generally been in favour of.\n\nNote I\u0027m not saying that those found guilty of corruption in the Qatar bid shouldn\u0027t be punished, I\u0027m simply trying to point out some double standards in reporting.\n\n\n**Re: the heat**\n\nThis is already an issue in Brazil with a current lawsuit against FIFA by the Brazilian players\u0027 union.

Looking at some of the criticism of the Qatar bid:\n\n**Re: \u0027they\u0027re not a football country\u0027**\n\nThe Qatar World Cup bid (and the purchase of PSG) is part of an effort to essentially protect the country by making it highly identified (and \u0027friendly\u0027) to the western world - we have seen exactly the same method employed by for example the Abu Dhabi Group at City, Roman Abramovich at Chelsea, Usmanov at Arsenal, not to mention others of course who have failed miserably such as Venky\u0027s at Blackburn, or perhaps Carson Yeung at Birmingham.  \n\n(Remains to be seen of course whether the current corruption allegations and spotlight on labour conditions actually harms their original intent - the case was made in a recent podcast, [*One World Sports AET: The FIFA Politics of Soft Power and Scandal*](http://www.beyondthepitch.net/podcasts/edition/index.cfm/one-world-sports-aet/2014/06/03/), that it\u0027s highly probable that it was Western PR agencies who have sold this venture to the Qataris in the first place, promising that they could improve their image and control the Western media spin.)\n\nAnyway when billionaires are using their wealth to fund clubs, many applaud their behaviour as \u0027simply necessary to break into the elite\u0027, or shrug their shoulders, or point out the positive things such investment can bring.  It\u0027s a tangential debate, but nevertheless frames the reasons why Qatar bid in the first place.  \n\nIn theory there\u0027s nothing wrong with what they are trying to do - and of course the same \u0027not a footballing country\u0027 argument could have been made against USA 1994, or Australia 2022.  \n\nIt also fits with the FIFA remit of globalising football, something which has paid off handsomely for other organisations such as the Man United brand, BSkyB, and of course the Premier League itself.\n\n**Re: the bidding process**\n\nIt certainly appears to have been deeply corrupt, however if it wasn\u0027t a Middle Eastern country we might not focus on it so much - the bidding process has likely been very corrupt in most countries for many years.  \n\nI posted yesterday about some of the scandals that occurred in the English approach to their bid, so I won\u0027t bother re-posting it now, suffice to say that the English are hardly above this method of influence in politics themselves - in fact currently helping Qatar in their time of \u0027media spin\u0027 troubles is none other than [former head of the FA David Davies](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football//article4108374.ece).\n\nIn addition the recent Olympics in London was prey to [\u0027gravy train\u0027 behaviour](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football/article4107289.ece), and of course arguably the biggest sporting-event bidding scandal prior to the recent Qatar allegations [actually came out of the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Winter_Olympic_bid_scandal).\n\nI think there is also possibly some misunderstanding about Platini\u0027s involvement.  \n\nPlatini, like Blatter, has based his political power on a platform of inclusion for the \u0027smaller\u0027 countries.  So basically that\u0027s his \u0027campaign promise\u0027, and therefore excludes him from backing, for example, the US.  \n\nThe allegation against him is that French president Sarkozy pressured him into a quid-pro-quo vote for Qatar, in order to push for Qatari investment in France (which of course has happened with PSG, not sure about other sectors).  So basically you have a *French* president pressuring a *French* representative to side with the needs of *French* industry.   Even if the allegations are true, for me this doesn\u0027t really seem like the crime of the century or anything.\n\nThere is also the side issue of the English media vs Platini.  They seem to hate Platini for several reasons, but one of them is FFP - his attempts to curb spending have been met with much criticism, some justified of course.   \n\nHowever I find this a touch hypocritical, since the Qatari investment in the World Cup is, as I attempted to describe above, not really so different to the vast investment we\u0027ve seen in the Premier League, something which the PL and FA have certainly not been shy about courting, and the media have generally been in favour of.\n\nNote I\u0027m not saying that those found guilty of corruption in the Qatar bid shouldn\u0027t be punished, I\u0027m simply trying to point out some double standards in reporting.\n\n\n**Re: the heat**\n\nThis is already an issue in Brazil with a current lawsuit against FIFA by the Brazilian players\u0027 union.  It was also an issue in US 1994.  \n\nFurthermore Qatar\u0027s bid involved air-conditioned stadia which would then be shipped to other countries - so, if actually achieved, their bid could have done a lot of good for other places, rather than creating \u0027white elephants\u0027 as is the case after many sporting events.   \n\nI\u0027m unaware of any other country or bid to have attempted such a project of \u0027transportable\u0027 stadia - although sadly we can probably assume that the subsequent distribution of the stadia would have been subject to just as much corruption.\n\nBut in any case their bid *could* have been painted in the media as a very ambitious engineering project, rather than simple folly.

Hence why their World Cup bid has attracted such vitriol from the start, more so than other countries which are possibly equally as guilty of various infringements or abuses.\n\nAlso let\u0027s not forget that it\u0027s the English media leading the charge against the corruption - which is absolutely laudable - but certainly carries its own \u0027back-room politics\u0027 aspect since England not only lost out in their bid but also suffered deep embarassment in the process.\n\nBottom line is I wouldn\u0027t call it racism but I do see some hypocrisy.  \n\nThat\u0027s not to say that these corruption allegations shouldn\u0027t be exposed completely though - FIFA as an organisation seems to exist purely to milk the \u0027gravy train\u0027 and certainly seems in serious need of reform and oversight - although to be honest I\u0027m dubious that any kind of reform will ever happen, when the common man seems to have precious little influence on any political figures or those who control the money, the so-called \u00271%\u0027.   \n\nNevertheless we should be careful not to become the simple \u0027attack dogs\u0027 (or \u0027pitchforks\u0027 I suppose it would be in reddit-speak) without proper background information and historical context.\n\nAt the end of the day, like muppets we\u0027ll just watch the show anyway, the classic \u0027bread and circuses\u0027 method which I suppose has worked since the dawn of civilisation.\n\n","duration":"","id":168,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_ci3bt2s","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"BBC Sport - Qatar 2022: Sepp Blatter says corruption claims are racist","label":"looeeyeah","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_27ppi8","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.402365064E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.402378998E9,"simScore":0.6990655571280502,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.402393253E9,"simScore":0.6661491680184509,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":190,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"youngloversgopop","label":"Fuck off sepp you senile old cunt","duration":"","id":190,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_ci37scm","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"BBC Sport - Qatar 2022: Sepp Blatter says corruption claims are racist","label":"looeeyeah","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_27ppi8","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.402365064E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.402371006E9,"simScore":0.736099997907877,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":191,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"grindmystump","label":"Ach well pal, nothing a handshake can\u0027t fix eh?
