It is worth reporting on. Planned Parenthood\u0027s sphere of coverage and resources are pathetic. Pathetic because we should not have a private company providing vital services to so many people. Pathetic because we\u0027ve allowed women\u0027s health care and family planning providers to be driven out of so many places in the US. Pathetic because we, collectively, allow so much suffering and pain to occur. This is worth reporting on because it shows how far beyond the pale we are. Planned Parenthood is, for all practical intents and purposes, the last bastion of anything resembling reproductive freedom in this country. If they\u0027re gone then that\u0027s it. We\u0027re fucked, and we\u0027re going to get knocked up because of it. They\u0027re the most visible organization in the fight for reproductive rights. We should be fighting to extend their funding. We should be, and I\u0027m sure many people are, fighting to take back our resources from the warmongering DoD and entrust it to organizations like PP and Acorn and NPR and CPB and all the other wonderful, effective organizations that put the majority of private for profit organizations to shame.

I mean, it\u0027s clear that the job market wouldn\u0027t be able to take the WHOLE population with degrees for something or something other; it\u0027s just the way things are. In my country for instance, the medical colegiums work with the ministry of education to determine each year how many spots for medical school they should open, taking into consideration the need for doctors. If they opened up too many, there would be doctors without jobs, and if they opened too few, there would be a lack of them. It\u0027s the same with almost every other career, and I\u0027m sure Mexico does roughly the same thing. \n\n\u0026gt; The public health care system sucks, but it is better than the US in general.\n\nYeah, well, that\u0027s what I meant, they don\u0027t have last-generation MRI\u0027s or anything, but they have doctors that\u0027ll actually look at you when you have problems.  People may die of brain stem tumours because they may not have neutron particle acelerators to treat them, but people don\u0027t die in the streets from a heart attack for fear of ending up bankrupt when they call an ambulance. That\u0027s what I meant.\n\n\u0026gt; The reason I moved here is because even though my tax money often goes to stuff I disagree with here in Mexico none of it goes to endless war against the poor in foreign countries nor to WMDs.\n\nI can totally get behind that. And what\u0027s more, I am sure that this narc crap with have to end at some point (hopefully soon), and when it does, Mexico will be catapulted to an era of unprecedented progress. I just hope the population gets ever more educated, I don\u0027t know how long you\u0027ve lived there, but in 2006 they were pretty damn close to electing for president a guy who makes Chavez look like a moderate conservative. And of course everyone seems to hate Calderon as of late despite the fact that he\u0027s been doing an impeccable job for the country (at least from an outsider\u0027s PoV), and that the alternatives (for the 2012 run) are going to be mostly people with deep ties to the narcs.
