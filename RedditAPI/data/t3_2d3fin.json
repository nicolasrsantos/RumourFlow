Obama is just hugely foreign to them, and a lot of Americans who grew up before you.   \n\nAnd it isn\u0027t totally a race thing, though in playing for sympathy (look at Obama\u0027s historically inaccurate self serving  speech in Selma, Alabama) Obama has invited that as a salient component of being an other.   \n\n\nIt\u0027s a mindset thing, a worldview.   \n\nSomeone who grew up with a foreign national father, in Indonesia or off the continental US for their developing years, can say the Adhan (Muslim morning call to prayer) went to school as a young man in Manhattan and then Cambridge surrounded by left and far left political agreement **isn\u0027t** inherently a bad person.  \n\nBut they are essentially quite foreign to a pretty big chunk of mainstream, historical America.   \n\nAnd when he says stuff that sounds kind of patronizing, or clueless (and he totally does), it makes it all the more easier to just not like the guy.       \n\nAsk your parents - and tell them your conservative internet buddy suggested it- to talk to you about how they thought of Kerry vs Bush in 2004.   \n\nI was 14 then, and I remember myself thinking \"who the Fuck is this guy who speaks French and has a yacht married to the heiress of the Heinz ketchup fortune think he is to be the president of America\"\n\nAnd this is as a racial/religious minority/vegetarian/yoga doing non-traditional American myself.   \n\nI\u0027m totally serious, ask your parents how they felt about Kerry compared to Bush in 04.  \n\nYou\u0027ll see their lips curl and their brows furrow - especially since he\u0027s still around, though he didn\u0027t win.        \n\n\n ","duration":"","id":56,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_cjltzip","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":55,"links":[54],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"multiplyinghorsey","label":"They definitely aren\u0027t stupid; I just dislike how they approach politics.

Even more-so than Bush Jr. (and I never thought I\u0027d say that until about 2 years in to Obama\u0027s first term).\n\nHe\u0027s signed massive amounts of executive orders, he\u0027s proceeded with bombings without Congressional approval (yes, I know that that bullshit law that Nixon signed in allows him to do so; doesn\u0027t make it Constitutional), he passed a completely Unconstitutional ACA, and he\u0027s *massively* expanded the spying programs.\n\nHe\u0027s done very few positive things, as well, unfortunately. More green energy has been brought in to the country, but that\u0027s hardly due to his influence, that\u0027s just the market, really. In addition, we have more overall energy independence than under the Bush administration, due to the increase in green energy, and the increase in mining for shale oil in the mainland U.S. Besides that, I can\u0027t really think of anything off the top of my head\n\nHe\u0027s also refused to keep the **vast** majority of his campaign promises. He promised to end the spying programs, he promised to pull *completely* out of the Middle East by the end of his first term, I believe it was, he promised to end corporate tax loopholes, he promised to end income tax for Seniors earning 50k or less, he promised to focus 60 *billion* extra dollars on roads and bridges, and he promised to allow Medicare to negotiate for better prices on drugs (amongst a *massive* amount of other things). He\u0027s done none of these in the 5+ years he\u0027s been president. And don\u0027t blame that on an \"incompetent Congress\" either. No matter how incompetent they are, they still manage to pass the bills that work *against* the American people, such as renewing the NDAA and PATRIOT Act, they can work together to get these things done too. All they need is the motivation and the push.\n\nDon\u0027t get me wrong, Fox News\u0027 bullshit about him being a terrorist, and a \"secret Muslim\" is all crap.
