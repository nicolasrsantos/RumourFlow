Money, my friend, is why they are so hungry to take down FIFA. It IS corrupt, but never believe that\u0027s why we\u0027re doing it -that\u0027s just the justification to garner public support. In the end, FIFA will fall and that\u0027s good.

This impacts all the major sports across the world.\n\nIn the US it\u0027s the NBA, NHL, NFL. In Europe many large soccer associations will be impacted.\n\nThis probably got a lot of the organizations pissed, they then asked around to see what can be done. \n\nTo me it\u0027s too coincidental, suddenly people all over Europe started to publicly distance themselves from FIFA. I mean even Prince William questioned FIFA, and he didnt just make a comment at some event, no, he made a whole speech just for FIFA.\n\nThe US would NOT have gone after FIFA if it did not have the cooperation of Europe. So my guess is they got together and put a plan in place very recently to see if they can make Qatar not happen.\n","duration":"","id":344,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_crtubt3","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"US Officials announce Sepp Blatter under investigation for corruption","label":"mutant86","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_389uo3","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.433307003E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.433335436E9,"simScore":0.7111672871256133,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.433348835E9,"simScore":0.5185841366686952,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":346,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"simohayha","label":"Get fucked Blatter","duration":"","id":346,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_crttnak","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"US Officials announce Sepp Blatter under investigation for corruption","label":"mutant86","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_389uo3","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.433307003E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.433333832E9,"simScore":0.6610714300047784,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},{"index":347,"links":[346],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"anosognosia","label":"I said that already when he defeated Johansson back in 1998 by buying african votes.
