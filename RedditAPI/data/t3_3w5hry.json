The town was pretty much dead, and just a few shops running, and a DVD store(!!!) and the rest were farmers. So this guy interviews the townsfolk.\n\nOver and over again they said that Trump was going to change things.

None of this is true for all the other republican nominees. Only two people had reservations, and that was because he\u0027s an atheist.

This doesn\u0027t apply in Europe because Europeans view Asians and Africans as the same backwards people, but in the US, Persians and Turks just coast by while darker Muslims get all the shit. I have the Persian fuccboiz in LA to thank for my good reputation here, they\u0027ve done a good job convincing you us Persians are all non-Muslims when that obviously isn\u0027t the case. So when I tell people I\u0027m a Persian muslim they somehow think I\u0027m better than Arab or paki muslims even though we share the same beliefs, I just have a lighter skin tone. \n\n\nWhite Turkish and Persian women in headscarves won\u0027t nearly get the same amount of shit as Arab, Paki, African, and Indian Muslims. This is a fact. A fact that has been building resentment in the Turkish and Persian Muslim communities for a while I might add. Yes, discrimination against religion is classified as bigotry, not racism. But in this case. Racism has a massive role in it. \n\n\nHell, Christian Pakis get more shit than me.

It\u0027s almost exactly what Reagan did, in the same kind of political climate. People wanted something different, and Reagan came in and threw a ton of easy one-liners around that people could get behind without thinking about it. His \"Nine most dangerous words\" statement is iconic as much as it\u0027s moronic, and it\u0027s exactly what we are getting from Trump now.\n\nTrump realized a celebrity candidate could have a real chance post-Obama. Several factors came together in his favor:\n\n- Obama was the big shake-up from within the political world, a young passionate guy who walked his own line. Unfortunately, he walked the standard line once in office, and most people are left wanting more (not necessarily from their President but from their Federal Government). People want a shake-up, but they are hesitant to take career politicians from inside either party to do so.\n- The Democrats do not have a strong candidate to follow up Obama. Clinton is the Blue Romney, the default, but she isn\u0027t strong. Sanders is going to come up short on broad appeal. Sadly I think O\u0027Malley would do well in a GE, but he has no chance of getting there. \n- Republicans fielded garbage in 2012. Jeb Bush, the one potential shining light, has shown himself to be a poor orator here in 2015. Rubio and Cruz have baggage that make them liabilities in the GE. Rand is never going to get the party nomination. Carson was a dark horse, but he\u0027s essentially come and gone. \n- Anti-Islamic and anti-immigration rhetoric is more tolerated than ever in the current international climate. This is a real benefit for a guy like Trump, who can say almost anything he wants as long as people believe he is going to make tangible fixes to what voters perceive as chronic issues. \n- People have zero trust in politicians to correct economic issues post-2008. Most people still believe we are in the throes of depression/recession, and they (rightly) believe that Congress has done jack-shit to solve the problem. The idea of a successful business mogul coming in to right the ship is more reasonable than ever.\n\nTrump is a smart bastard.","duration":"","id":501,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_cxuay5v","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":499,"links":[498],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"mama35","label":"This is my theory too.
