The Islamic State in particular adheres to a radically fundamentalist Sunni branch of it. They are more true to what\u0027s written in the Koran than almost any other followers of the faith.\n\n[This excellent article](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/) in The Atlantic describes it perfectly.\n\n\u0026gt;The reality is that the Islamic State is Islamic. Very Islamic. Yes, it has attracted psychopaths and adventure seekers, drawn largely from the disaffected populations of the Middle East and Europe. But the religion preached by its most ardent followers derives from coherent and even learned interpretations of Islam.\n\n\u0026gt;Virtually every major decision and law promulgated by the Islamic State adheres to what it calls, in its press and pronouncements, and on its billboards, license plates, stationery, and coins, “the Prophetic methodology,” which means following the prophecy and example of Muhammad, in punctilious detail. Muslims can reject the Islamic State; nearly all do. But pretending that it isn’t actually a religious, millenarian group, with theology that must be understood to be combatted, has already led the United States to underestimate it and back foolish schemes to counter it. We’ll need to get acquainted with the Islamic State’s intellectual genealogy if we are to react in a way that will not strengthen it, but instead help it self-immolate in its own excessive zeal.\n\nThe leaders of the Islamic State believe they are following the laws and prophecies of Mohammed and the Koran to the letter. They\u0027re not fighting for oil or other geopolitical concerns. They\u0027re not negotiating for land concessions or recognition from the U.N. as rebel groups in other conflicts are, such as in Ukraine. They believe the caliphate they have created was commanded of them by God to lead to an apocalypse where the infidels are ultimately defeated.\n\nThey are every bit as religious as the fundamentalist Jews who create settlements on what the believe is sacred land.\n\nTo them, the \"real\" muslims you celebrate are apostates. And, if you followed what\u0027s written in the Koran, you\u0027d have concede they are faithful to it.\n\n","duration":"","id":398,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_coxoz2n","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":394,"links":[393],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"seancolorado","label":"I agree it is disturbing.

How many of these people exist, have they succeeded in taking down organizations from the inside... I don\u0027t know. But, there are people who have come out and talked about this phenomenon, so to out Obama has done those things as reason that he isn\u0027t Islam doesn\u0027t help the cause. And there are extremist groups who hated al-Qaeda and would have been happy to kill Osama if they had the chance. \n\nDo I believe Obama is some sleeper cell extremist taking down America from the inside? No. I think there is more of a chance he is a communist trying to take down capitalism. But it\u0027s certainly possible he is an islamist sleeper cell, they exist.

The news starts showing clips of young Republican women with perfect hair and pearls with mascara running down their cheeks in their great despair. An old woman in Arkansas has a heart attack from the shock. Groups of young, Confederate flag-yielding men in Georgia have taken to the streets, looting businesses and vandalizing homes of black families. Fox News begins a montage memorial program, commemorating what America used to be. Rush Limbaugh dies from a stroke. \n\nThe viewers on their couches have gotten so worked up at this point, they struggle to breath. Their TV dinners thrown to the side long ago in their rage, forgotten. Mac and cheese seeps into the carpet, staining grandma\u0027s nice rug. All of a sudden, **POP!!!** **POP POP POP!!** Small explosions are heard all over small rural towns and wealthy Republican suburbs. They\u0027re exploding!! The Conservatives are *literally* exploding in their anger! People start panicking, turning off their TVs in hopes to save themselves from their own rage-fueled combustion, but it\u0027s too late. They\u0027ll never be able to save America from the gays and the trannys and the coloreds now. **POP POP POP!** \n\nEdit: Thank you kind sir or madam, for this gift you have bestowed upon me!","duration":"","id":657,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cox51yr","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":656,"links":[655],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Felinomancy","label":"Good grief, if people get upset because the President belongs to the wrong kind of Christianity... \n\nI would support a transgendered gay atheist President just to see certain segments of the population explode.","duration":"","id":656,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_cowyrml","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":655,"links":[654],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"antihexe","label":"Actually yes.

I just want to know all the sides, and nobody in my visible comments actually mentioned a poll except you. Not everyone is here for the circlejerk.   \n\nhttp://www.gallup.com/poll/155315/many-americans-cant-name-obamas-religion.aspx\n\nIt does say 18% of republicans think Obama is Muslim, compared to 24% that think he is Christian. This poll was done in 2012, before Isis and the recent extremist aggression, and the news channels\u0027 polarizing coverage thereof. Only a 1/4 of Republicans even got right that he was a /some Christian denomination. It only proves that people don\u0027t know his religion, a finding bolstered by this last poll. I think it\u0027s totally possible that both polls are correct, and do not refute each other. Or, maybe this latest one is bullshit. Not like it should matter what people \"think\" his religion actually is anyway. At least now I have more information.
