review of \u0027United Passions\u0027.","subreddit":"soccer","subredditId":"t5_2qi58","thumbnail":"","selftext":"Why was this film made? When I was watching United Passions, and in the hours and days and now weeks after watching it, I still haven\u0027t come to any real conclusion that would satisfy me.\n\nLet\u0027s rewind a bit. Some of you who know me a little better may be asking how I saw this movie when I live in the UK. Well, I ordered the movie off the French version of Amazon and I had it delivered to my house. This meant that I had to watch the film in English with French subtitles, but it wasn\u0027t really a problem. The only bit where there were no English subtitles was during one of the football matches where a (Brazilian?) commentator was commentating, and I had to follow the French subtitles. I understood 90% of those, so it wasn\u0027t really a problem.\n\nThere are so many problems with this movie, it would be best if I just went through in a rough chronological order to show them, and expanding on thematic problems when I come across them. I\u0027ll divide the review into sections too, with quotes from the film.\n\nAlso, if you even care, there are spoilers in this review.\n\n**\"What do the foreigners understand of our beautiful game?\"**\n\nThe first thing that made me laugh was that this film was an official selection at Cannes. It\u0027s come to light recently that this was at [Depardieu\u0027s insistence](http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/16/depardieu-insisted-show-fifa-film-united-passions-cannes-head), which explains a lot. The second thing that made me laugh was this quote:\n\n\"While this story is inspired by actual events and real people, certain characters portrayed, characterizations, scenes and dialogue spoken represent a work of dramatic fiction.\"\n\nThis is basically FIFA admitting that what you are about to watch is mostly made up. If this film was supposed to be an accurate history of FIFA, this disclaimer would be much shorter. When the film opens, we see a group of kids meeting up to play football on a dusty pitch. A girl jumps off a bench to join them while the locals watch on. This clichéd device appears several times in this movie, sometimes at random intervals, and it is so obvious that FIFA are shamelessly using this in an attempt to show how \u0027diverse\u0027 they are. The plot running through this device makes no sense either; throughout the film, we see that the girl is the goalkeeper, but she misses every save that she makes. In the end of the film, not only does she make a save, but she beats every other player on the pitch to score at the other end of the field. Not only is this unrealistic, considering her apparent skill level, it is laughable. It is also really condescending to women\u0027s football.\n\nI haven\u0027t even got into the film proper yet. A letter is written by Hirschman (the eventual 2nd General Secretary of FIFA) about the need for a united organisation. We cut to a football match being played in England, with many English folk appearing in top hats, and a \u0027toff\u0027 with a monocle - who is also the president of the English FA - stands up to disparage a player. The quote for this section comes from him. This theme of \u0027bashing England\u0027 and \u0027unpleasant Englishmen\u0027 is one of the few consistent themes in the movie, and it happens to pretty much every English character. Not one opportunity is wasted, as one of the FA derides the people attempting to set up FIFA in such a heavy handed way, you\u0027d almost think that he was a pantomime villain. I kid you not, this is the transcript of a scene later on in the movie, with an English person, Jules Rimet and Jules Rimet\u0027s daughter before the 1st World Cup:\n\n\u0026gt;English Guy - \"May I say young lady that all this makes absolutely no moral sense. What\u0027s the use in organising the World Cup in the Americas in a country no-one\u0027s heard of, which is a stranger to modernity. And why not at the tip of Africa with the Zulus while we\u0027re at it?\"\n\n\u0026gt;Jules Rimet\u0027s Daughter - \"Why not indeed? Who knows, the Zulus may be excellent football players; maybe they just don\u0027t know it yet.\"\n\n\u0026gt;E - \"But young lady, the natives of Africa are stupid and undisciplined, it\u0027s just their nature. How could they possibly be expected to appreciate the subtleties of the game invented by the whites?\"\n\n\u0026gt;Jules Rimet - (Entering) \"Ah my girl, are you having a pleasant evening?\"\n\n\u0026gt;E - \"Ah, Monsieur Rimet, this young person is your daughter?\"\n\n\u0026gt;JR - \"Indeed she is.\"\n\n\u0026gt;E - \"Well I\u0027m sorry to say she understands nothing about the game of football. She\u0027s under the impression that negroes could compete with whites at the sport!\"\n\n\u0026gt;JR - \"Oh really?\"\n\n\u0026gt;E - \"Yes you should sent her back to her sewing and the art of good housekeeping. Her pretty little head would be filled with less nonsense.\"\n\n\u0026gt;D - \"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\u0026gt;E - \"Negroes playing football! And why not women while we\u0027re at it? That would be quite amusing huh? Quite amusing.\"\n\n\u0026gt;(Laughing by all.)\n\n\u0026gt;JR - \"Annette, you silly girl. Some people... they look nice in a way. They can sound pleasing to the ear but on the inside, they\u0027re... how do we say my dear?\"\n\n\u0026gt;D - \"Rotten, to the core.\"\n\n\u0026gt;JR - \"Come on darling.\"\n\n\u0026gt;(They leave, leaving English guy looking embarrassed.)\n\nThe scene illustrates how desperate the script is to bash the English whilst doing it in the most ham-fisted way possible. The dialogue is like a joke.\n\nThe vendetta against the English extends to leaving out any mention of [Daniel Woolfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Burley_Woolfall), the 2nd President of FIFA and [Arthur Drewry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Drewry), the 5th President of FIFA. They had 18 years of leadership between them, but neither of them are mentioned once in the film. Why? Most likely because both are English. If this was meant to be a true history of FIFA, they would have been mentioned and/or appreciated, but this doesn\u0027t happen once in the movie.\n\nAfter FIFA is set-up, with even more English-bashing, two men walk out of a pub. One of them almost looks into the camera when he talks about how much of a bright future FIFA has, and we see them walking into the night with a transition straight out of the end of a black and white movie, where the screen fades into a circle. [Here is a screencap](http://imgur.com/Net8YUy).This is one of many odd editing decisions in the movie, and this transition is never used again. It\u0027s jarring to watch, as well as laughable.\n\n**\"He\u0027s mad!\" \"No, he\u0027s a visionary!\"**\n\nWe skip to Jules Rimet\u0027s presidency (the 3rd president of FIFA). He\u0027s fairly well-portrayed by Gerard Depardieu, but his character is completely without flaw and he is always on the right side of history with the most progressive ideas (see the scene I detailed earlier). For example, he worries about a financial crisis in America on the boat to the first World Cup, and wonders if it is right to hold a tournament in such conditions. His daughter convinces her otherwise - she is pretty much the only realistic and because of this, sympathetic character in the whole movie.\n\nThe quote for this section comes from two of his inner circle in response to his idea to create a \u0027World Cup\u0027. As he leaves through Paris, I have to say that the set designers did a good job of recreating what Paris would have looked like in that time period. However, it almost becomes like \u0027The Room\u0027; in that the production values do not match up to the script or the ideas that are being portrayed on screen. You do also notice how brown and grey much of the film is, mainly from the suits that the businessmen are wearing - I remember this colour scheme far more than the colours shown during recreations of football matches.\n\nThere is a scene inside Jules Rimet\u0027s house where Rimet and two other men are discussing the importance of setting up the World Cup (with more English bashing) which has fairly confusing editing. The three men are sitting in a triangle and the camera cuts between them from loads of different angles so many times that I remember being disorientated the first time that I saw it. Close ups on faces, wide shots, it was just too much and incoherent.\n\nThere\u0027s unintentional humor in a meeting with a Uruguayan official about possibly holding the World Cup there: \"FIFA is poor, but that does not mean that we will sell the one treasure we possess; honour.\" I\u0027m not sure that corruption was being hinted at here, because Jules Rimet got many guarantees that there would be no problems. FIFA wanted a proportion of ticket sales, but I think that\u0027s standard practice now.\n\nJumping ahead in the film a little (the CGI for the stadium being built is fairly good), there\u0027s a training sequence on a boat to the first World Cup (again, fairly good CGI) that is 34 seconds of Rimet watching the French squad train. It drags on forever, and it\u0027s not the only odd scene choice in the movie, but I\u0027ll get to that in a minute.\n\nThere is more unintentional humour when the Depression hits and all of the financial documentation is said to be present and correct.\n\nWe see a meeting before war breaks out between representatives of FIFA who engage in a tetchy exchange. [The myth of Hitler snubbing Jesse Owens](http://knowledgenuts.com/2013/11/05/hitler-did-not-snub-jesse-owens/) is repeated - the German guy said that it was an error of protocol, and it kind of was, and Rimet berates the Italian ambassador for Mussolini using the 1934 World Cup to promote fascism. It was used in this way, but the effect in the film is that it continues to build up Rimet\u0027s character to a nearly unassailable level. Here he is, bravely standing up to fascists, after we\u0027ve seen him worry about a bunch of other things. He still has no flaws.\n\nThe strangest scene in the movie comes next. [The Death Match](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_Match) is told to Jules Rimet, and he is visibly distraught by what he hears. He says \"we weren\u0027t there,\" and that is the only reason for this story to be in the film. FIFA had absolutely nothing to do with The Death Match. It\u0027s an interesting story - read the link at some point - but completely irrelevant to the film with no repercussions.\n\nAfter more English bashing (but to be fair, they did suck in the 1950 World Cup) we go to a recreation of the 1950 Cup final. This is fairly well done - the match scenes are fairly exciting, but the green screen of the crowd is not so great. But it is here that we get a really strange editing choice. Just before the final whistle, Rimet goes into the tunnel to give the World Cup to the Uruguayan players (look it up [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay_v_Brazil_%281950_FIFA_World_Cup%29), it\u0027s a famous final) and we get [this](http://imgur.com/s4YmS2P) sequence of shots. It starts when the final whistle goes and is so cliched and over-dramatic, it only induces laughter. Rimet does die (in 1956), but only after a short scene in slo-mo on the pitch, and his burial happens while we cut between his funeral and shots of him on the pitch.\n\nThe first section of this movie does offer an overall fairly - though extremely biased - interesting look at how FIFA was formed if you never knew anything about it, but it suffers from an inability to show *any* flaws in Jules Rimet. How can I sympathise with a perfect character? If this movie was made to make us admire Rimet, why not give him a single flaw? He seems inhuman.\n\nThe movie does get a lot worse from this point.\n\n**\"Blatter is apparently good at finding money.\"**\n\nOn a plane, Stanley Rous (the 6th FIFA president and English) talks to João Havelange. It is true that Rous\u0027 presidency was marred by racism, but his term is completely glossed over. He loses the election to Havelange, who has the support from the Africans (the election process is celebrated as being democratic, I kid you not. It reads as FIFA propaganda.), and Rous states that \"Africans don\u0027t understand the subtleties of football.\" It\u0027s more of the \u0027English are racists\u0027 theme we\u0027ve had throughout this movie.\n\nSam Neill does an OK job of portraying Havelange. I don\u0027t think that he was really the right man for the job, and I think that his Brazilian accent wavers a bit during the course of the movie. He introduces Blatter, who is played well by Tim Roth, to his committee, after banging his desk when he says that the accounts are \u0027disastrous\u0027 in a hilariously melodramatic way.\n\nBlatter talks to Coca-Cola, and then Adidas, in a scene that is like it\u0027s from a gangster movie - in a car park. The Adidas representative says that the ball should be the star of the World Cup. It\u0027s another major problem with this movie, a celebration of the corporate side of football that eventually outweighs the value of the performance of the players. It\u0027s saying that you should be cheering for the men behind the curtain, rather than the men on the football field; a horrible message.\n\nHavelange later becomes irritated when the Africans feel as though he is not doing enough for them. He later launches into a speech about how the World Cup unites people. He says \"And the World Cups that we organise do more for world peace than any resolution,\" in comparison with what Muhammed Ali did for black rights. But this just reeks of self-indulgence.\n\nBlatter talks about concentrating on women\u0027s football. The same Blatter that said that [women should wear skimpier clothing to make the sport more popular](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3402519.stm). He says that he wouldn\u0027t rest until World Cups were held in Asia and South Africa; it\u0027s obvious foreshadowing, and it almost feels like it\u0027s inserted by Blatter to justify himself remaining president. It has been suggested that he added a few lines to the script.\n\n\"An institution like ours cannot run on good intentions alone. We need money, a great deal of money.\" \"The slightest error on your part, and you\u0027re out.\" One scene between Havelange and Blatter where Blatter gets a promotion provides a great deal of comedy, especially with Sam Neill\u0027s accent slipping.\n\nThe next great drama comes from where money has gone missing, and Blatter doesn\u0027t know where it has gone. The comedy goes without speaking. This leads into a scene where Blatter bravely faces off against a group of journalists who are asking him a lot of questions about match fixing and video technology. \"This is a press conference, not a trial,\" is said. Blatter drives off when a journalist confronts him at his car asking \"who he was protecting,\" making him look guilty.\n\nWe have a montage with [laughable green screen effects](http://imgur.com/9ZQeOVd).\n\nBlatter confronts the FIFA committee saying that \"the slightest breach of ethics will be severely punished,\" in an attempt to crack down on corruption. Again, comedy. Some members say that Havelange would have treated them differently, hinting at corruption, but it\u0027s never really expanded upon. Blatter never takes Havelange to task for this and it\u0027s a problem with the rest of the film too. There are tiny, tiny hints that corruption may be going on at the top, but no-one is ever really \u0027brought to task\u0027 over it. The journalist from before comes back - Blatter says he\u0027ll defend his \u0027family\u0027 when referring to FIFA. The journalist asks \"Are the people you\u0027re protecting worthy?\" to which there is no reply. Again, there\u0027s a hint of corruption but it\u0027s never really picked up on later in the movie, there\u0027s no real self-reflection by Blatter. We then see Blatter at home. His family are dancing but he\u0027s on the phone looking worried. This at least continues the theme of him putting work before his family, one of the few things the movie does OK on.\n\nWe later see Blatter in a meeting and big problems are discussed. There are insurers refuse to insure the Cup, a diplomatic incident between South Korea and Japan (the two hosts of the 2002 World Cup), and the journalist from before wrote a book called \"Big Game, The Well Hidden Secrets Of FIFA\". One thing to note is that the journalist in this film, Edgar Wilcox, doesn\u0027t actually exist. He was most likely based on [Andrew Jennings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jennings), who wrote a book called \"FOUL! The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote-Rigging and Ticket Scandals\". When Blatter looks aghast at the book, I read this as FIFA trying to discredit the investigative journalistic work done by people against them; abhorrent considering what we now know. But the worst thing, at least in the context of the movie, is that *none* of these plot lines are resolved. They are all forgotten about, never to be mentioned again. If FIFA were trying to paint themselves as heroic, then surely they would have devoted screen time to showing them actually solving these issues. It adds to the mounting confusion.\n\nBlatter is facing an election in Seoul and there are 24 members on the executive committee. He meets with Havelange on the boat who (Havelange) says \"One day I will be exonerated, I know.\" Blatter is sure of 8 votes in the re-election, but he says that he need 13 to win. Havelange says to make indecisive people fear him. This implies that the electorate will be 24 people, but as you will see soon, this makes little sense. \n\nAfter more comedy - \"A transfer of power has become inevitable.\" - we get to the climax of this movie. What we\u0027ve waited 1 hour 45 minutes for. We see Blatter walking in slo-mo to hear the result of his re-election fight and when he gets there, what do you know? He wins by 139 votes. But this made no sense to me, as the previous scenes implied that he needed the votes of the executive committee to win, as I detailed before. Believe me, I saw this movie twice, they do not resolve this, or make mention of a wider electorate. Blatter says \"Ladies and Gentlemen in the name of FIFA I thank you,\" and then we cut to the Golden goal in the framing scene, which I detailed at the beginning. Plotlines are just left unresolved. While the kids are playing, we hear this speech: \n\n\"In over 100 years of existence this federation, born of a dream, has survived two World Wars, an unprecedented economic crisis and made football the most played sport on our planet. If anyone had told us that one day FIFA would have over 200 member associations in its ranks, more than the UN, that people of all races and origins would play together, if we had known that women would fall in love with this game and end up filling entire stadiums, that football would be played in gymnasiums and schools, that people would listen to the sound of the ball, that this ball would bounce to every corner of the Earth and that it would leave its imprint on the history of mankind, well, who would have believed this?\"\n\nWho would have believed this indeed? As the credits play, and we see the World Cup being awarded to South Africa, completing one of the few narrative threads in this movie, Nelson Mandela is shown celebrating (Tim Roth is green screened in again, but it\u0027s a lot better this time). He is simply too good to appear in this movie, not even from archive footage.\n\n**Conclusions.**\n\nWhat can I say? What more can I say about this movie? What about the people who made this movie? Gerard Depardieu didn\u0027t think that it was that bad; as we know, he wanted it to be shown at Cannes. Tim Roth told Die Welt, also reported [here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/united-passions/director-fifa-flop/) in the Telegraph, that “Yeah, I apologize I didn’t question the director, I didn’t question the script. This is a role that will have my father turning in his grave.” I also read elsewhere that he hasn\u0027t seen the movie, and that he wondered where all of the corruption was in the script. Do we blame the director? I was going to give him a lot of stick, but I read his interview with The Hollywood Reporter [here](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fifa-scandal-director-frederic-auburtin-802717) where he called the film a \u0027disaster\u0027. Here are some fun facts - but read the whole interview anyway, it\u0027s very interesting.\n\n- Scripts usually take about a year to write and finalise. FIFA wanted it done in 4 months.\n\n- The film was going to be very different at first, with more - proper - hints of corruption. That\u0027s probably why there are so many small nearly-hints of corruption that amount to absolutely nothing in the film, or are completely justified by all of the characters.\n\n- FIFA funded 80% of the budget.\n\nIt almost seems like the film was a compromise that pleased absolutely nobody, except maybe Blatter, who is portrayed as a hero and a crusader against corruption. It\u0027s obvious that FIFA had a lot of influence in this movie, but it\u0027s not convincing enough to be a propaganda film. Far from it. Bits of the movie are laughable, and there is loads of unintentional humour in the dialogue - I am convinced that it is unintentional by the way, much of it reads like a weak attempt at glorification or one-dimensional character building. I remember the film being so grey and brown reflecting the suits and buildings that the characters wear and inhabit. It overpowers the recreation of football matches to the extent that I barely remember the matches when I look back on the movie. Combine that with some odd editing choices, a completely unfocused plotline, and Sam Neill\u0027s accent slipping (it\u0027s really noticeable on the 2nd viewing) and, whilst there are a few good performances, some good music and (mostly) good CGI, you have a not very good movie. It also goes on for far too long.\n\nBut what elevates this movie (or rather lowers it) is the unabashed and, in my view, sickening way that FIFA are attempting to trumpet their moral superiority. Journalists are invented and are portrayed as straw men because FIFA have never done anything wrong. FIFA have advanced the causes of women and minorities the world over, and have done so in a more effective manner than any other organisation on Earth; not even the UN can do what they do. Blatter brought about new changes to stop FIFA corruption, bringing the executive committee into line and he would stop corruption happening in the future. The English are all terrible - I am 90% sure that this is because of work by English journalists to expose FIFA. FIFA were always on the right side of history. It\u0027s all a pack of lies, done so in the most clichéd way imaginable.\n\nAnd that is why this film was really made, if I\u0027m looking at it honestly. It\u0027s a failed piece of corporate propaganda, that is effective at removing pretty much all references to wrongdoing, as well as a failed look at the history of FIFA. Sure, some of the early stuff is interesting, but it is so biased and skips out so much, I just can\u0027t trust a word of what anyone in the movie says. I would love to talk to the director to find out what scenes have been changed, as what I\u0027ve read implies that there were a huge amount of changes. The director has also talked about doing a sequel of sorts, and it would be interesting to see that in the future - a properly dramatised look at FIFA and the ethics of what they have done.\n\nSo should you watch it? If you don\u0027t mind watching a completely unfocused film for a fair amount of unintentional humour, it\u0027s probably worth a look. But keep in mind that if you decide to watch it, it will be really, really bad.","selftextHTML":"\u0026lt;!-- SC_OFF --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div class\u003d\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Why was this film made? When I was watching United Passions, and in the hours and days and now weeks after watching it, I still haven\u0026amp;#39;t come to any real conclusion that would satisfy me.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Let\u0026amp;#39;s rewind a bit. Some of you who know me a little better may be asking how I saw this movie when I live in the UK. Well, I ordered the movie off the French version of Amazon and I had it delivered to my house. This meant that I had to watch the film in English with French subtitles, but it wasn\u0026amp;#39;t really a problem. The only bit where there were no English subtitles was during one of the football matches where a (Brazilian?) commentator was commentating, and I had to follow the French subtitles. I understood 90% of those, so it wasn\u0026amp;#39;t really a problem.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;There are so many problems with this movie, it would be best if I just went through in a rough chronological order to show them, and expanding on thematic problems when I come across them. I\u0026amp;#39;ll divide the review into sections too, with quotes from the film.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Also, if you even care, there are spoilers in this review.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026amp;quot;What do the foreigners understand of our beautiful game?\u0026amp;quot;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The first thing that made me laugh was that this film was an official selection at Cannes. It\u0026amp;#39;s come to light recently that this was at \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/16/depardieu-insisted-show-fifa-film-united-passions-cannes-head\"\u0026gt;Depardieu\u0026amp;#39;s insistence\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, which explains a lot. The second thing that made me laugh was this quote:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026amp;quot;While this story is inspired by actual events and real people, certain characters portrayed, characterizations, scenes and dialogue spoken represent a work of dramatic fiction.\u0026amp;quot;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This is basically FIFA admitting that what you are about to watch is mostly made up. If this film was supposed to be an accurate history of FIFA, this disclaimer would be much shorter. When the film opens, we see a group of kids meeting up to play football on a dusty pitch. A girl jumps off a bench to join them while the locals watch on. This clichéd device appears several times in this movie, sometimes at random intervals, and it is so obvious that FIFA are shamelessly using this in an attempt to show how \u0026amp;#39;diverse\u0026amp;#39; they are. The plot running through this device makes no sense either; throughout the film, we see that the girl is the goalkeeper, but she misses every save that she makes. In the end of the film, not only does she make a save, but she beats every other player on the pitch to score at the other end of the field. Not only is this unrealistic, considering her apparent skill level, it is laughable. It is also really condescending to women\u0026amp;#39;s football.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I haven\u0026amp;#39;t even got into the film proper yet. A letter is written by Hirschman (the eventual 2nd General Secretary of FIFA) about the need for a united organisation. We cut to a football match being played in England, with many English folk appearing in top hats, and a \u0026amp;#39;toff\u0026amp;#39; with a monocle - who is also the president of the English FA - stands up to disparage a player. The quote for this section comes from him. This theme of \u0026amp;#39;bashing England\u0026amp;#39; and \u0026amp;#39;unpleasant Englishmen\u0026amp;#39; is one of the few consistent themes in the movie, and it happens to pretty much every English character. Not one opportunity is wasted, as one of the FA derides the people attempting to set up FIFA in such a heavy handed way, you\u0026amp;#39;d almost think that he was a pantomime villain. I kid you not, this is the transcript of a scene later on in the movie, with an English person, Jules Rimet and Jules Rimet\u0026amp;#39;s daughter before the 1st World Cup:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;English Guy - \u0026amp;quot;May I say young lady that all this makes absolutely no moral sense. What\u0026amp;#39;s the use in organising the World Cup in the Americas in a country no-one\u0026amp;#39;s heard of, which is a stranger to modernity. And why not at the tip of Africa with the Zulus while we\u0026amp;#39;re at it?\u0026amp;quot;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Jules Rimet\u0026amp;#39;s Daughter - \u0026amp;quot;Why not indeed? Who knows, the Zulus may be excellent football players; maybe they just don\u0026amp;#39;t know it yet.\u0026amp;quot;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;E - \u0026amp;quot;But young lady, the natives of Africa are stupid and undisciplined, it\u0026amp;#39;s just their nature. How could they possibly be expected to appreciate the subtleties of the game invented by the whites?\u0026amp;quot;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Jules Rimet - (Entering) \u0026amp;quot;Ah my girl, are you having a pleasant evening?\u0026amp;quot;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;E - \u0026amp;quot;Ah, Monsieur Rimet, this young person is your daughter?\u0026amp;quot;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;JR - \u0026amp;quot;Indeed she is.\u0026amp;quot;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;E - \u0026amp;quot;Well I\u0026amp;#39;m sorry to say she understands nothing about the game of football. She\u0026amp;#39;s under the impression that negroes could compete with whites at the sport!\u0026amp;quot;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;JR - \u0026amp;quot;Oh really?\u0026amp;quot;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;E - \u0026amp;quot;Yes you should sent her back to her sewing and the art of good housekeeping. Her pretty little head would be filled with less nonsense.\u0026amp;quot;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;D - \u0026amp;quot;I beg your pardon?\u0026amp;quot;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;E - \u0026amp;quot;Negroes playing football!

Quite amusing.\u0026amp;quot;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;(Laughing by all.)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;JR - \u0026amp;quot;Annette, you silly girl. Some people... they look nice in a way.

The dialogue is like a joke.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The vendetta against the English extends to leaving out any mention of \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Burley_Woolfall\"\u0026gt;Daniel Woolfall\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, the 2nd President of FIFA and \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Drewry\"\u0026gt;Arthur Drewry\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, the 5th President of FIFA. They had 18 years of leadership between them, but neither of them are mentioned once in the film. Why? Most likely because both are English. If this was meant to be a true history of FIFA, they would have been mentioned and/or appreciated, but this doesn\u0026amp;#39;t happen once in the movie.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;After FIFA is set-up, with even more English-bashing, two men walk out of a pub. One of them almost looks into the camera when he talks about how much of a bright future FIFA has, and we see them walking into the night with a transition straight out of the end of a black and white movie, where the screen fades into a circle. \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://imgur.com/Net8YUy\"\u0026gt;Here is a screencap\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;.This is one of many odd editing decisions in the movie, and this transition is never used again. It\u0026amp;#39;s jarring to watch, as well as laughable.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026amp;quot;He\u0026amp;#39;s mad!\u0026amp;quot; \u0026amp;quot;No, he\u0026amp;#39;s a visionary!\u0026amp;quot;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We skip to Jules Rimet\u0026amp;#39;s presidency (the 3rd president of FIFA). He\u0026amp;#39;s fairly well-portrayed by Gerard Depardieu, but his character is completely without flaw and he is always on the right side of history with the most progressive ideas (see the scene I detailed earlier). For example, he worries about a financial crisis in America on the boat to the first World Cup, and wonders if it is right to hold a tournament in such conditions. His daughter convinces her otherwise - she is pretty much the only realistic and because of this, sympathetic character in the whole movie.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The quote for this section comes from two of his inner circle in response to his idea to create a \u0026amp;#39;World Cup\u0026amp;#39;. As he leaves through Paris, I have to say that the set designers did a good job of recreating what Paris would have looked like in that time period. However, it almost becomes like \u0026amp;#39;The Room\u0026amp;#39;; in that the production values do not match up to the script or the ideas that are being portrayed on screen. You do also notice how brown and grey much of the film is, mainly from the suits that the businessmen are wearing - I remember this colour scheme far more than the colours shown during recreations of football matches.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;There is a scene inside Jules Rimet\u0026amp;#39;s house where Rimet and two other men are discussing the importance of setting up the World Cup (with more English bashing) which has fairly confusing editing. The three men are sitting in a triangle and the camera cuts between them from loads of different angles so many times that I remember being disorientated the first time that I saw it. Close ups on faces, wide shots, it was just too much and incoherent.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;There\u0026amp;#39;s unintentional humor in a meeting with a Uruguayan official about possibly holding the World Cup there: \u0026amp;quot;FIFA is poor, but that does not mean that we will sell the one treasure we possess; honour.\u0026amp;quot; I\u0026amp;#39;m not sure that corruption was being hinted at here, because Jules Rimet got many guarantees that there would be no problems. FIFA wanted a proportion of ticket sales, but I think that\u0026amp;#39;s standard practice now.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Jumping ahead in the film a little (the CGI for the stadium being built is fairly good), there\u0026amp;#39;s a training sequence on a boat to the first World Cup (again, fairly good CGI) that is 34 seconds of Rimet watching the French squad train. It drags on forever, and it\u0026amp;#39;s not the only odd scene choice in the movie, but I\u0026amp;#39;ll get to that in a minute.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;There is more unintentional humour when the Depression hits and all of the financial documentation is said to be present and correct.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We see a meeting before war breaks out between representatives of FIFA who engage in a tetchy exchange. \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://knowledgenuts.com/2013/11/05/hitler-did-not-snub-jesse-owens/\"\u0026gt;The myth of Hitler snubbing Jesse Owens\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; is repeated - the German guy said that it was an error of protocol, and it kind of was, and Rimet berates the Italian ambassador for Mussolini using the 1934 World Cup to promote fascism. It was used in this way, but the effect in the film is that it continues to build up Rimet\u0026amp;#39;s character to a nearly unassailable level. Here he is, bravely standing up to fascists, after we\u0026amp;#39;ve seen him worry about a bunch of other things. He still has no flaws.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The strangest scene in the movie comes next. \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_Match\"\u0026gt;The Death Match\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; is told to Jules Rimet, and he is visibly distraught by what he hears. He says \u0026amp;quot;we weren\u0026amp;#39;t there,\u0026amp;quot; and that is the only reason for this story to be in the film. FIFA had absolutely nothing to do with The Death Match. It\u0026amp;#39;s an interesting story - read the link at some point - but completely irrelevant to the film with no repercussions.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;After more English bashing (but to be fair, they did suck in the 1950 World Cup) we go to a recreation of the 1950 Cup final. This is fairly well done - the match scenes are fairly exciting, but the green screen of the crowd is not so great. But it is here that we get a really strange editing choice. Just before the final whistle, Rimet goes into the tunnel to give the World Cup to the Uruguayan players (look it up \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay_v_Brazil_%281950_FIFA_World_Cup%29\"\u0026gt;here\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, it\u0026amp;#39;s a famous final) and we get \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://imgur.com/s4YmS2P\"\u0026gt;this\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; sequence of shots. It starts when the final whistle goes and is so cliched and over-dramatic, it only induces laughter. Rimet does die (in 1956), but only after a short scene in slo-mo on the pitch, and his burial happens while we cut between his funeral and shots of him on the pitch.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The first section of this movie does offer an overall fairly - though extremely biased - interesting look at how FIFA was formed if you never knew anything about it, but it suffers from an inability to show \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;any\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; flaws in Jules Rimet. How can I sympathise with a perfect character? If this movie was made to make us admire Rimet, why not give him a single flaw? He seems inhuman.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The movie does get a lot worse from this point.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026amp;quot;Blatter is apparently good at finding money.\u0026amp;quot;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;On a plane, Stanley Rous (the 6th FIFA president and English) talks to João Havelange. It is true that Rous\u0026amp;#39; presidency was marred by racism, but his term is completely glossed over. He loses the election to Havelange, who has the support from the Africans (the election process is celebrated as being democratic, I kid you not. It reads as FIFA propaganda.), and Rous states that \u0026amp;quot;Africans don\u0026amp;#39;t understand the subtleties of football.\u0026amp;quot; It\u0026amp;#39;s more of the \u0026amp;#39;English are racists\u0026amp;#39; theme we\u0026amp;#39;ve had throughout this movie.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Sam Neill does an OK job of portraying Havelange. I don\u0026amp;#39;t think that he was really the right man for the job, and I think that his Brazilian accent wavers a bit during the course of the movie. He introduces Blatter, who is played well by Tim Roth, to his committee, after banging his desk when he says that the accounts are \u0026amp;#39;disastrous\u0026amp;#39; in a hilariously melodramatic way.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Blatter talks to Coca-Cola, and then Adidas, in a scene that is like it\u0026amp;#39;s from a gangster movie - in a car park. The Adidas representative says that the ball should be the star of the World Cup. It\u0026amp;#39;s another major problem with this movie, a celebration of the corporate side of football that eventually outweighs the value of the performance of the players. It\u0026amp;#39;s saying that you should be cheering for the men behind the curtain, rather than the men on the football field; a horrible message.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Havelange later becomes irritated when the Africans feel as though he is not doing enough for them. He later launches into a speech about how the World Cup unites people. He says \u0026amp;quot;And the World Cups that we organise do more for world peace than any resolution,\u0026amp;quot; in comparison with what Muhammed Ali did for black rights. But this just reeks of self-indulgence.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Blatter talks about concentrating on women\u0026amp;#39;s football. The same Blatter that said that \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3402519.stm\"\u0026gt;women should wear skimpier clothing to make the sport more popular\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;. He says that he wouldn\u0026amp;#39;t rest until World Cups were held in Asia and South Africa; it\u0026amp;#39;s obvious foreshadowing, and it almost feels like it\u0026amp;#39;s inserted by Blatter to justify himself remaining president. It has been suggested that he added a few lines to the script.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026amp;quot;An institution like ours cannot run on good intentions alone. We need money, a great deal of money.\u0026amp;quot; \u0026amp;quot;The slightest error on your part, and you\u0026amp;#39;re out.\u0026amp;quot; One scene between Havelange and Blatter where Blatter gets a promotion provides a great deal of comedy, especially with Sam Neill\u0026amp;#39;s accent slipping.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The next great drama comes from where money has gone missing, and Blatter doesn\u0026amp;#39;t know where it has gone. The comedy goes without speaking. This leads into a scene where Blatter bravely faces off against a group of journalists who are asking him a lot of questions about match fixing and video technology. \u0026amp;quot;This is a press conference, not a trial,\u0026amp;quot; is said. Blatter drives off when a journalist confronts him at his car asking \u0026amp;quot;who he was protecting,\u0026amp;quot; making him look guilty.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We have a montage with \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://imgur.com/9ZQeOVd\"\u0026gt;laughable green screen effects\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Blatter confronts the FIFA committee saying that \u0026amp;quot;the slightest breach of ethics will be severely punished,\u0026amp;quot; in an attempt to crack down on corruption. Again, comedy. Some members say that Havelange would have treated them differently, hinting at corruption, but it\u0026amp;#39;s never really expanded upon. Blatter never takes Havelange to task for this and it\u0026amp;#39;s a problem with the rest of the film too. There are tiny, tiny hints that corruption may be going on at the top, but no-one is ever really \u0026amp;#39;brought to task\u0026amp;#39; over it. The journalist from before comes back - Blatter says he\u0026amp;#39;ll defend his \u0026amp;#39;family\u0026amp;#39; when referring to FIFA. The journalist asks \u0026amp;quot;Are the people you\u0026amp;#39;re protecting worthy?\u0026amp;quot; to which there is no reply. Again, there\u0026amp;#39;s a hint of corruption but it\u0026amp;#39;s never really picked up on later in the movie, there\u0026amp;#39;s no real self-reflection by Blatter. We then see Blatter at home. His family are dancing but he\u0026amp;#39;s on the phone looking worried. This at least continues the theme of him putting work before his family, one of the few things the movie does OK on.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We later see Blatter in a meeting and big problems are discussed. There are insurers refuse to insure the Cup, a diplomatic incident between South Korea and Japan (the two hosts of the 2002 World Cup), and the journalist from before wrote a book called \u0026amp;quot;Big Game, The Well Hidden Secrets Of FIFA\u0026amp;quot;. One thing to note is that the journalist in this film, Edgar Wilcox, doesn\u0026amp;#39;t actually exist. He was most likely based on \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jennings\"\u0026gt;Andrew Jennings\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, who wrote a book called \u0026amp;quot;FOUL! The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote-Rigging and Ticket Scandals\u0026amp;quot;. When Blatter looks aghast at the book, I read this as FIFA trying to discredit the investigative journalistic work done by people against them; abhorrent considering what we now know. But the worst thing, at least in the context of the movie, is that \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;none\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; of these plot lines are resolved. They are all forgotten about, never to be mentioned again. If FIFA were trying to paint themselves as heroic, then surely they would have devoted screen time to showing them actually solving these issues. It adds to the mounting confusion.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Blatter is facing an election in Seoul and there are 24 members on the executive committee. He meets with Havelange on the boat who (Havelange) says \u0026amp;quot;One day I will be exonerated, I know.\u0026amp;quot; Blatter is sure of 8 votes in the re-election, but he says that he need 13 to win. Havelange says to make indecisive people fear him. This implies that the electorate will be 24 people, but as you will see soon, this makes little sense. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;After more comedy - \u0026amp;quot;A transfer of power has become inevitable.\u0026amp;quot; - we get to the climax of this movie. What we\u0026amp;#39;ve waited 1 hour 45 minutes for. We see Blatter walking in slo-mo to hear the result of his re-election fight and when he gets there, what do you know? He wins by 139 votes. But this made no sense to me, as the previous scenes implied that he needed the votes of the executive committee to win, as I detailed before. Believe me, I saw this movie twice, they do not resolve this, or make mention of a wider electorate. Blatter says \u0026amp;quot;Ladies and Gentlemen in the name of FIFA I thank you,\u0026amp;quot; and then we cut to the Golden goal in the framing scene, which I detailed at the beginning. Plotlines are just left unresolved. While the kids are playing, we hear this speech: \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026amp;quot;In over 100 years of existence this federation, born of a dream, has survived two World Wars, an unprecedented economic crisis and made football the most played sport on our planet. If anyone had told us that one day FIFA would have over 200 member associations in its ranks, more than the UN, that people of all races and origins would play together, if we had known that women would fall in love with this game and end up filling entire stadiums, that football would be played in gymnasiums and schools, that people would listen to the sound of the ball, that this ball would bounce to every corner of the Earth and that it would leave its imprint on the history of mankind, well, who would have believed this?\u0026amp;quot;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Who would have believed this indeed? As the credits play, and we see the World Cup being awarded to South Africa, completing one of the few narrative threads in this movie, Nelson Mandela is shown celebrating (Tim Roth is green screened in again, but it\u0026amp;#39;s a lot better this time). He is simply too good to appear in this movie, not even from archive footage.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Conclusions.\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;What can I say? What more can I say about this movie? What about the people who made this movie? Gerard Depardieu didn\u0026amp;#39;t think that it was that bad; as we know, he wanted it to be shown at Cannes. Tim Roth told Die Welt, also reported \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/united-passions/director-fifa-flop/\"\u0026gt;here\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; in the Telegraph, that “Yeah, I apologize I didn’t question the director, I didn’t question the script. This is a role that will have my father turning in his grave.” I also read elsewhere that he hasn\u0026amp;#39;t seen the movie, and that he wondered where all of the corruption was in the script. Do we blame the director? I was going to give him a lot of stick, but I read his interview with The Hollywood Reporter \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fifa-scandal-director-frederic-auburtin-802717\"\u0026gt;here\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; where he called the film a \u0026amp;#39;disaster\u0026amp;#39;. Here are some fun facts - but read the whole interview anyway, it\u0026amp;#39;s very interesting.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Scripts usually take about a year to write and finalise. FIFA wanted it done in 4 months.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The film was going to be very different at first, with more - proper - hints of corruption. That\u0026amp;#39;s probably why there are so many small nearly-hints of corruption that amount to absolutely nothing in the film, or are completely justified by all of the characters.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;FIFA funded 80% of the budget.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;It almost seems like the film was a compromise that pleased absolutely nobody, except maybe Blatter, who is portrayed as a hero and a crusader against corruption. It\u0026amp;#39;s obvious that FIFA had a lot of influence in this movie, but it\u0026amp;#39;s not convincing enough to be a propaganda film. Far from it. Bits of the movie are laughable, and there is loads of unintentional humour in the dialogue - I am convinced that it is unintentional by the way, much of it reads like a weak attempt at glorification or one-dimensional character building. I remember the film being so grey and brown reflecting the suits and buildings that the characters wear and inhabit. It overpowers the recreation of football matches to the extent that I barely remember the matches when I look back on the movie. Combine that with some odd editing choices, a completely unfocused plotline, and Sam Neill\u0026amp;#39;s accent slipping (it\u0026amp;#39;s really noticeable on the 2nd viewing) and, whilst there are a few good performances, some good music and (mostly) good CGI, you have a not very good movie. It also goes on for far too long.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;But what elevates this movie (or rather lowers it) is the unabashed and, in my view, sickening way that FIFA are attempting to trumpet their moral superiority. Journalists are invented and are portrayed as straw men because FIFA have never done anything wrong. FIFA have advanced the causes of women and minorities the world over, and have done so in a more effective manner than any other organisation on Earth; not even the UN can do what they do. Blatter brought about new changes to stop FIFA corruption, bringing the executive committee into line and he would stop corruption happening in the future. The English are all terrible - I am 90% sure that this is because of work by English journalists to expose FIFA. FIFA were always on the right side of history. It\u0026amp;#39;s all a pack of lies, done so in the most clichéd way imaginable.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;And that is why this film was really made, if I\u0026amp;#39;m looking at it honestly. It\u0026amp;#39;s a failed piece of corporate propaganda, that is effective at removing pretty much all references to wrongdoing, as well as a failed look at the history of FIFA. Sure, some of the early stuff is interesting, but it is so biased and skips out so much, I just can\u0026amp;#39;t trust a word of what anyone in the movie says. I would love to talk to the director to find out what scenes have been changed, as what I\u0026amp;#39;ve read implies that there were a huge amount of changes. The director has also talked about doing a sequel of sorts, and it would be interesting to see that in the future - a properly dramatised look at FIFA and the ethics of what they have done.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So should you watch it? If you don\u0026amp;#39;t mind watching a completely unfocused film for a fair amount of unintentional humour, it\u0026amp;#39;s probably worth a look. But keep in mind that if you decide to watch it, it will be really, really bad.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;","domain":"self.soccer","gilded":0,"commentCount":132,"score":856,"upVotes":856,"downVotes":0,"created":1.435354668E9,"createdUTC":1.435325868E9,"visited":false,"self":false,"saved":false,"edited":false,"stickied":false,"nsfw":false,"hidden":false,"clicked":false,"kind":"t3","identifier":"3b6wxr","fullName":"t3_3b6wxr"}],"sankeyNodes":[],"sentiments":[]}
