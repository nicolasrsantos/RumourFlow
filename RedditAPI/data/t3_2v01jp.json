I\u0027ve had this conversation online with so many times now that I cannot continue make the argument every time, because it inevitably involves writing a huge amount. I cannot spend the time to write an entire book to every Muslim online who is desperate to believe that the bloody madness which is burning it way across the world right now is caused by something besides Islamic religious belief. So I am going to say what I have to say and leave it at that.\n\nThe first thing that you have to understand is that you are operating under an emotional need: you, for whatever reason are *desperate* to believe that the terrorism that is happening right now, and has been happening for years, is caused by something - anything, besides Islam. \n\nSo your mind is searching for explanations that might point the blame for the mayhem elswhere - economics, politics, something like that. \n\nThere are articles making this claim, but unfortunately, their arguments are full of holes big enough to [fly a Boeing 747](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003ddlQjHviRjiU) through. In case you think I am motivated by prejudice, or belief in another religion (I\u0027m an atheist), I am not. Furthermore, there are many people from the Muslim world - believers and apostates - who say the same as I do: Islamic doctrine is the primary cause of terrorism committed by Muslims in the name of Islam. Here is Ali Rizvi. Rizvi was born in Pakistan, and grew up in Saudi Arabia and Libya. He was raised as a Muslim, but left the faith. Read what he has to say:\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/ali-a-rizvi/an-atheist-muslims-perspective-on-the-root-causes-of-islamist-jihadism-and-the-politics-of-islamophobia_b_3159286.html\n\n\u0026gt;Not only do you exaggerate but you are completely writing a false statement.\n\nI\u0027m not exaggerating, and my statement is not false. In fact, your reply is just another example of the total denial that I have described above. Notice that you don\u0027t actually provide any evidence against what I have said. If you want to see the evidence for the state of denial that I point out above, try reading the articles that get published after a terrorist attack. Hundreds of such apologetic articles appear after every terrorist attack Muslim writers are in total denial about what is being taught in their mosques.\n\n\u0026gt;Wait a minute so you know what every Muslim things about?\n\nWhere did I say that I know what \"ever Muslim thinks about?\" I made no such claim. I challenge you to offer a quote to prove it. At no point did I claim to \"know what every Muslim thinks about\".\n\nThe rest of your reply above is just more time-wasting bickering.\n\n\u0026gt; Which Muslims said that, you brought no evidence to your table. \n\nYou did, in a comment above mate: \n\n\u0026gt;How can you employ those same things to a different culture, from Europe to Middle East. A common sense would see the turmoil of many dictators, lack of education, extremely poverty and huge instability in the region helped shaped the fundamentalist extremism. \n\nWhat you are saying here, is that the dictators, lack of education etc, helped shape the fundamentalist extremism.\nWhile this is true, the problem with focusing on these is that \"fundamentalist extremism\" has a very strong grounding in the fundamental beliefs of Islam. Jihad against the \"infidel\" (however freely defined), is [considered to be a religious duty](http://www.al-islam.org/a-muslim-in-society-al-balagh/jihad-holy-struggle-obligatory-duty) for Muslims.\n\nAnd come to think of it, weren\u0027t the Prophet Muhammad and the Caliphs that followed him also dictators of a similar kind? That\u0027s the truth after all. The Prophet Muhammad and the Caliphs that followed him were the Saddam Husseins, the Colonel Qaddafis of their day: a cruel tyrants that ruled over a violent empire. \n\nThe religion of Islam is the ideology that emerged during the days of the Caliphate - the ideology of a violent, expansionist empire, and it shows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","duration":"","id":67,"color":"black","redditID":"t1_coembl1","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":66,"links":[65],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"UmarAlKhattab","label":"\u0026gt; I\u0027m afraid that this is not true.

DAVID COOK, Professor in Religious Studies at Rice University, Texas:\n\n\u0026gt;“As a scholar of Islam myself, I find Ibn Warraq’s attitude to be very refreshing, and his scholarship for the most part to be accurate and devastating in pinpointing weaknesses in Muslim orthodoxy. His third essay, “Some Aspects of the History of Koran Criticism, 700 CE to 2005 CE,” could almost serve as a history of our field, and of its systematic failure to critique the foundational texts of Islam as those of other faiths have been critiqued.[1] It is an embarrassment for Islamic Studies that no critical text of the Qur’an has been produced.[2] However, even were this basic, elemental work done, there would be still a great more to be done in order to counter one of the most fundamental Muslim presuppositions””namely, that the text of the Qur’an has remained absolutely unaltered since the time of the Prophet Muhammad in the seventh century of the Common Era. Ibn Warraq counters this nonsense, which one hears on a regular basis even from educated Muslims who should know better, by demonstrating the prevalence of variant readings of the Qur’anic text.[3] That the existence of these variants, known as qira”at, demonstrates the falsity of the orthodox Muslim position vis-Ã -vis the Qur’an is obvious, and yet bizarrely rejected even by mainstream scholars.[4]“\n\nUnderstandably, Muslim people (of whom Warraq used to be one, having grown up in an Indian-Muslim family in Karachi, Pakistan) don\u0027t like what Warraq has to say, they shouldn\u0027t rule him out.

A doctrinal difference between Christianity and Islam is that in Christianity, the doctrines fundamental principles of peace and selfless love resists the more primitive and barbaric scriptures, but with Islam, anything in the doctrine that promotes peace is later abrogated by the conversion by sword principles.\n\nYou can point to the bad bible verses all day long but will just be met with some New Testament abrogation of those verses.

You *can not* use Islamic doctrine to decouple violence from Islamic religious principles.

In predominantly Christian countries that are poor and politically unstable, there is also extreme, religiously tinged violence. In the Central African Republic and Uganda, Christian groups have invoked their religion to justify mass slaughter of Muslims, the kidnapping of children to fight as soldiers, and a thousand other terrible acts. Of course, there is a concrete political background to this violence, and claiming it has to do with details of doctrine, as many people want to do, would be incredibly naive.\n\nIn general, reading this thread, it\u0027s as if most of the posters want to ignore the incredible amount of violence Western nations have engaged in in the Middle East in order to further their own agendas. Many posters here see violence committed by Muslims, and jump on it because it\u0027s another opportunity to attack religion. But the entire background, the invasion of Iraq by the United States, the deliberate destabilization of Libya and Syria in order to topple governments unfriendly to the West, the significant support given by the United States throughout the 1980s to radical Sunni fundamentalists as a counterweight to the Soviet Union and Arab secular nationalism - it\u0027s as if none of that exists, as if it can all be ignored and we can just pretend the Middle East is in the situation it\u0027s in right now because of some lines picked out of the Hadith.\n\nThat\u0027s the problem here. It\u0027s possible to be atheist, but to also be educated about history and politics and not to try to boil everything down to passages you don\u0027t like in various holy books, as pleasing as that might be.","duration":"","id":93,"color":"black","redditID":"t1_coeodob","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":92,"links":[91],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"flexx0325","label":"Of course the doctrine of Christianity says the same thing.

There is, however, much controversy regarding Christian doctrine in relation to Christians who are murdering others under abrogated Abrahamic doctrine).\n\nAlso, and more importantly--\n\n\u0026gt;These days Christian violence still exists. Look at the Evangelical Christians in Uganda who got the government there to start killing gay people in gods name.\nLook at the worshipers of Christ in Russia - who are also murdering gay people.\nLook at the pope insisting birth control including basic disease prevention is amoral, even if you live in Africa and you KNOW your husband has AIDS.\n\nAll these \"christians\" are doing this in the name of their misunderstood perception of the Christian god. They\u0027re cherry picking the violence promotion and they\u0027re neglecting their own religious doctrine when it comes to functional and peaceful behavior.\n\nBut, ISIS, as well as all the other Muslim \"extremists?\" They\u0027re not misunderstanding anything in Islamic doctrine. They\u0027re following it down to every collective principle and religious motivation. They\u0027re only murdering people because they\u0027re not ignoring the doctrine\u0027s unabashed aggressive influence.\n\nThis is quite a significant distinction I\u0027ve pointed out between the two religions and their corresponding doctrines. This is the distinction that\u0027s key to understanding in the concern for Muslims and Islamic influence.","duration":"","id":134,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_codrty9","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":133,"links":[1],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"darktidemage","label":"These days Christian violence still exists.

That\u0027s why Christians of today aren\u0027t as militant as they used to be. Muslims are largely still living in an environment in which the primary motivation is acceptance in a small, close-knit community. \n\nA small number of people subscribing to a more militant belief structure that feeds on acceptance and a sense of brotherhood can spread their message much more quickly in that sort of environment. Without easy access to technology that could allow them to measure their beliefs relative to a larger body of knowledge, they\u0027re trapped in an echo chamber in which their guiding motivation is ideological conformity.\n\nIn the U.S. we tend to focus on personal achievement over community acceptance. Misanthropes who are masters of their craft are admired, and material wealth is the goal. This is the end result of the puritan work ethic that we started with, devoid of its religious message.\n\nCombine individualism and materialism with technology and you have generations of people who don\u0027t care about the larger community, admire disruptive innovators, and have access to so much information that skepticism is the default state. To be clear here, this is not rational, reasoned skepticism, but the cynical, irrational dismissal of new ideas regardless of their truth-value.\n\nIf we want to de-fang the more extreme Muslim ideologies, then we need to change their primary motivations. Education, access to information, and the seduction of personal wealth, in other words.\n\nIn simple, ELI5 terms: put a McDonalds on every corner, open up a hundred malls, provide education and internet access, and give it two generations. \n\nTO BE CLEAR: I\u0027m not saying their culture is inferior (in some vague, ill-defined way) to ours. I\u0027m saying that in our culture, we tend to run (or walk) towards excess, obesity, aggressive personal promotion and virulent opinion. However, despite (or because of) all of our failings, ideologies that advocate disruption of the status quo and *actual* wholesale violence tend to waste away rather quickly here.

Of course you have to go to 3rd world countries for a comparison because  (how many gays and witches have been killed in the last 5 years BTW?) it\u0027s difficult to identify and compare any religious country or groups (1st world, secular based, modern) that has committed the atrocities of modern (within the last 10- 15 years) day fundamentalism Islam","duration":"","id":206,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_coddph8","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":178,"links":[1],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"basec0m","label":"Yeah, those christians dropping bombs from planes, drones, etc. over there aren\u0027t violent at all.","duration":"","id":178,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_codb2gy","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"flexx0325","label":"Christian violence WAS just as bad as muslim violence today.

That being said, all religious inspired violence is abhorrent and not to be justified or tolerated.\n\nFrom the article: [Ignoring Christian Violence Isn’t Very Christian](http://thinkprogress.org/world/2015/02/06/3620402/ignoring-christian-violence-isnt-very-christian/):\n\n\u0026gt; ...The first — that violence committed in the name of Christ is somehow exempt from criticism because it happened in the past — ignores history and reality. Like it or not, horrendous torture happened during the Inquisition and the era of slavery, both of which were justified using biblical scripture. And the argument that the Crusades — which resulted in the deaths of untold thousands — were only in response to Muslim provocation is highly contested among historians.\nMore importantly, while these events are long past, these critics are apparently tone deaf to the numerous modern examples of violence perpetrated by people claiming to represent Christ. In 2011, Anders Behring Breivik, a self-professed Christian, launched a horrific assault in Oslo, Norway to defend “Christian Europe,” using an arsenal of weapons to kill 77 people — most of whom were teenagers. In November of last year, suspected Christian terrorist Larry McQuilliams mounted a full-scale attack on Austin, Texas, firing off more than 100 shots in the city before embarking on a botched attempt to burn down the Mexican Consulate. And in central Africa, the Lord’s Resistance Army (which, similar to ISIS, seeks to establish a theocratic state based on the Ten Commandments) forcibly recruits child soldiers, terrorizes local villages, and is thought to be responsible for the deaths of 100,000 people in Uganda and the displacement of 1.7 million in the greater region, according to the United Nations.\nOne wonders if Jackson and others would be so willing to “defend” Christianity’s apparently sinless history to the faces of those 60,000 to 100,000 child soldiers, youngsters who were ripped from their homes, tortured brutally, and forced by the LRA to run needlessly into battle — all ostensibly in the name of Christ.","duration":"","id":406,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_codnyzf","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Obama Is Right: Christian Violence Is Just as Bad as Muslim Violence—Or Worse","label":"spaceghoti","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_2v01jp","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.423271335E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.423300188E9,"simScore":0.7394685870772324,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":407,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"mysticreddit","label":"Uh, violence is violence.

These instances of barbarism that we see in throughout Catholic history are at odds with the scripture, fundamentally. The Gospels uabashadly describe the birth of a new religion which began with the teachings of Jesus and his disciples. The Bible its self lays out the evolution the philosophy of Christianity. In the Gospels Jesus references old scripture, basically saying it is out of date while offering a new methodology for governing ones own affairs and that of society at large.\n\nThe Q\u0027uran does not make offer such internal abrogation or relinquishing of archaic ideals. Instead the Q\u0027uran is practiced with strict Infallibility from front to back.

Did their supernatural beliefs change at that time? Why isn\u0027t terrorism more of a problem in all Muslim countries relative to all non-Muslim countries, and why not all the time going as far back as we have data? In fact, data suggests that the center of terrorism appears to have moved, in my lifetime, from Latin America to the muslim world, while the overall religious affiliation of both regions has stayed the same.

It\u0027s stupid not to confront this issue head on, call a bullshitter a bullshitter. There is a large proportion of Muslims who believe in fairly hard line punishments, and archaic thoughts. Sam Harris did a study on this, and he estimated conservatively that something like 20% of Muslims were conservative or Islamist, which when you put into perspective is 20% of 1.6 Billion. \nWhat Obama\u0027s saying is a waste of air.
