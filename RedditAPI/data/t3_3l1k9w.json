There are rules for immigration, designed to ensure that only those who can best contribute to the country and it\u0027s economic situation are allowed in.\n\nAs a fun little exercise, lets draw an analogy between immigration and drivers licenses.  Jim is seventeen, he\u0027s taken drivers ed and knows the basics WRT the rules of the road.  He takes his test and recieves a drivers license.  John, on the other hand, has never taken a drivers education course, knows nothing about the rules of the road, and yet harbors the belief that he\u0027s just as good as Jim and every bit as deserving as Jim of being able to drive.\n\nNever mind that John knows nothing about driving, the responsibilities of driving, or even the absolute basics of the rules of the road.  But since he fervently believes that he deserves a drivers license, regardless of his qualifications, he expects to get a drivers license.\n\nThe reason that people don\u0027t want illegal immigrants to enter their country is simple.  They are apparently unable to demonstrate to the powers that be that they can be beneficial to the host country.  Failing that, they believe that their simple desire to live somewhere better than where they currently are is somehow enough to entitle them to live wherever they wish, and if the people who were already there don\u0027t like it, too fucking bad, because I want what I want and I\u0027m going to get it.\n\nThe case against illegal immigration is easy to boil down to it\u0027s roots.  Despite the fact that nobody hired you, you\u0027ve decided that you now work at FooBar Incorperated.  You\u0027re doing work and you expect to be paid.  It doesn\u0027t matter that you hired yourself, and the HR policies of the company you chose to latch on to are irrelevant.  Any attempt to dislodge you, for instance by the company administration protesting that you seem to have hired yourself, is simply racisim and \"mind boggling hate.\"  It doesn\u0027t matter that no one wanted you to work there, you decided that you should and then went ahead and hired yourself.","duration":"","id":134,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_cv32hlg","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":5,"links":[4],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"fundayz","label":"Yeah I used to think Trump running was a joke, and I still do to an extent, but he actually has some good points.\n\nUnfortunately he is still off his rocker on many other issues.","duration":"","id":5,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_cv2fwtb","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":4,"links":[3],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Ghost42","label":"He was, but he was still very much an establishment candidate who took money from whomever would give it to him.

For a long long time, the GOP has been a coalition of old-school laissez-faire economics and pro-business policies, wedded to populist, evangelical conservative positions on a lot of social issues (the most important being guns, abortion, and immigration, but it also includes things like gay marriage). The GOP fundraising machine is overwhelmingly supported by the former group, but the fieldwork and the actual votes come from the latter. Regardless, it has proven to be an effective and resilient electoral coalition for many years. \n\nThe problem is, Trump has exposed the fact that the balance of power has shifted within the party to such an extent that the voters now care far more about guns, abortion, and immigration than they do about the economic issues that have been the core of the party\u0027s actual legislative policy for decades. And this has royally fucked up the party leadership. There\u0027s now potential for their entire base to be scooped up by an independent candidate willing to go really far to the right on the social issues that the money machine couldn\u0027t care less about, but also be a centrist on a bunch of economic policies that the money machine actually DOES care about. \n\nPeople have been predicting a breakdown of the GOP along exactly this faultline for years, since at least 2006, but now that there\u0027s an actual candidate willing to fuck over the establishment and take advantage of this schism, and who has the resources to do basically whatever he wants as far as campaigning goes, I think we might finally see the long-predicted breakdown start to happen.","duration":"","id":277,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_cv2t5hy","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":2,"links":[1],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"aumenous","label":"Trump is a chimera dripping with political weirdness, but at least his personal wealth insulates him from the usual conservative pandering to wealthy donors.","duration":"","id":2,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cv2fgou","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"petergibbons2","label":"Trump is going to absolutely kill Bush on these tax cuts in the debate.

My concern with Trump actually spawns from this, to some extent. Trump has *been* the wealthy donor in many past elections, and his rise to popularity has been primarily through stardom, through corporate enterprising and through contentious PR. More importantly, his rise has been in no way officially political. He is not an office holder, or a policy maker. He\u0027s a corporate head.\n\nBy entering the presidential race and doing so well on these criteria alone, Trump is signaling to the corporate world, that the republican party is prepared to open up to the image of the blatant corporate defender, and the proponent of deterioration of nationalist power, with implicit endorsement of corporate power as its substitute. I know that\u0027s a mouthful, so broken down, Trump\u0027s candidacy is a signal that non-political individuals can and should run for presidency.\n\nThere\u0027s nothing in our laws that has ever prevented that, and this could be seen as good if the right people took advantage of it. Maybe the \"rent is too damn high\" guy will have a chance now /s. However, with Trump as the spearhead of this movement, and the movement emerging from the corporate side of political engagement, the more important signal from this is the decline of national statesmanship as a crucial criteria for candidacy. That\u0027s one of the tenets of a republic that I like, and I think is important. Developing people as policy makers and organizers is crucial for them to make decisions that at the very least, weigh the public interest against private ones.

He\u0027s also honest about wanting to deport 11 million illegals. Honest about a lot of his right wing ideas.

They secretly release myths, spout falsities, lie about their intentions, and sell failed policies like tax cuts. They make themselves sound like the greatest thing since Reagan, but when it comes to their intentions, they are a Nixon.\n  \nLeft wing has the issue to.

How many jobs and opportunities for others could you create?\n\nHe\u0027s actually talking about the tax rates paid by the highest earners who pay %39.6 of their income, which he will lower to 15%. Those \"hedge guys\" he says are going to take a hit, are actually getting a huge windfall. So, where are we actually going to get the money to pay for shit from? My guess is his answer is service cuts and privatization. I guarantee the military isn\u0027t going to be included in those cuts either.","duration":"","id":481,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_cv2xp5m","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":480,"links":[479],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"WilburWright","label":"Trump is for higher taxes for the top 1%, so I\u0027m not sure you can call him a poster boy for modern conservatism\n","duration":"","id":480,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_cv2x9je","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":479,"links":[471],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"CylonbabyLiam","label":"Trump is the icon of American capitalism and has a vested interest in shifting the power paradigm into the hands of multi-national corporations.

North Carolina had some of the most progressive election laws in the country. Since 2000, they had expanded early voting. They had allowed same-day voter registration during the early voting period. They had passed pre-registration for 16 and 17-year-olds, so young people could get a jump on participating in the political process. They allowed you to vote anywhere in a county. All of these reforms had a huge impact on voter turnout.\n\n\u0026gt; North Carolina moved from 37th in voter turnout in 2000 to 11th in voter turnout by 2012. **And what Republicans did is they essentially targeted all of those reforms. They cut early voting. They eliminated same-day registration. They eliminated pre-registration for 16 and 17-year-olds. They mandated strict voter ID.** And all of this was in one bill. And what we had seen in other states, like Texas and Florida and Wisconsin, is that they had done some things to try to restrict voting rights. They had passed a voter ID law, or they had shut down voter registration drives, or they had purged the voting rules.

There was some study that came out in the past year or two that I\u0027m too lazy to look up that showed that the number of families that break the $10M threshold without enough liquidity to pay the tax is *extremely* miniscule.

If you punish (with fat taxes) these situations, they won\u0027t occur as frequently (if at all).\n\nYeah, this isn\u0027t true. Nobody is going to look at even a relatively high tax (like 30-40%) and think \"Welp, now it\u0027s just not worth it.\" This is just another conservative talking point with no basis. There probably is a threshold where this happens in the same way that the laffer curve has a peak that lowers government revenue once taxes get too high. But just as marginal rates are nowhere near that point of the laffer curve (according to most economists), a 30-40% inheritance tax is also nowhere near that point.","duration":"","id":684,"color":"black","redditID":"t1_cv2lu2i","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":683,"links":[682],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"s-c","label":"Someone has to play the devils advocate.

I have experienced living in cities that the avg cost of a 1bd apartment goes for about 1k a month in rent, while jobs pay an average of 1200 a month. These employers know the cost of living and while they make tons of profits, they have most of their employees below poverty, cause no one can afford to live independently. I use to make 4 times what I make today 10 years ago. It kills any motivation to do better, when you feel there is no hope. Something must change.

Through the marginal structure, you pay the rate for a tax bracket on the income you make in that bracket such that when your total income puts you in a higher bracket you pay the rate specified for the lower bracket on the income made in that bracket and then you pay the higher rate of the higher tax bracket on the income made in the higher bracket.\n\nThus, everybody\u0027s first X dollars gets taxed at the same rate.

Consider the person whose next dollar puts him into a higher tax bracket: if the tax rate increase affected every dollar he\u0027d earned previously, he would possibly lose money because his income increased; however, because of the marginal tax structure, he continues to pay the same rate he had been paying in his initial tax bracket but he pays at a higher rate on the money he\u0027s making in his new tax bracket.\n\nSo, how would you lower taxes in a manner not disproportionately favoring the rich and do so while lowering income taxes for everyone?

I\u0027m at least glad that Jeb recognizes the need for spending reductions under a plan like this and he isn\u0027t prescribing to the \"tax cuts increase revenue\" delusions, but the discretionary cuts that will be needed to sustain his new tax system would devastate the economy and defund or underfund a lot of vital parts of our society. Jeb Bush\u0027s plan is extremely reckless in that sense. It\u0027s become obvious that we need to increase funding for a lot of things like transportation for example. Tax cuts won\u0027t rebuild a bridge, or a road.
