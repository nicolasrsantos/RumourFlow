I believe that if you are going to make that woman have that child you should make adoption easier and direct more couples to it, anti-poverty initiatives to give kids like that a better chance, increase education spending for inner-city and rual schools in order to give those children youve saved a better chance a success, put a stop to wars so that the preditation of the working class by military recruiters wont get them killed. oromote job programs and wage raises in order to help break the poverty cycle so that way when presented with the choice, potential mothers will chose life because they are able to take care of the child or give it up for adoption.
