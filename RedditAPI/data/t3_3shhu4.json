Here’s what Oliver [said](http://oliverwillis.com/2008/05/08/hillary-white-power-clinton/) in 2008:\n\n\u0026gt; “[W]orking, hard-working Americans, white Americans”. She really said that. Wow.\n\n\u0026gt; Congratulations, Hillary Clinton, you win the prize for the first Democratic Bigot Eruption since I’ve been keeping track of this. Even professional haters like Pat Buchanan and his ilk aren’t so balls-out about racism. You’ve been getting your ass handed to you and especially among black voters. This shows me once again that we – who are apparently lazy and shiftless non-Americans based on your definition – have yet again been a leading indicator.\n\n[Eugene Robinson](https://twitter.com/Eugene_Robinson) gave his opinion [here:]( http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/08/AR2008050802807.html?hpid%3Dopinionsbox1\u0026amp;sub\u003dAR)\n\n\u0026gt; As a rationale for why Democratic Party superdelegates should pick her over Obama, it\u0027s a slap in the face to the party\u0027s most loyal constituency -- African Americans -- and a repudiation of principles the party claims to stand for. Here\u0027s what she\u0027s really saying to party leaders: There\u0027s no way that white people are going to vote for the black guy. Come November, you\u0027ll be sorry.\n\nThe New York Times editorial board [weighed in](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/09/opinion/09fri1.html) (bear in mind, they endorsed Clinton):\n\n\u0026gt; But we believe just as strongly that Mrs. Clinton will be making a terrible mistake — for herself, her party and for the nation — if she continues to press her candidacy through negative campaigning with disturbing racial undertones.\n\n\n\n**ON BILL CLINTON’S “KID” AND “FAIRY TALE” COMMENTS**\n\nThis was Bill Clinton’s [most notorious moment](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/08/bill_clinton/) of the 2008 campaign:\n\n\u0026gt; “It is wrong that Sen. Obama got to go through 15 debates trumpeting his superior judgment and how he had been against the war in every year, enumerating the years, and never got asked one time — not once, ‘Well, how could you say that when you said in 2004 you didn’t know how you would have voted on the resolution? You said in 2004 there was no difference between you and George Bush on the war. And you took that speech you’re now running on off your Web site in 2004. And there’s no difference in your voting record and Hillary’s ever since.’ Give me a break. This whole thing is the biggest fairy tale I’ve ever seen.”\n\nThis is what [Donna Brazile](https://twitter.com/donnabrazile) [said](http://www.politico.com/blogs/ben-smith/2008/01/brazile-on-bill-depressing-005184) about Bill Clinton’s aggressive campaigning against Obama after Obama won Iowa:\n\n\u0026gt; I could understand his frustration at this moment. But, look, he shouldn\u0027t take out all his pain on Barack Obama. It\u0027s time that they regroup. Figure out what Hillary needs to do to get her campaign back on track. It sounds like sour grapes coming from the former commander in chief. Someone that many Democrats hold in high esteem. For him to go after Obama, using a fairy tale, calling him as he did last week. It\u0027s an insult. And I will tell you, as an African-American, I find his tone and his words to be very depressing.\n\n**FEAR MONGERING OVER OBAMA’S RELIGION**\n\nThe Clinton campaign [circulated](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/02/25/obama-camp-slams-clinton-team-on-controversial-photo/) an image of Obama in a turban:\n\n\u0026gt; Barack Obama’s campaign accused Hillary Clinton’s team Monday of circulating a photo of the Illinois senator donning traditional attire – clothing worn by area Muslims – as a goodwill gesture during an overseas trip.\n\n\u0026gt; In a statement, the Clinton campaign called the charge “an obvious and transparent attempt to distract” voters from serious issues – but did not issue a denial.\n\n\u0026gt; The picture, which appeared on the Drudge Report this morning, was attributed to sources within the Clinton campaign – although the Web site did not reveal how many, or who, might have received the photo.\n\nOne of the most notorious moments for Clinton though was her [“as far as I know”](http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/03/clinton-says-ob.html) moment when commenting on Obama’s religion:\n\n\u0026gt; STEVE KROFT: You don\u0027t believe that Senator Obama\u0027s a Muslim?\nHILLARY CLINTON: Of course not. I mean that\u0027s, you know, that, there is no basis for that. You know, I take him on the basis of what he says, and, you know, there isn\u0027t any reason to doubt that.\nKROFT: You said you take Sen. Obama at his word that he\u0027s not a Muslim...\nCLINTON: Right, right..\nKROFT: …you don\u0027t believe that he\u0027s a Muslim.\nCLINTON: No! No! Why would I? There\u0027s nothing to base that on. As far as I know.\n\n\n**TRIVIALIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF BLACK CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS**\n\nFrom [January 2008:](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/us/politics/13cnd-campaign.html?pagewanted\u003dall)\n\n\u0026gt; Mrs. Clinton made the remark last Monday as part of her latest political argument that Mr. Obama was an eloquent speaker but not a proven force for change, a description she is applying to herself.\n\n\u0026gt; “I would point to the fact that that Dr. King’s dream began to be realized when President Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, when he was able to get through Congress something that President Kennedy was hopeful to do, the president before had not even tried, but it took a president to get it done,” she said. “That dream became a reality, the power of that dream became real in people’s lives because we had a president who said we are going to do it and actually got it accomplished.”\n\n\n**OTHER EXAMPLES OF CLINTON’S CAMPAIGN EXPLOITING DIVISION**\n\nA Clinton superdelegate, U.S. Rep. Rob Andrews, [disclosed](http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/topstories/index.ssf/2008/06/andrews_says_he_heard_racist_s.html) that he received a call from the Clinton campaign where the campaign planned to exploit division between African Americans and Jews:\n\n\u0026gt; U.S. Rep. Rob Andrews, who supported Hillary Clinton throughout the primary season, disclosed he received a phone call shortly before the April 22 Pennsylvania primary from a top member of Clinton\u0027s organization and that the caller explicitly discussed a strategy of winning over Jewish voters by exploiting tensions between Jews and African-Americans.\n\n\u0026gt; \"There have been signals coming out of the Clinton campaign that have racial overtones that indeed disturb me,\" Andrews said at his campaign headquarters in Cherry Hill Tuesday night after he lost his bid for the Democratic U.S. Senate nomination.\n\n\u0026gt; \"Frankly, I had a private conversation with a high-ranking person in the campaign ... that used a racial line of argument that I found very disconcerting. It was extremely disconcerting given the rank of this person. It was very disturbing.\"\n\nGeraldine Ferraro, the first woman vice presidential candidate in the U.S. and a Clinton surrogate, [said](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/03/11/ferraros-remarks-about-ob_n_91008.html) that Obama would not be as successful in his campaign if he weren’t black (Clinton distanced herself from these comments, but still):\n\n\u0026gt; Ferraro told the Daily Breeze of Torrance, Calif.: \"If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position. And if he was a woman (of any color) he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept.\"\n\nAnd while Clinton did not embrace Mark Penn’s strategy of [painting Obama as un-American](http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/13/nation/na-clinton13), let’s be clear, that strategy was discussed in March 2007 and Clinton STILL kept him as part of her brain trust until April 2008.\n\n\u0026gt; In a March 2007 memo to the candidate, Mark Penn, a longtime pollster and strategist for the Clintons, urged the New York senator\u0027s campaign to paint Barack Obama as \"fundamentally\" foreign.\n\n\u0026gt; Clinton never embraced that theme, preferring instead to cast Obama as untested and too inexperienced to be commander in chief. But the memo shows the range of options being considered as Obama\u0027s campaign gained momentum at Clinton\u0027s expense.\n\n\u0026gt; The Penn paper is part of a sheaf of e-mails and documents obtained by the Atlantic and made available on the magazine’s website.\n\n\u0026gt; The March 19, 2007, memo included a section titled \"Lack of American Roots,\" in which Penn recommended making an issue of Obama\u0027s \"diverse, multicultural\" upbringing. Obama was born in Hawaii and spent part of his childhood in Indonesia before returning to Hawaii to live with his grandparents.\n\n\u0026gt; Obama\u0027s \"roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited,\" Penn wrote. \"I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and his values.\"\n\n\u0026gt; To avoid an overt attack, Penn recommended emphasizing the word \"American\" in Clinton\u0027s various campaign messages -- drawing a contrast to Obama but in subtler form.\n\n---\n\nDemocratic voters have, for the most part, given her a pass on this history. Most likely because they want to put the unity of the party first and believe that Obama making her Secretary of State essentially made this primary water under the bridge. \n\nOne of the main reasons I am with Bernie is because I\u0027ve seen the worst of how Clinton campaigns. It\u0027s ugly as hell.","selftextHTML":"\u0026lt;!-- SC_OFF --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div class\u003d\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I know there are a lot of first time voters in this subreddit, and there might be people who have forgotten the ugly extent to which the Clinton 2008 campaign tried to negatively portray Obama.
