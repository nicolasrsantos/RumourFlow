Are other major news organizations not liberal per se? Is that a false statement? \n\nPersonally I don\u0027t watch much news. I like online sources better, because they\u0027re more fluid, and there are more options. I can read an article about something on the BBC, then find something about it in the Guardian, and maybe even the NYT or The Blaze. Hell, there\u0027s even Al Jazeera. There\u0027s a lot of options out there to cross-reference news with these days. On top of the news outlets you can use corresponding websites. Say you\u0027re reading something about the economy, and you decide to check it; you can google the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \n\nAnd you saying Fox \"news\" isn\u0027t news applies to all national (and some international) news agencies. It\u0027s not about facts anymore, it\u0027s about ratings. So why don\u0027t you stop putting words in my mouth? Hmmm? Sounds good to you? Because I never said Fox is news, anymore so than any other major outlet. While they may (all news organizations being referenced here) run some stores of relevance, and at least give you something to look into, they\u0027re all flawed.
