Bush won the popular vote by 2.5%, and the electoral vote by 35. The vote was not decided until Kerry conceded Ohio the morning after and winning the state would have tipped the election.\n\nSo given the amount of conspiracies and manipulation attributed to the Bush administration, this situation seems RIPE for the deployment of some fake evidence. And remember, in Powell\u0027s presentation to the UN, he showed satellite photos showing that the bioweapons program was mobile, and conducted in trailers. It doesn\u0027t seem like it would be hard to fake evidence- just find a Winnebago in the desert, point to some test tubes, and say they tested positive for anthrax. Or hire some Arab dudes in lab coats to say they ran a WMD program. Or point some clicking Geiger counters at some machinery and say it\u0027s radioactive. \n\nYet there was none of this, and cooking up this evidence would have been MUCH simpler than nearly all of the other conspiracies found on this page.  Foreign policy and the Iraq was was the main issue in the \u002704 election, and had that happened Bush would have likely won in a landslide, rather than such a slim margin.","duration":"","id":4,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_c547tyg","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"lexlightning","label":"Both a bio-weapons program and nuclear program would involve a huge amount of infra-structure and personnel; a hard thing to fake and  engineer in a short amount of time post invasion. \n\nI think the real reason is that after the power-coup that was 911, the power-cabal-in-charge no longer had any fear of a reprisal of any kind [political, legal or in the controlled media] so they didn\u0027t really bother to come-up with any evidence as evidence is no longer necessary.","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c53gpiq","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Let\u0027s discuss the LACK of a conspiracy: Why didn\u0027t the Bush administration fake WMD evidence after the invasion?","label":"eveverything","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_vczfx","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.340272671E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.340284488E9,"simScore":0.6713570001178856,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.34042437E9,"simScore":0.6675021715653311,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":5,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"sovereignman","label":"They tried but got caught smuggling them into Iraq.

You could also add Israel to that list.   Saddam had to purchase whole systems or components from abroad to do that,  and the US and its allies were his main sponsor until the Kuwait war.   Of course after Kuwait,  it was more difficult to sell anything to Iraq.   But if Russia or China had provided key systems,  it would be up to the CIA,  NSA,  Cheney,  Wolfowitz and others on whether it was actually strategically necessary or desireable to point the finger at them at that time.    My main contention is that the disclosure of finding WMD in Iraq post 9/11 was neither strategically necessary or desirable.    Thousands of road side bombs based on US explosives should make it clear that the country was packed to the gills with US sourced munitions.   The makers of these munitions along with Wall Street have a disproportionate say in what goes official and what doesn\u0027t.  \n\nAfter Kuwait and especially after 9/11 Saddam was not allowed to tell his side of the story.   Eventually he was captured,  imprisoned,  and murdered,  during which time the media did not translate or broadcasts his unedited statements.   If you have a better source for his statements during his \"trial\" (what a joke),  I would love to see it.\n\nAccording to US military sources,  Osama had been treated at a well known hospital and had also been surrounded in Tora Bora.    In both cases,  the US military was redirected to provide Osama clear means of exit.   In addition,  communications attributed to Osama following 9/11 have been the subject of much good analysis.   Certain videos and tapes have either been fabricated or edited in order to serve the US agenda.   The official post 9/11 life of Osama is largely a fairy tale in my opinion,  and the story of Osama\u0027s capture,  murder,  and burial at sea is dubious at best.   \n\nAlternative sleuthing is an esoteric art that clearly resides on the wrong side of the rail road tracks,  surrounded by unsavory and ill motivated associations.  It is rarely publicly vindicated,  but its adherents find their reward in not having drunk the official kool aid,  and in those occasional releases such as Gulf of Tonkin and Operation Northwoods.    Credible witnesses and researchers have also come forward on the issues of the second Iraq War,  Anthrax,  9/11,  the assassinations of MLK,  JFK,  RFK,  the death of Osama etc. etc.   Its a jungle out there,  but I suggest you step \"outside of the beltway\" if you want to start finding out what is going on.\n\nEdit:  Second guessing the policy choices of the inner circle in DC and Wall Street without a seat at the table has its limitations for both the conspiracy minded and government apologists.   Over time,  the 9/11 fairy tales,  the Iraq War fairy tales,  etc. become less and less believable.    The power of spin starts wearing off and new facts come to light.    I like your post questioning the handing of the WMD story,  and I do not know the answer.   Someone could suddenly \"FIND\" old WMD in Iraq a week before the upcoming elections in November.   Information is a political weapon,  so how it is used is not always clear,  and if it is ever made clear,  it is after the passage of a substantial amount of time.
