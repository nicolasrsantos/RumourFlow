These relationships include political contributions, political approval for defense spending, lobbying to support bureaucracies, and beneficial legislation and oversight of the industry.

Cases of political corruption have also surfaced with regularity.\n\nNo conspiracy is necessary since \"[iron traingles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_triangle_%28US_politics%29)\" can arise quite naturally in the political and economic environment that we have.","duration":"","id":22,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_c1djrx4","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":21,"links":[20],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"eternalkerri","label":"I never said you can\u0027t post them, but you have to make sure that when you are presenting things that are incendiary, you watch the words you are using, and you make sure your facts are rock solid.\n\nprison planet is not a viable source.  democracy now would be a better one, crooks and liers would serve if taken with a grain of salt, and politifact.com would be best, , but anything that the likes of Alex Jones, the political George Noory, touches is extremely dubious.
