Here\u0027s the full exchange. \n\nBUSH: My aspiration for the country and I believe we can achieve it, is 4 percent growth as far as the eye can see. Which means we have to be a lot more productive, workforce participation has to rise from its all-time modern lows. It means that people need to work longer hours and, through their productivity, gain more income for their families. That\u0027s the only way we\u0027re going to get out of this rut that we\u0027re in.\n\nQUESTION: To keep us from taking it out of context, what you meant to say — when you say more hours you mean full-time work.\n\nBUSH: Given the opportunity to work. Yeah, absolutely.\n\nQUESTION: Not that a full time guy or somebody working two jobs needs to be working even more time.\n\nBUSH: Absolutely not. Their incomes need to grow. It’s not going to grow in an environment where the costs of doing business are so extraordinarily high here. Health care costs are rising. In many places the cost of doing business is extraordinarily high and the net result of that is that business start up rates are at an all time low. Work force participation rates are low. If anyone is celebrating this anemic recovery, then they are totally out of touch. The simple fact is people are really struggling. So giving people a chance to work longer hours has got to be part of the answer. If not, you are going to see people lose hope. And that’s where we are today.\n\n","duration":"","id":330,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_csxxxdn","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"adam_anarchist","label":"ignoring

It\u0027s not craigslist, it\u0027s because if you\u0027re shopping there, *you can afford it*. Buying that sort of stuff for the 1%(or .01%, whatever) is like your shopping at the mall - yeah that 30,000 acre island might be a bit pricey, but a month later you\u0027ll either be fine with it or you can return it.\n\nIf you want to have dinner with someone, you just say so - you don\u0027t even make a call, they do it. If you want to see an event, you already have a private box with free food and drink for you and your friends. If you make an oopsie somewhere and break the law, you can hire the best lawyers from that country, or better ones from somewhere else. If you don\u0027t have anything to do with your life, you can start a charity in a month and watch it grow like your fishtank, or have someone do some work on your behalf for a friend\u0027s company if you want a notch on your resume. If you want to drive you can do it in a Lambo, if you\u0027re feeling sluggish you already have someone else to do it for you. You can be famous if you want, but if nobody knows who you are nobody will check in, and you can just do whatever you want. \n\nSome actors and famous people have \"fuck you\" money.

Then dismissed Viral12\u0027s comment as an emotional appeal, and then totally just ignored A_600lb_Tunafish\u0027s sources, by proceeding to move goalposts to be about how income disparity isn\u0027t bad, where A_600lb_Tunafish agreed that income dispairty isn\u0027t bad and is in fact good.\n\nThe thing about everyone picking apart that part of your argument is that your entire argument hinges on it and it\u0027s completely wrong. You even say, \n\n\u0026gt;**If** people made enough, why would the top also making most of the money be bad? Why is the disparity inherently bad?\n\n**The problem is that people don\u0027t make enough and so the disparity has gotten to the point that it is bad.**\n\nSo let me lay it all out for you. In a society where people make enough, income dispairity isn\u0027t bad. So it isn\u0027t inherently bad. The issue is that people don\u0027t make enough and so it is bad in our current siutation.\n\nAt this point I\u0027m assuming you just want to argue, because even when someone tries to agree with you, you come up with a way to disagree. And now I\u0027m just realizing that you\u0027re probably just a troll since you\u0027re deliberately misunderstanding everyone that responds to you. Whatever, feel free to completely misconstrue everything I\u0027ve said. \n\nIn case you\u0027re not a troll and you\u0027re just legitimately confused. I\u0027m sorry for being an asshole, I hope I\u0027ve made things a bit clearer to you, and have a nice day.","duration":"","id":873,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_csxwnft","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":872,"links":[871],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Cyralea","label":"\u0026gt; Comically disproportionate wealth inequality is not normal, it is not healthy.

A millionaire is successful a billionaire can hold a private meeting with a governor or senator on a whim. \n  Further the billionaire with more power can work to redefine or at least change the framework of a \"a basic lifestyle\".  Lastly from and economic standpoint when wealth resides in just a few economic competition diminishes and a system of rents (not innovation) emerges.  If I already am the top my incentive is to just institutionalize my way of doing things since I am the economic powerhouse.  This leads to absurd ideas like 120 year patents?  Or other intellectual property in essence simply taxing people (often in the disguise of free trade).  Lastly it abstracts wealth to a large degree,  in that financial services (not simply business loans or basic banking) reap huge returns in growth of GDP but do little actual tangible benefit to society.  They are not doctors helping people,  or construction workers building a house,  instead they are abstract system of paperwork and contracts that redistribute wealth primarily to the top.\n","duration":"","id":877,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_csxtzsp","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":876,"links":[875],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Cyralea","label":"\u0026gt; So I agree there is no reason for income to be equal but ultra historic disparity threatens belief in our system\n\nSo income inequality isn\u0027t bad, but lots of it is?

So now you have 2 happy, productive employees and not 1 employee who never leaves work? That also means less unemployment. \n\nAnd my response: \n\n\u0026gt; This is pretty much it.\n\n\u0026gt; It\u0027s the opposite of what Bush said.\n\n\u0026gt; We need more people working 35-40 hours per week, not less people working 48 hours per week.\n\n\u0026gt; Only 62.6% are working, and those people are working very long hours. If they were cut hours and made the same amount of money, productivity should shoot up like it is in Finland where the average is 39 hours per week.\n\n\u0026gt; Cutting the average work week from 48 to 40 hours would increase workforce participation from 62.6% to 70%. Which would put us at almost the same as Finland\u0027s 73.8% workforce participation. What would you fucking know? It\u0027s insane how dumb these politicians are. Or good at lying, I guess.\n\n\u0026gt; Obviously this will cost companies more money, but it\u0027s clearly working better for other developed nations.\n\nTo add, increasing workforce participation from 62.6% to 70% is almost 20 million jobs.\n\nAnd many studies have shown that working people an additional 25% or 50% hours (50 or 60 instead of 40) doesn\u0027t give half as much of a productivity increase.  It\u0027s more efficient to have more workers working 30-40 hours, but because people are salaried or because people working 30 hours need another job working 20 hours somewhere else, things don\u0027t work out that way in America.","duration":"","id":934,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_csxq2iq","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Sanders to Bush: Americans need better wages not longer hours: Sanders says America’s problem is not work ethic but income inequality.","label":"maglevnarwhal","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_3cowe6","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.436487688E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.436497422E9,"simScore":0.7148769228114871,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":935,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"verneasimov","label":"Probably too late for this but I posted this in the Jeb Bush thread:\n\n\u0026gt; * Productivity is measured at GDP per hour worked.
