Especially in metropolitan areas where most of Muslims live in. Also in USA people in general have more opportunities to build a living from scratch. In contrast here in Europe most countries are very nationalistic. And there is a stronger division between us and them. Here in Holland we even have a word for it autochtoon\u003d ethnic dutch, allochtoon\u003d immigrant dutch citizens. The immigrants are usually in a vicious cycle from day one. For example:\n\nA Syrian couple moves to Holland as refugees. They live here a few decades and get Dutch citizenship eventually. But all those decades they weren\u0027t allowed to work or to study, they just lived in a refugee camp basically doing nothing. So now they are citizens and they need to find a job and move out of the camp. Usually they cant speak Dutch well enough to compete on the job market and usually they don\u0027t have proper education. So they work as cleaners in school and hospitals and such. Get a minimum pay and live in minimum conditions. They get children who hear Syrian at home and have trouble learning Dutch from day one. At primary education they quickly fall behind their Dutch co-students. When at age 12 every child has to do a CITO test and the result determines to which secondary school you will go. Most immigrant children have trouble at school, because of their language issues caused by their situation at home and so have trouble keeping up the pace in other classes as well. So most of the immigrant kids get sent to VMBO which is a school for \"stupid\" kids. Officially it is not, but here in Holland everyone knows what VMBO is, who goes there, and no Dutch parent wants his kid to go there. So when kids end up in VMBO they start to develop an inferiority complex. Parents often talk about their kids and passively shame the ones who\u0027s kids arent performing as well. That if they are willing to talk to you at all.\nDrop out is quite high in VMBO, because many kids feel like it has no point, they are stupid and VMBO diploma is worthless, so there is no point trying. A very poisonous environment.\nBut lets say they manage to finish VMBO which lasts four years and get to go to college what options do they have there? Well right now the job market overall is very bad in Holland. Even with University degree its hard to find a job. So to find a good job with VMBO diploma is nearly impossible. Especially with the Polish work migrants willing to work very cheaply. For their levels of pay you can simply not live in Holland, but it is more than enough to send back to family in Poland. So the Syrian kid goes to MBO which is a college where options are very limited, you can become a hairdresser, or simple mechanics or administrator and such. With VMBO diploma you do not have access to University. If you want to become a doctor or a lawyer, nope. All of those jobs that you can study for at MBO are rather low end, and everyone knows it. So motivation is a huge struggle especially for the immigrants. Some Dutch kids have this mentality: \"I wanna be a garbageman, that is my dream!\" In Holland we try to promote this way of thinking but it is rare that young adults truly think like this, especially among immigrants. \n\nBut lets say you have successfully graduated from MBO and you are applying to over 100 companies every week and none of them even invites you to an interview. Why? because 1) your diploma is worthless, 2) there are ethnic Dutch who speak the language better than you with same or better diploma\u0027s 3) just because they don\u0027t want an immigrant in their office. And all this time through you hear that you are not trying hard enough, you are too lazy, you and people from Syria are all lazy and are a burden on Dutch society, you hear radical politicians say Islam is the religion of hatred and all Muslims must be deported and then you see that guy\u0027s party getting a huge amount of seats in the Parliament. So you start feeling like the whole society is against you and you start feeling unwanted even more and depressed, and the longer this continues the more you start to cluster within yourself or with people like you, other immigrants with no opportunities in life as well. So you all start poisoning each others mind further on about how there is no future for you. To fight this depression you start reading Koran a lot, go to the mosques trying to find god and get rid of this horrible feelings that thrives inside you. And the more you do this the more the Dutch society condemns you, they call you a radical, they call your people terrorists. You feel isolated, you want to matter, you want to contribute, but they don\u0027t want you here. So you pack your bags and go back to Syria. There, there is purpose, there is a goal, there you can belong to something, there you can make a change, you can matter. And so you land in Syria to fight for the freedom fighters, that turn out to be crazy fucked up psychopaths, but there is no way back now, back in Holland you are now a terrorist.","duration":"","id":74,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cnrfn9s","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Europe must do more to better integrate its Muslim communities, and not \"simply respond with a hammer\", US President Barack Obama said Friday in the wake of last week\u0027s terror attacks in France","label":"shady_as_fudge","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_2snnf7","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.421464197E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.421480545E9,"simScore":0.7663249842348341,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},{"index":75,"links":[74],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"bigpigfoot","label":"that\u0027s an interesting point of view, but does it apply to those \"terrorists\"?

Especially in metropolitan areas where most of Muslims live in. Also in USA people in general have more opportunities to build a living from scratch. In contrast here in Europe most countries are very nationalistic. And there is a stronger division between us and them. Here in Holland we even have a word for it autochtoon\u003d ethnic dutch, allochtoon\u003d immigrant dutch citizens. The immigrants are usually in a vicious cycle from day one. For example:\n\nA Syrian couple moves to Holland as refugees. They live here a few decades and get Dutch citizenship eventually. But all those decades they weren\u0027t allowed to work or to study, they just lived in a refugee camp basically doing nothing. So now they are citizens and they need to find a job and move out of the camp. Usually they cant speak Dutch well enough to compete on the job market and usually they don\u0027t have proper education. So they work as cleaners in school and hospitals and such. Get a minimum pay and live in minimum conditions. They get children who hear Syrian at home and have trouble learning Dutch from day one. At primary education they quickly fall behind their Dutch co-students. When at age 12 every child has to do a CITO test and the result determines to which secondary school you will go. Most immigrant children have trouble at school, because of their language issues caused by their situation at home and so have trouble keeping up the pace in other classes as well. So most of the immigrant kids get sent to VMBO which is a school for \"stupid\" kids. Officially it is not, but here in Holland everyone knows what VMBO is, who goes there, and no Dutch parent wants his kid to go there. So when kids end up in VMBO they start to develop an inferiority complex. Parents often talk about their kids and passively shame the ones who\u0027s kids arent performing as well. That if they are willing to talk to you at all.\nDrop out is quite high in VMBO, because many kids feel like it has no point, they are stupid and VMBO diploma is worthless, so there is no point trying. A very poisonous environment.\nBut lets say they manage to finish VMBO which lasts four years and get to go to college what options do they have there? Well right now the job market overall is very bad in Holland. Even with University degree its hard to find a job. So to find a good job with VMBO diploma is nearly impossible. Especially with the Polish work migrants willing to work very cheaply. For their levels of pay you can simply not live in Holland, but it is more than enough to send back to family in Poland. So the Syrian kid goes to MBO which is a college where options are very limited, you can become a hairdresser, or simple mechanics or administrator and such. With VMBO diploma you do not have access to University. If you want to become a doctor or a lawyer, nope. All of those jobs that you can study for at MBO are rather low end, and everyone knows it. So motivation is a huge struggle especially for the immigrants. Some Dutch kids have this mentality: \"I wanna be a garbageman, that is my dream!\" In Holland we try to promote this way of thinking but it is rare that young adults truly think like this, especially among immigrants. \n\nBut lets say you have successfully graduated from MBO and you are applying to over 100 companies every week and none of them even invites you to an interview. Why? because 1) your diploma is worthless, 2) there are ethnic Dutch who speak the language better than you with same or better diploma\u0027s 3) just because they don\u0027t want an immigrant in their office. And all this time through you hear that you are not trying hard enough, you are too lazy, you and people from Syria are all lazy and are a burden on Dutch society, you hear radical politicians say Islam is the religion of hatred and all Muslims must be deported and then you see that guy\u0027s party getting a huge amount of seats in the Parliament. So you start feeling like the whole society is against you and you start feeling unwanted even more and depressed, and the longer this continues the more you start to cluster within yourself or with people like you, other immigrants with no opportunities in life as well. So you all start poisoning each others mind further on about how there is no future for you. To fight this depression you start reading Koran a lot, go to the mosques trying to find god and get rid of this horrible feelings that thrives inside you. And the more you do this the more the Dutch society condemns you, they call you a radical, they call your people terrorists. You feel isolated, you want to matter, you want to contribute, but they don\u0027t want you here. So you pack your bags and go back to Syria. There, there is purpose, there is a goal, there you can belong to something, there you can make a change, you can matter. And so you land in Syria to fight for the freedom fighters, that turn out to be crazy fucked up psychopaths, but there is no way back now, back in Holland you are now a terrorist.","duration":"","id":74,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cnrfn9s","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Europe must do more to better integrate its Muslim communities, and not \"simply respond with a hammer\", US President Barack Obama said Friday in the wake of last week\u0027s terror attacks in France","label":"shady_as_fudge","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_2snnf7","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.421464197E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.421480545E9,"simScore":0.7663249842348341,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.421482603E9,"simScore":0.7451333242374837,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.421482603E9,"simScore":0.687067593551691,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.421487665E9,"simScore":0.6714311591115014,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.42148941E9,"simScore":0.7002007081869355,"sentiment":"  Positive"},"timestamp":1.421493939E9,"simScore":0.6910713639313917,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.421506103E9,"simScore":0.6008390019704568,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.421658209E9,"simScore":0.7702352332160788,"sentiment":"  Positive"},{"index":82,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"chrismilk","label":"Obama is so scared of giving muslims any of the blame.\n\nThere are always two sides to every conflict.","duration":"","id":82,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cnrc419","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Europe must do more to better integrate its Muslim communities, and not \"simply respond with a hammer\", US President Barack Obama said Friday in the wake of last week\u0027s terror attacks in France","label":"shady_as_fudge","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_2snnf7","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.421464197E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.421474086E9,"simScore":0.7115159590204223,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},{"index":83,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"bigpigfoot","label":"The problem isn\u0027t integration of Muslim communities.
