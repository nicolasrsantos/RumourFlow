The media is pushing the hijacking/intentional redirect theories because those make for good ratings when the truth is that it just doesn\u0027t make much sense. I\u0027m not saying that it isn\u0027t possible. It\u0027s just that for someone in the industry, what makes far more sense is that there was a progressive systems failure caused by *something* and that the crew became incapacitated at an early stage. The airplane would continue flying on the same heading after the initial turn was made, out of radar coverage the entire time (there is no radar coverage over the ocean) until it ran out of fuel.
