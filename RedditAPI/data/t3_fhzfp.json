How well did he do in school? \n\nThis is absolute fucking horseshit, as I stated in my last post.  Do you really think they would let someone ineligible to be a US Senator, let alone the President, be fucking sworn in to highest office of our country?  Get a fucking grip.  [Here\u0027s](http://factcheck.org/elections-2008/born_in_the_usa.html) just a [few links](http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/birthcertificate.asp) that might [clear](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2008/jun/27/obamas-birth-certificate-part-ii/) this [matter](http://fightthesmears.com/articles/5/birthcertificate) up for [you](http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2011/01/31/Hawaii-to-offer-Obama-birth-documents/UPI-89051296495330/).  Feel free to offer any evidence for your idiotic claim that no one knows where he was born.\n\nAs for this shit:\n\n\u0026gt;How well did he do in school? No telling, because he won\u0027t release his records.....probably flunked. Why the heck did he marry that beast? Maybe he doesn\u0027t care about looks. Why does he say \"Ha-wah-ee\" or \"Pok-ee-ston\"? Maybe he\u0027s reading a teleprompter and has no idea of what he\u0027s saying.\n\nWay to put forth a thoughtful coherent argument based on facts and reason instead of baseless attacks towards outward appearance and personal syntax.  Nice job there buddy.
