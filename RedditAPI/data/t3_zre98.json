I was on one of my on periods and was a member of the CFC (Cluster Fuck Coalition), which is easily the largest entity in the Eve world, and the one that Goonswarm heads up. Vile Rat was an integral part of Goonswarm, acting as a top level diplomat (among other things, he was very famous for doing a lot for the Goonswarm alliance, and serving on the Council of Stellar Management, the player group that has regular access to the developers, he was quite the legend in game). I mean no disrespect here, but being \"just\" an IT guy IRL, it seems somewhat poetic he perished with an ambassador, seeing as how that\u0027s what he was known as being in EVE (and a damn good one, too).\n\nWhat has got me really interested is The Mittani\u0027s comments in the article I linked to, which I\u0027ll quote here;\n\n\u0026gt;Obviously, given the combined attacks in Egypt and in Libya, this was a coordinated act designed for maximum media exposure; rile up a mob, point them at an embassy or consulate on 9/11 in particular, aim for the press. Many were injured in these pointless, reprehensible acts, and one of my closest friends was killed as a result.\n\nNow, The Mittani is very Internet famous, at least in EVE community, which has significant ties to Reddit, Something Awful, and 4chan (among others). In fact, I actually learned of Reddit from EVE, so... maybe my perspective is skewed.\n\nIn any case, The Mattani has at his disposal at least 2,000 Internet savvy computer nerds who are willing to follow his lead on pretty much anything. These aren\u0027t just neckbeards chilling in their mom\u0027s basement, either. They are highly skilled professionals (I know he\u0027s got at least one stock broker, who has been responsible for some amazingly awesome market manipulation schemes perpetrated by Goonswarm).\n\nI made the comment about taking over the Internet because when he was running for a spot on the CSM this past election period (which he won by a HUGE landslide), The Mittani talked about how if you have a significant portion of people willing to follow you, you can literally take over the Internet for a day or two, because he and Goonswarm did that for one reason or another. It had something to do with their crazy schemes.\n\nIn any case, knowing he has the power to do something like this, and being a former Washington lawyer, it looks like he suspects something fishy.\n\nAnyway, I\u0027ve got to run out to dinner really quick, but if people are interested, I\u0027ll add more when I get back.\n\nI really hope he plans on acting on this.
