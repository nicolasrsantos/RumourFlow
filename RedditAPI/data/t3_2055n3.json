And yet, after looking at 50% of the imagery I can only find a handful of boats and other objects; oil platforms, ships what appear to be fishing vessels, etc.  I couldn\u0027t find an image of a single airplane involved in the search.\n\nThen there\u0027s the radar data.  Did we really need days to find out that the plane had turned around?  I can\u0027t think of any other airline accident where the plane was out of touch for so long without anyone taking notice.  Isn\u0027t knowing where all the airplanes are worldwide a top priority for the government since 9/11?\n\nKudos to Tomnod for the idea of crowdsourcing a search, but I can\u0027t help but shake the feeling that the whole thing is just an elaborate deception; something to keep the public busy while the government is off doing something else.","duration":"","id":124,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cg0hqu3","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Malaysian Airlines MH370 Discussion Thread","label":"axolotl_peyotl","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_2055n3","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.39457937E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.394630179E9,"simScore":0.821489538585969,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.394632682E9,"simScore":0.5368515193579477,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":126,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"bonams","label":"just my 2cents as an aircraft maintenance engineer\n\n**probable theory for MH370: right wing structural failure?**\n\n[aircraft course changed from 25° track to 40° track](http://i.imgur.com/3fj3qZ8.png) during its last moments on radar and its speed reduced from 474knots to 471knots.

Been following this pretty closely and the following is the only theory I have come up with that I can\u0027t pick holes in so I had to type it out. \n\nPlane disappeared at a very specific point on the flight path at a waypoint which also happens to be the switch over point between Malaysia and Vietnam air traffic control. Pilot was heard to say \u0027all right, good night\u0027 to Malaysia after being informed of the switch over. Vietnam were never contacted. This timing would suggest knowledge/prior planning.\n\nAt this point I think the pilot would have initiated his plan. Being an over night flight the cabin crew would have been less active anyway but the pilot may have spoken to cabin crew in such a way to give him more time alone in the cockpit. He then will have quickly incapacitated the other pilot in the cockpit. He would have steered the plane west as seen on Malaysian radar before switching off all tracking and comms and changing altitude to effectively become \u0027invisible\u0027. Now invisible, he would change heading again to north east over the South China Sea. At this point crew and passengers would be none the wiser, the wayward pilot could have even made an announcement over the tannoy to reassure people about any recent maneuvres. This would explain why there was no distress calls made by either the pilot, crew or passengers. It would also explain why the plane was thought to have changed its heading to the west.\n\nWe now know that the plane never re-appeared on any radar so therefore it never made it to any land mass. So it must have gone into the sea. The Mallaca Strait radar sighting and search has drawn a blank.\n\nTherefore I believe that the plane headed north east to the South China Sea where the pilot knew that radar could be avoided and phone signal would be non existent. It was then deliberately crashed into the water. This could be an attempt to make it as hard as possible to track down the wreckage and therefore the true cause of the crash. \n\nThe above corresponds to the oil rig sighting and the recent Chinese \u0027wreckage\u0027 pictures. Obviously I can\u0027t comment on either pilot on board but you\u0027d need a huge amount of experience and knowledge to pull off this plan so effectively.

By all means i do not want to come across as racist, judgemental or inconsiderate to towards anyone or anything involved in this incident. These are simply my thoughts and my way of attempting to help solve this unfortunate mystery.\n\nWhenever we hear about a significant airline terrorism incident it seems to be caused by a fresh mysterious act that always finds a flaw in the security systems. Lets face it, horribly beings are always coming up with new innovative ways to slide through the cracks of airline security. In case you haven\u0027t noticed, my thoughts are directed at terrorism and heres what my brain seemed to come up with piecing the mystery together.\n\nIs it possible flight 370 was hijacked.. yes of course. If this was the case, why hasn\u0027t any body made a claim about such an act?, terrorists like to do that sort of thing you know, make a stand point and take credit for their horrific intentions. For a minute lets assume flight 370 was hijacked and take into the consideration that terrorists are always coming up with innovative plans.\n\nIs it a possibility that flight 370 was landed safely, after being hijacked, and having its location systems deactivated (possibility), at a remote location that could be further undetected. Think about it for a minute, these terrorists could obtain a devastating suicidal homing missile the size of a building and a further 239 alive hostages. This aircraft could be used in future horrific plans and could just be the beginning of something terrible.\n\nI can briefly demonstrate a couple of evidences that might support this theory.\n\n*Some family\u0027s of flight 370 were able to call their flight victims cell phone briefly before being disconnected. How is this possible?http://mashable.com/2014/03/11/why-malaysia-airlines-passengers-phones-ring/\n\n*No debris have been found, possible satellite images could be very unlikely inaccurate.

I believe the US framed Russia (for what I have yet to discover... perhaps to get Russia to disarm the rebels? ) only to get rid of veteran AIDS/HIV researchers. America sees any country evolving as a threat. In what ways to remain the most powerful country.. Resources?! Money, education, technology, medicine, food, sanitation etc..I believe we were primarily close to finding the cure for AIDS from years of research from many of the passengers on that flight. What country is most effected by AIDS?! (think about it... it\u0027s politics). By keeping the poor,\" poor\" and the weak \"weaker.\" The US has a better chance of staying on top. Also, the US initially seized all activity for the search of the black boxes until they had the opportunity to review the site first to avoid fraudulent confiscation of evidence. (Ya Right!) Why was the plane flying over a war zone in the first place? Wasn\u0027t there a more direct route to their destination? Finally, can someone please explain how all of this extreme evidence of videos and audio has emerged out the blue only to point the finger at Russia. If the alleged video activity showed missiles being moved by Russia, and it fact we were aware of this strange activity initially, why didn\u0027t anyone say anything? I would like to think if Russia was honestly responsible for shooting down flight 17 that they wouldn\u0027t be dumb enough to use their own missiles which of course is recorded.
