By the time we were actually going into Iraq, there had been a big ordeal about the weapons inspectors, and Bush had been caught in several lies. No one of any intelligence thought Iraq had anything to do with 9/11 by then. Of course that leaves a big part of the population, the Fox News audience type, who thought killing everyone of Middle Eastern descent was America\u0027s holy right of revenge.\n\nBy the time the invasion began, Bush hadn\u0027t even been trying to claim an Iraq-9/11 link anymore. That idea had been fully debunked, and even the MSM had dropped it. The Downing Street Memo hadn\u0027t been leaked yet, but it was clear to people who payed attention to not just US media and politics, but to worldwide sources, that the yellowcake \"intelligence\" was really sketchy, and far too convenient for Bush.  \n\nAs far as the war, US opinion was pretty divided. It was clear that the entire rest of the world wanted a diplomatic solution, to at least give Iraq the benefit of the doubt before taking any military action. But in the US, most liberals wanted to avoid war and most conservatives believed the president\u0027s bullshit, that Saddam was just a evil dictator who needed to be removed no matter what (and without any explanation).","duration":"","id":20,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_cuoky7u","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":19,"links":[9],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"ronintetsuro","label":"\u0026gt; even most Americans believed that.\n\nAre you old enough to remember this?
