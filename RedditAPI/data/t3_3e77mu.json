His service and everything else he did while he was captured, does make him a hero. So score one for truth, minus one for context and asshattery. \n\nWhat Trump said about Mexicans was about illegals (oh sorry.. \"undocumented\") not simply \"Mexicans\", those that are not \"forced\" to stay in Mexico and given a blind eye to cross the border and while YES he knew how it was going to come across, he really did not mean all Mexicans were rapists and murders.  So score one half for truth, minus ten for context and asshattery.\n\nWhat he said about the other republicans in the field was almost spot on.. Rick Perry? Really? He DID put on the glasses to make himself seem smarter.  Lindsey Graham. IS an Idiot. So score 10 for truth, minus 1 for context and asshattery.\n\nHe\u0027s about even.\n\nNow, again, I am not a Trump supporter but he is not actually \"crazy\" he just doesn\u0027t know how to win an election, he knows how to stir up shit.  That got him in the polls, over the course of the next year he will be in the bottom and probably end up being the spoiler for the republican party in some way, especially if he jumps in as an independent after not getting the nomination.. or you know, promo his next TV show.\n\nThe reason I will not vote for Trump is not what he says or what his personal views might be it is simply because I can never vote for a guy who always thinks he is the smartest guy in the room because rarely is that ever the case. He will cause all of us some serious trouble and turn the presidency into comic relief every night.

There is ample opportunity in that stretch of time to reform beliefs about all sorts of different issues.\n\nWhere flip-flopping becomes a problem for me is when politicians (Romney was guilty of this) come out both for and against certain issues in a very short time-span.
