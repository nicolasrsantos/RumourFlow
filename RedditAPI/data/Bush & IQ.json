Iraqi officials prevent the inspectors from leaving the site for four days.\n\n* March 19, 1992 - Iraq declares that it once possessed 89 missiles and chemical weapons, but destroyed them in the summer of 1991. This unilateral destruction of weapons is a violation of SCR 687.\n\n* July 1992 - UNSCOM destroys some Iraqi chemical weapons and production facilities.\n\n* June 1994 - UNSCOM destroys material and equipment relating to chemical weapons production.\n\n* July 1, 1995 - Iraq admits the existence of its biological weapons program.\n\n* May 1996 - Al-Hakam, a facility used for the production of biological weapons agents, is destroyed.\n\n* September 25, 1997 - During an inspection of a food laboratory, inspectors seize suspicious documents concerning bacteria and chemicals. The documents originate from the Iraqi Special Security Office.

Security Council on inspections. He presents evidence that the U.S. says proves Iraq has misled inspectors and hid proscribed weapons and equipment.   **This is generally used as the evidence that Bush lied**\n\n* February 14, 2003 - Blix and ElBaradei brief the U.N. Security Council. Blix reports that the inspectors have not yet found any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Blix also reports that Iraq is in violation of U.N. resolutions concerning its al Samoud 2 missile program.\n\n* February 27, 2003 - Iraq agrees to destroy the country's al Samoud II missile stock. However, the letter doesn't specify a date that the missile destruction will begin.\n\n* March 10, 2003 - It is revealed that Iraq possesses drone aircraft that could have been used to launch a chemical or biological attack against other countries. The plane has a wingspan of 24ft 5in, which suggests that it could fly further than 150km/93 miles, which is the limit imposed by U.N. resolutions.\n\n* March 18, 2003 - Inspectors withdraw from Iraq.\n* March 20, 2003 - (local time) U.S. and coalition forces begin military action against Iraq.\n\nNow after all that you tell me where you knew without a doubt that Iraq didn't have wmd's or were otherwise in violation of the cease fire agreement that ended the Gulf War.\n\nThere really was no other need of justification to resume hostilities other than that.","duration":"","id":118,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_cehhmez","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":117,"links":[107],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"Republinuts","label":"I'm not sure why you're taking this position.

The Fed for the past few decades has kept interest rates artificially low by purchasing securities from private banks on the open market. This has the effect of creating short-term growth (and political points for the supposedly apolitical Federal Reserve) at the cost of long-term malinvestment and economic instability. \n\nRegression analysis using 10-year housing returns as the dependent variable and interest rates as the independent variable show a *extremly* strong negative casual relationship between the two.

They had a methodology!\", let me just point out that what I am saying here is that the methodology just plain *sucks*. \r\n\r\nYou see, in order to be useful, a psychometric scale must have two traits: *validity* and *reliability*. \r\n\r\nA *valid* test is one that measures what it is supposed to measure, what it is used in the attempt to rate. An IQ test is valid to the extent that it measures intelligence. (And saying that it's \"only supposed to measure IQ\" is a feeble tautological cop-out.)\r\n\r\nA *reliable* test generates results that are consistent over time, and change only insofar as the underlying construct alters. An IQ test is reliable to the extent that the same person, taking it on two different days, will get the same score. \r\n\r\nNow, let us examine how these results were actually obtained:\r\n\r\n\"Assessment began by extracting personality\r\ndescriptions from several biographical sources for 39 presidents from\r\nWashington through Reagan. All identifying information was then removed to\r\nproduce anonymous biographical profiles. Several independent judges used these\r\nprofiles in conjunction with the Gough Adjective Check List (Gough &amp; Heilbrun,\r\n1965) to rate the presidents on 300 descriptors, obtaining reliable assessments for\r\n110 adjectives (cf. Deluga, 1997, 1998; Historical Figures Assessment Collaborative,\r\n1977). These latter measures were then subjected to a factor analysis that\r\nobtained 14 distinct dimensions. One of these factors included such items as\r\n“intelligent,�? “wise,�? “inventive,�? “interests wide,�? “artistic,�? “curious,�? “sophisticated,�?\r\n“complicated,�? and “insightful�? (but not “dull�? or “commonplace�?). Moreover,\r\na factor score defined by the linear composite of these items yielded\r\na measure having an internal-consistency reliability (coefficient alpha) of .90\r\n(Simonton, 1986c). The resulting factor was then interpreted as assessing the\r\nchief executives on Intellectual Brilliance.\"\r\n\r\nThe flaws in this methodology are so obvious as to make describing them an exercise in cruelty to the PI. Nevertheless, in the interests of thoroughness, I will give some basic guidelines to think about, and leave working out the details to the reader.\r\n\r\nConsider:  \r\n\r\nThe assessment method used filters through two layers of observer description. The \"blind\" nature of the second layer might help to remove bias, but what effect does it have to improve reliability?\r\n\r\nIn terms of reliability, can these tests be repeated? \r\n\r\nIn terms of validity, can these tests make testable (falsifiable) predictions?\r\n\r\nIn terms of both reliability and validity, what is the control group? \r\n\r\n","duration":"","id":104,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c1uvif","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4,"level":5,"title":"Presidential IQ - Bush is *NOT* the dumbest.","label":"flemlord","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_1uujg","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1180618973,"simScore":0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1180632557,"simScore":0.7691509975550541,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":105,"links":[0],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"dln","label":"A bully personality always seems stupider to others than they might actually be.

When it comes down to it, I want whats best for the North American scene, and for League of Legends as a whole. Sometimes that might mean \"bandwagoning\" onto the back of the team that's doing the best. Is that so wrong?\n\nDespite that, I agree with OP. I think that encouragement of the pro players is one of the best ways that we can improve the scene. When the pros don't have to worry about getting crap for every little mistake they make, they will honestly probably perform better. I think that it's important to support the players that you love, and also to support those that are doing the best, because they provide the best chance for us to do well in the international scene.","duration":"","id":307,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cbhvgmx","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4,"level":5,"title":"Being a Curse fan","label":"bluemond","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_1js6iq","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1375782470,"simScore":0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1375794649,"simScore":0.706611656390427,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":308,"links":[0],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"nozzlen","label":"Glad to read this. :) Watching Cop/Saint Get Shit talked to because they get caught out once. or God forbid they get outsmited by another professional League of Legends player.

So the only connection is that they were investigated by the same Congressional committee.\n\nHere is the only thing the program says about Bush: \n\n&gt; Later in the McCormack-Dickstein report, a shipping company called Hamburg-America Line was accused of providing free passage to Germany to American journalists willing to write favorable copy on Hitler's rise to power. The company is also alleged to have brought Nazi spies and pro-fascist sympathizers into America. John Buchanan has studied this latest section of the report and has discovered that one of the company's managers came from a very famous family. \"The thing that surprised me most was to discover in the documents of this company that Hamburg-America Lines had, in fact, been managed on the U. S. side at the executive level by Prescott Bush as part of a web of Nazi business interests that were all seized in late 1942 under the Trading with the Enemy Act by the U. S. Congress and Prescott Bush is the grandfather of the sitting President of the United States.\" [John Buchanan]\n\n&gt; Of course, at the time it was perfectly legal to have dealings with Hitler's Germany.

When I first saw his [Olaf 2v1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjOBv8SlVb4) in the Season 3 Qualifier I was blown away. This is what a pro looks like. They know when they have the upper hand and they exploit it to the fullest. After that game I watched and learned much from the Voyman those coming months watching his stream nearly every day, constantly learning how to approach the game with different champions and learning their limits. \n\nThen the Spring Split started and I watched as my favorite player's team steam roll the competition. Curse had my attention and kept it throughout the split win or lose I rooted for them. I became more attached to the other members as well. Often, watching Saint, and Jacky whenever they were streaming (and Voyboy wasn't). I watched their interviews and their charity causes and came to really enjoy their personalities.\n\nThen Summer Split started. They had a new roster(Привет друг!) and were facing new threats, yet I still believed in them. Then they lost, and lost, lost again, went back and then lost. But guess what?  I was still a fan. I still am a fan. Not because my team is 21 and 2. I am still a fan because Curse gives back so much to the community, and they are a good group of guys that have helped me understand the game more than I did before. \n\nIt was hard watching them lose in the beginning this is true. But that never made me want to jump on the C9 bandwagon(though I do respect C9 and think they are all incredibly talented). I stayed with Curse and wanted them to win because I cared about the future of their players. I wanted success for them so that they could continue in the scene.\n\nI guess my main message today is believe in your team and help them know that they have true fans. Don't come to reddit raging after Saint missed a smite, screaming for him to be benched. Instead I urge you to go to their stream post a \"Hey man, better luck next time!\" (Side note: Cop, if you read this pleeeeease stream more. You are the reason I started playing MF.

Show your team you support them through thick and thin, raise your dongers, do what you got to do. But don't ever drop them when they are playing poorly. That's when they need you guys the most.\n\nTL;DR: Put your team on your shoulders when they win, and be ready to catch them when they lose. Don't drop your team, it means a lot to these guys.\n\nEdit: Wow, thanks guys! Way to show your support. I just want to be clear, I'm not condemning C9 or any other team people are a fan of.

No. No !&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","domain":"self.AskWomen","gilded":0,"commentCount":74,"score":14,"upVotes":14,"downVotes":0,"created":1440796604,"createdUTC":1440767804,"visited":false,"self":false,"saved":false,"edited":false,"stickied":false,"nsfw":false,"hidden":false,"clicked":false,"users":["lipsnailssex","girlwithruinedteeth","LipsNailsSex","HigHog","thumper5","LipsNailsSex","dissonant_one","lipsnailssex","ananasburn","LipsNailsSex","ananasburn","anniewriter","LipsNailsSex","anniewriter","lipsnailssex","anniewriter","lipsnailssex","anniewriter","lipsnailssex","xsolcii","LipsNailsSex","brea92821","lipsnailssex","brea92821","lipsnailssex","brea92821","nervette","LipsNailsSex","PurpleFuzzy","nervette","miniaturegiraffe","LipsNailsSex","dmkrispin","LipsNailsSex","panda_melody","kleokat","panda_melody","LipsNailsSex","panda_melody","lipsnailssex","panda_melody","pinkmermaid","LipsNailsSex","im_a_god_damn_otter","LipsNailsSex","ms_moonlight","LipsNailsSex","irish-ygritte","LipsNailsSex","jammmbo","LipsNailsSex","optimisma","LipsNailsSex","ronniejean1","_babayaga_","LipsNailsSex","_babayaga_","lipsnailssex","_babayaga_","lipsnailssex","send_me_pubes","LipsNailsSex"],"kind":"t3","identifier":"3iq1e5","fullName":"t3_3iq1e5"},{"user":{"username":"hellovn100","modhash":"og4gwagtobb9bb2475b79528e57ecaa5c6d00418f3d1071bdf","cookie":"43916988,2015-11-22T14:14:16,ee710e289381efe71e0bfcf03217cccc19624590","password":"111111"},"wikis":[],"url":"http://imgur.com/a/VoLVi","commentContent":"","permalink":"/r/AsiansGoneWild/comments/3iq8q1/bush_ass_pussywhich_your_favour/?ref=search_posts","author":"sexybiggirl","title":"bush ,ass, pussy......which your favour?","subreddit":"AsiansGoneWild","subredditId":"t5_2wm0g","thumbnail":"nsfw","selftext":"","domain":"imgur.com","gilded":0,"commentCount":28,"score":234,"upVotes":234,"downVotes":0,"created":1440800057,"createdUTC":1440771257,"visited":false,"self":false,"saved":false,"edited":false,"stickied":false,"nsfw":true,"hidden":false,"clicked":false,"users":["sexybiggirl","killfast11","sissyboi333","charliemorning","boredboyinnc","hueyfe2011","moomoohoo","dfj2xxx","blkclrkknt","heymamix","sexybiggirl","dingostolemybaebae","jdrchef","sexybiggirl","jdrchef","burnerfone","sexybiggirl","burnerfone","geminmyeye","mackhigh","akwehhkanoo","westcoastfiend","Westcoastfiend","takesmorethanlondon","longryder","sexybiggirl","longryder"],"kind":"t3","identifier":"3iq8q1","fullName":"t3_3iq8q1"}],"sankeyNodes":[],"sentiments":["-0.6956522","-0.7647059","-0.53846157","-0.64341086","-0.73913044","-0.8918919","-0.6666667","-0.73284316","-0.74588233","-0.682243","-0.5441176","-0.73770493","-0.6315789","-0.7085427","-0.6862745","-0.5121951","-0.7419355","-0.5483871","-0.5232","-0.47058824"],"keyword":"Bush & IQ"}
