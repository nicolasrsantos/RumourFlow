And everybody who knew the US was going to war under false pretences.\n\nThere are, and were, two problems with buying into the \"see they were lying\" argument.\n\nFirstly, the claim that Iraq had WMD, whether being lied about or not, required evidence that was never produced. Powell\u0027s powerpoint slide of what could have been icecream trucks does not count. The argument should have been \"show me the evidence\". [A few voices were rightly making that argument](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003d_k_QbpFl7RM) but it didn\u0027t get the traction it deserved.\n\nSecondly even if Iraq had WMD that still doesn\u0027t justify an invasion by the US. There is no treaty that specifies the criteria of who is allowed to have WMD and who does not. There is article 6 of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) that requires all countrys to get rid of their nukes. The US, at the time, had a strategic plan to *develop* it\u0027s own nuclear arsenal. \n\nThe idea that the only country to have ever used weapons of mass destruction in a massively destructive way (3,000 kurds chemically killed by Saddam was appalling but falls well short of the mass destruction of the 100,000 + killed by the US nukes) would be morally justified in invading a country for possessing WMD is - a world gone made.

It was a bipartisan effort to destabilize the Middle East and recruit lots more terrorists.\n\nAs soon as George Bush was installed in the White House in January 2001, Paul Wolfowitz and his Office of Special Plans set to work on cooking up the faked and falsified \"intel\" that would allow Cheney to invade Iraq after the \"new Pearl Harbor\" had occurred.\n\nSee PNAC. Jeb Bush is one of the 25 original signatories to PNAC. Others included Cheney, Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century\n\nDonald Kagan, Father-in-law to Victoria Nuland was also an original signatory.\n\nVictoria Nuland\u0027s husband Robert Kagan was a co-founder of PNAC, together with Bill Kristol.\n\nVictoria Nuland is currently Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs and was responsible for organizing the Coup in Ukraine and installing Yatsenuk (a self confessed Fascist supporter) as PM in Kiev.\n\nThe lies and the Neocon wars have not stopped. They are still going on in Syria and Ukraine using proxies. The proxies are ISIS and Al-Qaeda in Syria (and previously Libya), and Nazis in Ukraine.\n\nThe reasons the US went to war against Saddam were:-\n\nSaddam refused to do a \"oil for arms\" deal along the same lines as the Saudis and was becoming independent (this started before the first Gulf War in 1991).\n\nIn 2000 Saddam announced he was going to sell oil in Euros and not dollars and encouraged OPEC to do the same. This was a threat to the Petrodollar system and $ hegemony.\n\nThe Yinon plan, from the 1980\u0027s, for Greater Israel which would extend from the Nile to the Euphrates, covering parts of what is now Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. In order to achieve this plan all of the surrounding Arab States to Israel have to be turned into chaos and balkanized one by one, so they are weak enough for Israel to fully control.\n\nThe invasion of Iraq was specifically designed to:-\n\nDestabilize Iraq and start a civil war\n\nRecruit lots more Islamic Extremist terrorists, to enable future wars or regime changes in neighboring countries to Israel. Libya, Syria, Lebanon and Iran are specifically mentioned as targets in PNAC, as well as mentions for Afghanistan, Sudan and Somalia.\n\nTo very dramatically increase arms spending by the US government and others, thus greatly increasing the profits of arms companies.\n\nTo increase the oil price, by limiting Iraq\u0027s output of oil.\n\nTo make $bn\u0027s for bankers by increasing US government debt.\n\nTo personally enrich members of the Bush regime and their cronies. Cheney made over $80m just for himself, then there is the Carlyle Group and it\u0027s \"investors\" HW Bush, the Saudis and the Bin Laden family etc.\n\nTo use the terrorism threat created by destabilizing the Middle East to shred what was left of the Constitution after the Patriot Act had been enacted.\n\nOf course all the Neocons are dumb as shit and what the implementation of their plans has done is to make China and Russia relatively stronger, hastened the end of US hegemony and the dramatic weakening of Israel\u0027s main benefactor without whose large scale support it probably will not survive.\n","duration":"","id":68,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_crh98we","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":65,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"donnies1","label":"These Democrats were the source of the information.\n\n\"One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them.
