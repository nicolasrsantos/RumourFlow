We became infested with illness, and fought off most of them all by ourselves.\n\nWe now live in a world were we indulge in synthetic substances that destroy viruses, rather than allow our bodies to adapt, learn, and destroy (Obviously there are exceptions depending on severity).  We go to a grocery store for food, or visit a fast-food chain, instead of tracking, hunting, cooking, and eating animals.  \n\nOur family have very close friends that were fed medication all their life whenever they were sick.

There are new genetic constructs against AML (acute myeloid leukemia) targets, and there will certainly be constructs for other malignancies coming soon.  Novartis has invested heavily in this, and rumor is they are building a plant and trying to figure out how to scale this up and commercialize it.  With the one caveat being that it\u0027s not clear how you turn OFF these modified T-cells when you are done with them, people are pretty excited.  The turning off thing is key because of the modified T-cells are directed against a target on cancer cells that is also shared by normal cells - such as CD19, which is on normal B-lymphocytes - then the modified T-cells will just as happily kill the normal cells. So you will need to figure out how to turn them off.  Oh, and the therapy can be very toxic due to massive release of inflammatory mediators (cytokines).

Individualizing cancer treatments can be a very successful method, unfortunately, this costs a lot of money, something that insurance companies might not feel is worth it.","duration":"","id":196,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cebla9f","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":124,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"hessalam","label":"So can anyone explain to me why this isn\u0027t as groundbreaking as the title is attempting to make it seem?","duration":"","id":124,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cebdfgs","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"TIL Researchers have taken the HIV virus, modified it and then used it to reprogram a cancer patients white blood cells to attack and completely kill off the cancer","label":"mybadusername","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_1ttn6l","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.388199812E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.388206011E9,"simScore":0.7931745993564763,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.388227189E9,"simScore":0.7571057770693589,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":197,"links":[124],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"cetam","label":"think of it like this.  you body is a huge corporation with 10,000 employees.  everyone has a job, and as long as they do their job the company is profitable and continues to grow.  now all of a sudden a few people decides to stop doing their job, instead they\u0027re going to steal from the company, and to help them steal from the company they start hiring new people and corrupting existing employees.  this is essentially cancer, and you need to eliminate it before it spreads to other departments of the company and bankrupt the entire organization.  so how do you get rid of it?  if the corruption is largely in a nonessential department, then you can fire everyone in the department and never hire them back.   this is essentially what surgery does.  if the corruption is in multiple departments or in an essential department then you have to be more careful.  for example if you knew the corruption is coming from a nepotistic manager then you\u0027d fire everyone related to him or with the same last name.  this is essentially chemotherapy.  the method listed in this article is similar.  say you notice all the members of the nepotistic manager\u0027s posse likes to wear a green scarf.   what the therapy is doing is akin to telling the security staff to shoot all the employees wearing green.  this in the short term may be effective but the order cannot be rescinded, so when st. patrick\u0027s day rolls around it\u0027s a blood bath at the company.  this is called an autoimmune disease.  and the only way to deal with it is to kill off the security staff, which in turn opens the door for corrupted employees to return.","duration":"","id":197,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_ceblmnq","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":124,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"hessalam","label":"So can anyone explain to me why this isn\u0027t as groundbreaking as the title is attempting to make it seem?","duration":"","id":124,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cebdfgs","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"TIL Researchers have taken the HIV virus, modified it and then used it to reprogram a cancer patients white blood cells to attack and completely kill off the cancer","label":"mybadusername","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_1ttn6l","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.388199812E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.388206011E9,"simScore":0.7931745993564763,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.388228166E9,"simScore":0.8207396640286342,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":198,"links":[124],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"brainflakes","label":"A good rule of thumb when dealing with cancer cure articles is to change \"X cures cancer\" to \"X cures *a type of* cancer\".

Reasoning HIV is a virus that has CD-8 receptors I believe (or cd-4 cannot remember really tired), this means it attacks the cell from the inside. It goes into the cell changes the dna of the cell and replicates itself meaning, in this case, changing the coding of HIV will make it so new cells are made with this \"New\" DNA. Simple concept.\n\nAnother reason why this isn\u0027t so important is the law of random chance. For a study two errors can occur Type I or Type II. Type I is a false positive and Type II is a false negative. Type I means, okay the alpha is .95, that there is a .05% of the negative data shows positive, by data a mean a whole test individually. Then there a type II\u0027s which  still skew the data, but not going to explain them. What happens is that many tests every year that  show positive results that are actually negative. An example of this would be adding 100g of chocolate per meal, per day, without exercise will reduce weight. The test has around 100 random participants all, lets say, male in mid-30s slightly over-weight. Do the test about 1000 times and there is a distinct possibility one of the tests will give a positive result even though we know it cannot happen. So this goes onto the second point quite nicely for an experiment to be proven it needs to be accurate and repeatable. The experiment is quite accurate, using good methods, now someone else, somewhere else in the world needs to go and do the test again to see it is repeatable to make sure a type I error didn\u0027t occur, the funny thing is there is still a possibility of a type II error occurring leading to further hilarity in the world we call statistics and epidemiology  ","duration":"","id":206,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cebscoq","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":124,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"hessalam","label":"So can anyone explain to me why this isn\u0027t as groundbreaking as the title is attempting to make it seem?","duration":"","id":124,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cebdfgs","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"TIL Researchers have taken the HIV virus, modified it and then used it to reprogram a cancer patients white blood cells to attack and completely kill off the cancer","label":"mybadusername","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_1ttn6l","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.388199812E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.388206011E9,"simScore":0.7931745993564763,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.388251779E9,"simScore":0.7264124451324767,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":207,"links":[124],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"bedroomwindow_cougar","label":"Twas just another day AIDS and cancer were cured.","duration":"","id":207,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cebll96","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":124,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"hessalam","label":"So can anyone explain to me why this isn\u0027t as groundbreaking as the title is attempting to make it seem?","duration":"","id":124,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cebdfgs","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"TIL Researchers have taken the HIV virus, modified it and then used it to reprogram a cancer patients white blood cells to attack and completely kill off the cancer","label":"mybadusername","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_1ttn6l","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.388199812E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.388206011E9,"simScore":0.7931745993564763,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.388228058E9,"simScore":0.7359142793076379,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":208,"links":[124],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"stainwaggin","label":"I can.

The ones used in treatment of cancer are called Oncolytic (cancer cell killing) viruses. The overall premise is pretty simple if you understand the concepts behind a virus and a tumor cell. What does a virus do inside our body? It infects and kills cells, and spreads within an organ tissue. What is a tumor? A malignant type tumor (cancerous) is a tissue packed with growing tumor cells. The oncolytic virus, in this case the retrovirus can infect the tumor cells, this will cause the oncolytic virus to replicate inside the cells and eventually lyse them (kill them), so eventually the virus will replicate inside the tumor cells, lyse them and spread to neighboring tumor cells. Its not as simple as that though, these viruses have to be modified. You have to look at 4 things, 1) modification for selective entry into tumor cells, 2) modification for selective replication in tumor cells, 3) using tumor-specific promoters to drive essential viral gene expression, and 4) viruses with natal ability to replicate in malignant cells. Whenever a cell is infected or becomes cancerous, it usually produces a type of beacon on the surface of said cell to let the immune system know its infected. There is much more science behind this but hope this helps, we\u0027ve been using this method for awhile now.
