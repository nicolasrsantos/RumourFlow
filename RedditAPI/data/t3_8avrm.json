It was never about driving out the Palistineans and stealing their land.

Look at a detailed history and timeline, especially in those first few decades, and you\u0027ll see that in almost all cases it was the Arabs who instigated through terrorist attacks and such and the Israelites who subsequently retaliated. Right now they are both committing crimes on the other and neither side is faultless; but considering their plight in 1947, would the Jews have any reason or inclination to instigate hostilities to the Palistineans or the many Arab nations surrounding them?\n\nIn the least, a continent sized group of Arab nations being uncharitable and violently hostile towards the Jews wanting a tiny, largely undeveloped, piece of land refects badly upon their religion.
