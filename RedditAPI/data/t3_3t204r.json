Religious people are all manipulated and confused in some way. It\u0027s like when you first learned how to play the board game Clue with your older sister when you were growing up. The instructions were missing, so she just made up the rules without you knowing, and never told you she made it all up. Then you grow up and eventually go to college. You\u0027re hanging out with some cool new people, and the girl you really like. Then, someone busts out Clue. No one really remembers exactly how to play though. This time the instructions to play the game are there, but no one has any real interest in reading them. You want to impress everyone, so you get super excited and immediately tell everyone how to play - that whoever is the oldest gets to see all the cards you\u0027re holding whenever they want. You\u0027re dead serious. Everyone is shocked because even though they sort of forgot how to play the game, they absolutely know that what you said is not a rule, and never was... because it\u0027s really really fucking stupid. It takes you a minute to realize that yes, wow, they\u0027re right, what you said makes absolutely no sense. You are embarrassed and mad because someone you love lied to you for their own personal gain, and coldly took advantage of your innocence. You quickly realize that all your life you have blindly accepted a lie. You can\u0027t believe it and you won\u0027t accept it. Now you feel helpless and alone because everyone else in the room is laughing at you, even that pretty girl you like. You get incredibly mad and defensive. In a panic and last ditch effort to look smart, you instinctively stand by the rules you just told everyone. Even though you and everyone else knows it is some serious bullshit. You get up, flip the board off the table, and ruin the game for everyone else so that they can\u0027t play by the actual rules. You leave, and now hate those people because you think that they hate you... but what you don\u0027t know is that they don\u0027t hate you at all. They are just a bit shocked by how you acted and wonder why you got so mad. They simply pick the game back up after you left, and keep on playing without you. So now you feel the need to surround yourself with others who are like how you once were, and haven\u0027t played clue before. You tell them the rules your sister told you, because you never did read the actual instructions that came with the game, and you won\u0027t because you are too ashamed at yourself to acknowledge that you have been wrong your entire life. Eventually, someone outside your group will want to play Clue with you again, but you will just get mad because you still won\u0027t know how to play the game how it was meant to be played. \n\nTL:DR - Most religious people actually know that all their beliefs are bullshit, but are too embarrassed and ashamed to ever admit it to themselves, or anyone else. \n\n...Also, I had to re-learn the instructions to a lot of boardgames due to a wonderful older sister with an impressive winning streak.","duration":"","id":340,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cx31fwj","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":339,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"trailrider","label":"I had some thoughts that came to me earlier today based on christians in the US response to the refugees.\n\nThe entire supposed doctrine of Jesus is one of selfless sacrifice.
