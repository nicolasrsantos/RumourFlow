Back in the days of yore, I worked for the voter registration office during an election. One of the big things we had to do was handle absentee balloting and early absentee voting. Hell, they hired a few \"seasonal\" employees like me just to help with the manpower required to do it.\n\nThis is in South Carolina, so these rules are very specific to the state. But basically there are only 13 ways to get an absentee ballot or vote early in South Carolina. You can be:\n\n1) A student away at college,\n\n2) a member of the Armed Forces, Merchant Marines, Red Cross, USO, government employees (or a spouse or dependent residing with such a person) \n\n3) you live overseas\n\n4) your job prevents you from voting in person \n\n5) you are physically disabled \n\n6) you are away on vacation \n\n7) you are 65 or older\n\n8) you have been admitted to the hospital as an emergency patient on day of election or at least four days prior to the election\n\n9) there has been a death or funeral in your family within 3 days before the election\n\n10) you are confined to a jail or pre-trial facility pending disposition of arrest or trial\n\n11) you are attending sick or physically disabled persons\n\n12) you are on jury duty in state or federal court on election day \n\n13) you are a certified poll watcher, poll manager, or county elecion official and you will be working on election day\n\nThat\u0027s it. Gonna be out of state for any other reason? Forget it. Got a surgery scheduled for election day? Yeah, not happening. Additionally, some of those rules have some caveats. Like #4. When they say *your job prevents you*, they mean it. Like actually prevents you from voting. \"My workplace is a 2 hour commute from here, but my boss only gives me an hour to go vote,\" isn\u0027t an excuse. They mean people like nurses, nuclear technicians, etc who\u0027s work *actually requires them* to be there for a whole shift that would preclude them from voting. If you have any remote possibility of being able to get in your car and get to the polling place, you don\u0027t qualify. #8 also has an obvious logistical problem. You have to have the absentee ballot submitted four days before the election. If you get injured the weekend before the election, and confined to a hospital bed, even if you\u0027d normally qualify there isn\u0027t actually time to get your absentee ballot. While these 13 rules do cover a lot of cases where people aren\u0027t going to be there on election day, there are *always* weird edge cases that don\u0027t qualify, because there is no \"you can get an absentee ballot if you are not going to be able to get to your precinct that day\" choice. They\u0027re all qualified reasons that are laid out specifically.\n\nBut setting that aside, you also have to request an absentee ballot at least 4 days in advance of election day. Are you arrested the weekend before election day? Sorry, you don\u0027t get to vote unless you\u0027re able to post bail before election day, even if you haven\u0027t been convicted of anything. Maybe one of your parents overseas died the weekend before election day. Sorry, even if you\u0027d normally qualify, you\u0027re too late to get an absentee ballot now. Etc, etc. there\u0027s always edge cases where people get disenfranchised by not being present on the day of the election, or being called away for some other reason than those listed.\n\nBut there\u0027s also some other silly ways in which this gets abused. For example, we did in-person early absentee voting. The office put out an ad in the paper for weeks in advance of that date with a location and times for people to show up and cast their ballots early. Then right in the middle of it one of the local Republican candidates got an injunction against it claiming that the location was improper. Despite it being advertised for weeks, despite it being widely publicized, and despite not having any other good place to do it. Instead people who were planning to early absentee vote at the local precinct were instead expected to somehow get a ride down to the voter registration office. The very, very small voter registration office. That could have a grand total of three polling stations setup. We had lines that not only snaked through every hallway in the building, but also out the door and around the building twice. I guarantee you that court injunction disenfranchised voters, because I *know* there were people who gave up and left (I saw them do it). I *know* there were people complaining about the inconvenience, and there had to be others who either didn\u0027t make the extra effort, or couldn\u0027t for lack of a ride (or a few hours to wait around).\n\nThose people may not have had an opportunity to go request a mail-in absentee ballot at that point either, because it was pretty close to election day.\n\nYeah, this shit goes on every cycle.","duration":"","id":201,"color":"black","redditID":"t1_cvc336g","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":200,"links":[199],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"AntiMe","label":"Ok, at least you made an argument.

Here\u0027s the thing. What the military issues servicemembers are *Assault Rifles*. Please don\u0027t confuse this with *Assault Weapons*.\n\nAssault Rifles were developed after WWII and are defined as rifles that fire an intermediate cartridge (5.56 in the M16 for example), fully automatic and capable of select-fire modes (as in, semi/full auto/burst). Assault Rifles are termed that because the bullets they fire are smaller than Battle Rifles, which fire rounds such as 7.62 NATO. \n\n\"Assault Weapon\" is a political term that was used to ban firearms that had a collapsible stock (the butt end can be shortened/extended), pistol grip and a few other \"scary black tacticool\" features. The National Firearms Act from way back when already banned fully-automatic rifles from Civilians a long long time ago. The AR-15 is NOT fully automatic and neither are civilian AK47s. \n\n\"Assault Weapons\" are no deadlier than their wooden stock counterparts. They just look more menacing, and I don\u0027t think that is good enough grounds to ban something on. If you take a 5.56 semiautomatic rifle and put it in wooden housing and call it a hunting rifle, it\u0027s literally the same weapon as an AR-15. It just doesn\u0027t look as terrifying. Both guns will fire the same round, one round per trigger pull. Also, you should be aware that \"Grandpa\u0027s semi auto .308 or 30-06\" is probably more deadly than a semi auto AR15 since .308 can kill Elk, which tend to be bigger than most humans. \n\nI hope this distinction helped, because I\u0027m a little tired of the terms being conflated. People buy AR15s because they think they\u0027re cool. Same reason why I\u0027d rather drive a WRX than an Impreza.

But on the other side, Trudeau seems less \"Canadian identity\" oriented and it feels like he might have a bit of a Harper (USA Puppet) side to him. Then we get to the economy, and I have a lot more faith in Trudeau. He may have promised deficits, but it shows that he actually has a real plan, rather than trying to just sell the Liberal party. \n\nAt the end of the day, all I know is that I do not want to see a Conservative minority / majority ever again and if I have to sell out and vote for the #1 guy between NDP and Liberal just to make sure the Conservatives get fewer seats, I might. \n\nThis was a pretty cool website I ran into last night when looking at recent polls: votecompass.cbc.ca but you do have to take it with a grain of salt.

Ted Cruz is \"OK,\" and he\u0027s wrong on at least a few things, like net neutrality.  The problem most of you have with Cruz, aside from the obvious disagreement on policy, is how he (and a lot of other republicans) is (are) treated in the media.  Most of you think the media is fair and objective and it\u0027s really not.  You recognize the bias of Fox News because the Fox News bias does not align with your bias, but you fail to see the bias of news organizations that agree with you.  His gaffes are amplified, his statements are misconstrued or taken out-of-context, and the focus when covering him is on whatever it is you and the media outlets that share your bias disagree with most about him.  Think about everything Fox News says/does about/to democrats and realize the rest of the media does those same things, just not to democrats.\n\nCompare the image you (or at least some of our fellow Redditors) have of Cruz to who he actually is.  Most of you think he\u0027s some gibbering half-wit, but he graduated from Harvard Law School *magna cum laude* with a Juris Doctor degree.  Like President Obama, he was editor of the *Harvard Law Review*.  He was [touted as \"off the charts brilliant\" by Alan Dershowitz](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/who-is-ted-cruz/2012/08/01/gJQAqql8OX_blog.html), who was one of his professors.\n\nThe most important thing about Cruz is that he routinely opposes McConnell and Boehner when they\u0027re wrong (which is often).  There is a section of this party represented by guys like Boehner, McConnell, McCain, and Graham that does what the big donors want and a lot of us are more than a little tired of them and their shenanigans.  These are the guys that drove spending under President Bush to levels that should have been embarrassing even for democrats.  Cruz is not in that clique and is very vocal and active in opposing them which wins him a lot of leeway with the party base.\n\nTL;DR Ted Cruz is just \"OK.\"","duration":"","id":560,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_cvc8sti","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":559,"links":[558],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"pirateofspace","label":"I\u0027m not picking an argument, I\u0027m interested.

Cruz is not in that clique and is very vocal and active in opposing them which wins him a lot of leeway with the party base.\n\nTL;DR Ted Cruz is just \"OK.\"","duration":"","id":560,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_cvc8sti","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":559,"links":[558],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"pirateofspace","label":"I\u0027m not picking an argument, I\u0027m interested.

Yes, net neutrality is about that extra filter in the middle, about whether ISPs can flex their gatekeeper power between content providers and consumers. In a net neutral environment, ISPs are just the middle men, the source and content of traffic is irrelevant, so the profit incentive for the ISP is efficient data delivery. Keep in mind that YouTube also has an interest in reaching you, so under this system, ISPs and YouTube work together and make financial deals to deliver the data to you (the ISP is not just burdened all data costs on the back end).\n\nBut if the ISP could charge YouTube for prioritization, maybe just keeping it as the same speed it loads now, while relegating all other traffic to a slow delivery, then the NEXT YouTube, whatever that may be, is artificially priced out of the market--not based on any type of need for a fast-lane, but on an artificially imposed bandwidth shortage. That fast-lane has zero to do with whether YouTube functions on your end, and everything to do with whether YouTube and the ISP can engage in exclusive deals that limit market competition.

Regardless of whether or not that happens though, the new president names an FCC chair in 2018. It took a year for Wheeler to implement NN, so it\u0027s safe to assume that a conservative chair could un-implement it at least as quickly.\n\nBottom line: if a Republican wins in 2016 Net Neutrality will be gone by 2019.
