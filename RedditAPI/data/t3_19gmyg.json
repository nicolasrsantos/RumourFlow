During Bush, the left was fairly vocal about their disrespect for international strife, yet I believe the seeds of distention within America came during the 90\u0027s and thus I look for unpleasant facts that may ultimately garner weight to my argument. \n\nUltimately, I want to make a book that describes politics in the 90\u0027s from the growth of the internet to the scare of Y2K. There isn\u0027t a lot out there that has adequately summarized some of the biggest events that brought the United States to where it is today, but I think within those two moments there could be a wonderful story that describes a growing world of transparency juxtaposed between shadowy ordeals that the world remembers, but America\u0027s citizens are unaware of.
