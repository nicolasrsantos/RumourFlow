I'm not.\n\nThe thing people often forget or simply don't know that just as with people in general republicans are a wide variety of people. \n\nI used to identify as a republican. I grew up in a mostly rural town in southwestern Wisconsin. Until I was around 15 I didn't even know that evangelical, climate denying, control your bedroom, anti gay marriage republicans were a thing. It still baffles me that there are that many out there. Where I grew up it simply wasn't why people are conservative.\n\nPeople around here (not all mind you) care much more about free markets,low taxes, states rights, protecting constitutional rights, and individual rights such as property ownership. \n\nMost if they were a practicing church emmer kept it to them self, many use recreational drugs, some are against abortion but mostly just thought it was disgusting rather than a crime against humanity. People hooked up and did or didn't use BC and kept it a private affair between two people. All our schools have taught evolution and safe sex practices since the early to mid 1900s, not all but many people especially farmers and rural people have loved science at an early age.\n\nSure there are always idiots but everyone knew they were. The only guy I knew growing up that was legitimately and openly racist was my uncle, and while it's shitty in it's own right he turned out that way while in the navy back when affirmative action was a problem in the service.\n\nAll these people you see on tv and in the news are for the most part the equivalent of loud man hating feminists.  They are loud, they are outrageous thus they get airtime and talk time.\n\nIt's a terrible sad fact but many of \"republicans\" around here don't even like most of the republicans in office today. They hardly have a nice word to say about them. If your getting technical I'd call them more right libertarian than staunch republican.\n\nAnd you see this many places you travel. We talk about north and south, democrat and republican but it's so much more complex than that. There are a large number of republics EVERYWHERE even in traditional democrat states. Can you really expect all of them to be online with the majority in the southern states? \n\nAs I said it's a terrible tragedy but many (too many ) \"republicans\" vote as they do just because they feel that the lesser of two evils is better. I myself am not interested in the democrat platform it's simply not what I believe in. I just opt not to support republicans either. \n\nThis idea of democrats smart republics stupid is incredibly insulting and ignorant. Many people simply don't hold the same ideals that you do. That doesn't make them or yourself ignorant or stupid it means you have political differences like every other country on the planet.\n\nFuck, call Jeb bush an idiot all you want. But broad sweeping statements don't help your cause, it only makes you look elitist. \n\n\nJudging from your comments if wager you a democrat. I personally don't care for much of the liberal philosophy. But your not an idiot your an individual with a differing opinion on how the nation should be run. Nothing wrong with that. We will debate and vote and the best man win.\n\n\nSorry, buts it's sickening to listen to the \"oh if only we could just rid ourselves of these filthy idiots then we would live in utopia\" trope. \n\nNot everyone is the same. Whether or not the current republican platform strokes you as ignorant is irrelevant. In a diverse country of over 100 million people divided up into two parties it shouldn't be a surprise that there are masses of people who aren't exactly fitting into your republican stereotype.

They start twitching and spitting, yelling homophobic nonsense to each other and at the TV. The news announces Melissa has won by a slim, but definite margin!!!

An old woman in Arkansas has a heart attack from the shock. Groups of young, Confederate flag-yielding men in Georgia have taken to the streets, looting businesses and vandalizing homes of black families. Fox News begins a montage memorial program, commemorating what America used to be. Rush Limbaugh dies from a stroke. \n\nThe viewers on their couches have gotten so worked up at this point, they struggle to breath. Their TV dinners thrown to the side long ago in their rage, forgotten. Mac and cheese seeps into the carpet, staining grandma's nice rug.

Morally indefensible, but from a biblical standpoint they have just as much justification as the \"Jesus is Love\" Christians for their belief.\n\nI appreciate the quoting of Locke, but his point is pretty much my point. Because modern religion is interpretive instead of dogmatic there is no such thing as \"True Christianity\" or \"True Islam\" only the version you follow, or they follow, or those other guys follow. Because the objectively \"True\" version of a religion would be to follow the entire book, which would be great if it wasn't completely contradictory from one page to the next, and even THAT relies on the belief that the book itself is what defines the religion and not the people within it, which I don't think everyone would actually agree with either. \n\nYou can make up rules about what does and does not constitute \"True Islam\" all you want, but in the minds of ISIS fighters they are Muslims fighting for a Islamic Caliphate according to the teachings of Muhammed as they interpret them.

You hear the Westboro Baptist Church denounce homosexual marriage, Catholics, Jews, and picket funerals of dead children, gay people, soldiers, tornando victims, etc. to express their hate, but they don't represent the core of \"Jesus is Love\" represented by the majority of Christians worldwide. Neither do fig haters, but I digress.\n\nSimliarly, just because ISIS members behead Coptic Christians and cause terror does not mean that they represent the Islamic core of the *spiritual* struggle to become better people and serve God.\n\n&gt;Also, appealing to your \"hundreds of friends\" and their \"authority\" over what is and is not core, along with a hint of \"no true muslim\", in implying that ISIS followers can't be TRUE Muslims because of their beliefs, is simply a long list of well known logical fallacies. \n\nOn the one hand, I get the Ad Populum, Appeal to Authority and the classic \"No True Scotsman\" argument. But on the other hand, how does one tell which is the \"right\" interpretation of our religious beliefs? Quothe Locke's *Letter Concerning Tolerance*:\n\n&gt; *\"For whatsoever s ome people boast of the antiquity of places and names, or of the pomp of their outward worship; others, of the reformation of their discipline; all, of the orthodoxy of their faith —* ***for everyone is orthodox to himself*** *— these things, and all others of this nature, are much rather marks of men striving for power and empire over one another than of the Church of Christ.\" (Emphasis mine)*\n\nIf everyone believes that they have the right religious belief, then it is hard to establish what the \"TRUE\" religious belief is. Therefore, avoiding the \"No True Scotsman\" fallcy w.r.t. religion is a bit problematic, since a good number of religions all involve universal claims. All we can do is fall back to the outcome of what we *can* establish - the outcomes of what those individual beliefs are.\n\nFact: ISIS has killed Christians and Muslims who do not subject themselves to ISIS's ideology or authority.\n\nFact: ISIS has been condemned by mainstream Christian and Muslim authorities alike.\n\nFact: ISIS's actions will be judged, either here or in the afterlife, and I don't think the judge will think favourably of their executing civilians or using children as suicide bombers. And if the judge would judge favourably to them, I would call it a mistrial.\n\nISIS is a religious *extremist* (rather than a *religious* extremist) movement trying to establish a state based upon *its' own intepretation of* sharia law, and it has less to do with religion than a single belief. The belief that their Islam is correct *and that followers of the other branches of Islam, as well as believers of other religions, must die by the blade.* ***Even if they convert at gunpoint.***\n\nAnd that belief, that they can kill whoever they want because their individual belief system says so, is what makes ISIS a pariah organisation.","duration":"","id":1179,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_cp43xte","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1178,"links":[1177],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"Xerit","label":"What you define as the \"core\" of Islam, and what your friends define as the \"core\" of Islam may or may not be what ISIS followers define as the \"core\".\n\nThey certainly didn't get their ideas from Pastafarianism, or Marxism, or The Church of the Flying Pink Elephants.\n\nMuch like how modern Christians cherry pick the bible for only the cute and cuddly quotes, ignoring almost in its entirety the old testament and the parts of the new testament which disagree with them.

The Jews say, 'Ezra (Ozair) is a son of God'; and the Christians say, 'The Messiah is a son of God'. Such the sayings in their mouths! They resemble the sayings of the Infidels of old! God do battle with them! How are they misguided!..He it is who hath sent His Apostle with the Guidance and a religion of the truth, that He may make it victorious over every other religion, albeit they who assign partners to God be averse from it.\" (Sura 9:29-33).\n\n&gt;\"O Prophet! make war on the infidels and hypocrites, and deal rigorously with them. Hell shall be their abode! and wretched the passage to it!\" (Sura 66:9).\n\nIt's not that simple though.  \n\nOne of the issues we're dealing with is that there are different \"versions\" of the Quran, and it's not solidified, and the differing factions haven't drawn their lines in the sands as well.  \n\nLet's say we have the Christian bible, the Catholic bible and the John Smith Bible+Book of Mormon+all the other books the Mormon's have.  The Christians stopped at the bible, the Catholics added the Apocrypha, and the Mormon's changed the bible, and started adding books.  \n\nIn the same way we have differing muslim factions.  Some take only the peaceful parts, others add on \"Oh we get to kill people who won't join us\".  There are doctrines that say \"If a later writing contradicts a previous writing, the later writing takes precedent\", so there's that.  \n\nLets take the \"Jesus\" religions as an example.  They're really well factioned, and the differences are somewhat well defined (Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists, 7th day Adventists etc).   So lets say the 7th day Adventists added to their scriptures \"Anyone who doesn't join us, we totally get to kill\", and they start going to town.  Does that mean the Baptists are out murdering?  \n\nSince Islam isn't as well divided, it's really hard to put a name on the people killing \"infidels\" in the name of their god.  We really just need better organization on the differing branches of Islam.

Seriously.  Internet is good for that.\n\n&gt;Do you actively search for moderate Muslim opinions \n\nI mostly look at doctrinal writings, but I've talked to Muslims a few times on reddit and offline.  I'm not going to say they are all crazy lunatics, that's just false.  But plenty of times I talked to Muslims I walked away disappointed and sad.  They really don't say stuff I wish they would say.  And while I can see how they are aligning with the doctrine, in my mind I think, \"guys, don't you see how the doctrine is inadequate?\"  Of course once you become a true believer, and you accept that the doctrine is the word of the omniscient God, what chance is there to think critically about it?  So if you think I don't encounter this in a discussion with Muslims, you're wrong.\n\nAnyway, I don't really hate the individual Muslims, but I *am* concerned about the doctrine.  I worry that Muslims promote Islam without giving any thought to the impact the doctrine has on humanity.  I watched some conversion videos on youtube, and almost invariably the reason people convert to Islam is not because of the doctrine, but because of how good they feel about some Muslim friends on a personal level.  That's a serious concern because while these folks probably don't read all of Qur'an, don't read ahadith, don't study Muslim history in all their gory details, may not know what \"Deobandi thinking\" is and so on, they decide it's a good idea to support and directly or indirectly help spread this dangerous doctrine just because they feel good about a person.  That's just unsound thinking.  If you're going to adopt a religion, nice community is a good thing for sure, but **do** check out the doctrine first and foremost, and try to understand what it is you are spreading.\n\nAlso people who hide the ugly side of the doctrine while putting out fuzzy feelings up-front are dishonest salesmen.  You know how lots of people get converted?  From Sufism.  And Sufis don't talk about amputating limbs.  They don't get on a podium and get angry like a lot of Muslim clerics.  They smile.  They are kind.  They talk about nice fuzzy mystical stuff.  They never mention the harsh side of Islam.  So... on one hand, as Muslims, Sufis are probably some of the better people.  But as salesmen for Islam, Sufis are the most dishonest salesmen.  They put forward the very best of Islam, and absolutely obscure or even deny the worst.  I can even see myself hanging out with a Sufi sheikh and enjoying it.  But I would never convert to Islam.  And I would lean over and whisper into the sheikh's ear, \"Don't convert anyone to Islam... just share your spiritual wisdom as is.\"  And thankfully I even know of some sheikhs who do exactly that, but not enough, imo.\n\nHow many Muslims say stuff like this, \"Converting to Islam is free, but if you ever de-convert, be careful, because a lot of Muslims believe that ideally you should be punished by death for apostasy!\"  If Muslims talked this way, I bet they'd get a lot fewer converts.  That, and mentioning other similar things about Islamic doctrine, its often violent history and its often strict and intolerant culture would be an honest sales job at least.\n\nThing to remember is... while you may just want a bunch of cool buddies to hang with, someone else is going to read the doctrinal writings of Islam and actually take them both literally and seriously.  And then what?  What kind of world are we creating?","duration":"","id":56,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_c40gcuy","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":55,"links":[2],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"x86_64Ubuntu","label":"If there were moderates would you hear them on FOX news ?

Because religious identity, sadly, is a very important kind of identity, still, for a lot of people.\n\n&gt;Where are the Turkish suicide bombers?\n\nLet's wait.  Turkey is in the middle of Islamization.  Besides, Turkey's recent rulers have been militantly secularistic.  You can't give Turkey 100% credit for secularism that was not of their free will.  It's like giving USSR citizens credit for being atheistic at a time when atheism was a government mandate in USSR.  That's crooked thinking.\n\n&gt;Canadian?\n\nWest.\n\n&gt; German?\n\nWest.\n\n&gt;Swedish?\n\nWest.\n\n&gt;It's easy to blame Islam for some of the stupid shit muslim extremists do\n\nExtremism in the form of militancy is one of the problems.  But there are other problems.  Islamic attitude toward women.  Islamic attitude toward dogs and liquor.  Islamic ideas about punishment (very brutal and cruel).  Islamic attitude toward non-Muslims.  Islamic attitude toward apostasy.  In other words, even in a Muslim society where people don't strap the suicide vests on, you can often see the negative influence of Islam.  And the more Muslims in one place the worse it usually goes.  Muslims are at their best when they are very dispersed in low numbers across the West.  But get a bunch of them together, especially in the Middle East, Africa or India, and bad shit happens.  Militarism is just one bad dimension of Islam.  That's the jihad dimension.  But Islam has plenty of bad dimensions besides militarism.\n\n&gt;if you blame Islam you're going to have to label every single moderate Muslim a potential extremist\n\nModerate Muslims provide a comfortable and supportive atmosphere for the more serious Muslims.  They may not support extremism directly, but they support a Muslim who is marginally more serious.  Then the marginally more serious Muslims supports another marginally more serious Muslim.  And so on.  So at the end of the day, everyone plays a part in making Islam what it is.  Moderates make Islam what it is by their silence and apathy in the face of Islamic excesses.  Also, even moderates won't criticize the Qur'an.  \\*sigh\\*\n\nI don't want to sit here and pretend Islamic doctrine is acceptable when it isn't.  I don't want to slaughter every Muslim or anything like that.  In fact I want the wars to end as much as possible.  However, I also think we need to speak out about Islam.

Don't Christian crazies quote the Bible to justify the stupid shit they do?\n\nMost of the muslim extremists come from cultures that condone (or used to condone) the sort of stuff that makes you sick.  Christianity has had the benefit of several hundred years of development before Islam came around, which is why it's so splintered and oftentimes progressive.  The regions where the muslim crazies come from didn't have the benefit of an age of reason, secularization, democracy, human rights, etc.  They're mostly still living in a tribal-like setting with cultural norms and values that correspond to that sort of lifestyle.\n\nReligion is a part of it but it's not the whole picture..

Guy is one of the most fantastic people you'll ever meet but due to where we live he had trouble finding women whose parents wouldn't threaten murder for their white daughter dating a black man. Shit of it is, I'm sure he got plenty of flak from the other side for being so light skinned.  He even has green eyes  I grew up with him, my parents know him and how great he is. He's currently engaged to a white girl, one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen in my life. My mom disagrees due to the race issue. I told her honestly she should be fucking ashamed of herself for wanting to deny someone so great happiness just because of his skin color.  I've told her many times that I love her, but that I won't shed a tear when her generation and their mindset is laying in the fucking ground rotting.  I just...don't understand the hatred. I can't understand. It must run deep, deeper than I'll ever know, for her to feel that way toward someone I'd be happy to have a daughter of mine marry. \n\nI'm a 26 year old white male in Alabama...I don't understand the racism...but it runs deep and is going nowhere.

What pisses me off is that the feminist haven't given her shit over that. I have seen a lot of feminist video recently on YouTube attacking companies for marketing clothes with \"unrealist body shapes\", which in reality are \"healthy body shapes\" (from what I have seen from the companies receiving complaints).

They always say the same thing, yet are invariably guilty of the same - using verses out of context, ignoring the context altogether to suit their needs, or inferring \"divine\" laws that are never touched up in detail, or even referenced in the slightest for that matter.\n\nGood times.","duration":"","id":81,"color":"black","redditID":"t1_codrd84","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":80,"links":[73],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"Seakawn","label":"The foundation of violence and the level of promotion of said violence differs fundamentally from the Christian and Islamic doctrines.

A doctrinal difference between Christianity and Islam is that in Christianity, the doctrines fundamental principles of peace and selfless love resists the more primitive and barbaric scriptures, but with Islam, anything in the doctrine that promotes peace is later abrogated by the conversion by sword principles.\n\nYou can point to the bad bible verses all day long but will just be met with some New Testament abrogation of those verses. It's the other way around for Islam. That's a dangerous and significant difference.\n\nBasically, you can use the Christian doctrine to decouple violence from Christian religious principles. You *can not* use Islamic doctrine to decouple violence from Islamic religious principles. Just because these two religions have both promoted violence from its followers does not mean they are both analogous in relation to their philosophy on aggressive behavior. Christian doctrine contains a leash on the violence in the New Testament. Islamic doctrine has no leash on its violence other than the sand-burying reaction of the individual Muslim and their comprehension of their own holy scripture.","duration":"","id":80,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_codqpmv","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":73,"links":[72],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"RamboGoesMeow","label":"A prime example of that is how people always point out \"Only Muslims want to kill people for not believing in their ways!\" despite the fact that the Bible talks about killing apostates, and those that turn from their faith, etc. You'll hear excuses such as \"Well that's the OT\" or \"You have to understand the context\" or \"That only applied to Israelites\", so on and so forth.

Like it or not, horrendous torture happened during the Inquisition and the era of slavery, both of which were justified using biblical scripture. And the argument that the Crusades — which resulted in the deaths of untold thousands — were only in response to Muslim provocation is highly contested among historians.\nMore importantly, while these events are long past, these critics are apparently tone deaf to the numerous modern examples of violence perpetrated by people claiming to represent Christ. In 2011, Anders Behring Breivik, a self-professed Christian, launched a horrific assault in Oslo, Norway to defend “Christian Europe,�? using an arsenal of weapons to kill 77 people — most of whom were teenagers. In November of last year, suspected Christian terrorist Larry McQuilliams mounted a full-scale attack on Austin, Texas, firing off more than 100 shots in the city before embarking on a botched attempt to burn down the Mexican Consulate. And in central Africa, the Lord’s Resistance Army (which, similar to ISIS, seeks to establish a theocratic state based on the Ten Commandments) forcibly recruits child soldiers, terrorizes local villages, and is thought to be responsible for the deaths of 100,000 people in Uganda and the displacement of 1.7 million in the greater region, according to the United Nations.\nOne wonders if Jackson and others would be so willing to “defend�? Christianity’s apparently sinless history to the faces of those 60,000 to 100,000 child soldiers, youngsters who were ripped from their homes, tortured brutally, and forced by the LRA to run needlessly into battle — all ostensibly in the name of Christ.","duration":"","id":681,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_codnyzf","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4,"level":5,"title":"Obama Is Right: Christian Violence Is Just as Bad as Muslim Violence—Or Worse","label":"spaceghoti","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_2v01jp","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1423271335,"simScore":0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1423300188,"simScore":0.7781593493134418,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":682,"links":[0],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"mysticreddit","label":"Uh, violence is violence.

Perhaps, Republicans are more likely to be unable to create their own political opinion because they have not ever had to hold beliefs that were different from their community.  If you accept whatever is commonly believed by your peers then you don't need to start generating your own opinions.

A global terrorist organization like al Qaeda which wasn't linked to or run by any particular nation simply didn't fit into how they saw the world working, so it was difficult to convince them of the threat.  One of the main offenders was Dr. Rice, who was a Soviet specialist - throughout her life, education and professional experience, all the \"actors\" in the world were either nation-states themselves or direct proxies.\n\nThe other element that they struggled with was the fact that to whatever small degree al Qaeda was linked to any particular nation, that nation was Saudi Arabia.  Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice and others all had professional and personal experience in the oil industry, where Saudis are important players.  Bush himself has many Saudi personal friends.  The fact that one of the main threats to our security was a Saudi-funded group, which was made up of many Saudis was hard to reconcile.\n\nThese facts were both part of why they had a hard time recognizing the severity of the threat posed by al Qaeda, and why even after 9/11/2001, they focused on the absurd idea that Iraq/Saddam Hussein had anything to do with the attacks.  When you only see nation-state-actors, and you are friendly to Saudi Arabia, the main regional opponent of Saudi Arabia sure looks like a good target.\n\nThis doesn't make the success of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks exclusively or even primarily the fault of the Bush administration, but it certainly points out some of their limitations which contributed to the problem.","duration":"","id":17,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_c6784kk","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":16,"links":[5],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"mdot","label":"&gt;What would you have done differently?\n\nInteresting point...\n\nThe main theme of the article that was linked, was that the intelligence community was trying desperately to get the White House to even *recognize* that there was an imminent threat.\n\nMaybe the WH could have asked the CIA if they had identified any of the members of the group.

They had a singular focus, and they were not going to let themselves get sidetracked by \"reports\".\n\nOf course, 9/11 *did* eventually end up sidetracking them, but only temporarily. The Bush administration would have invaded Iraq whether 9/11 happened or not, it was their policy from the beginning.\n\nThis comes not just from the linked article, it's stuff I've read over the course of the years. This article does seems agree with, and tie together, all of these other scattered reports regarding the Bush administration, 9/11 and Iraq.\n\nPersonally, I think that this is people trying to save their own \"reputations\" of that whole fiasco that was the Bush administration. Now that time has passed, and there's not much political cost for speaking out against the Bush administration...they're all coming out of the woodwork to say, \"It wasn't me! I was one of the people that was trying to tell them what they were doing was wrong!\"\n\nI'm glad the real story is getting out. However, anybody that is speaking out now, instead of when it could have really made a difference, is a fucking coward and not worthy of having a \"good reputation\".","duration":"","id":18,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_c679j5f","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":17,"links":[16],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"tomdarch","label":"A very important component of what was going on the the minds of Bush administration officials was the minset that only nation states were important.  A global terrorist organization like al Qaeda which wasn't linked to or run by any particular nation simply didn't fit into how they saw the world working, so it was difficult to convince them of the threat.  One of the main offenders was Dr. Rice, who was a Soviet specialist - throughout her life, education and professional experience, all the \"actors\" in the world were either nation-states themselves or direct proxies.\n\nThe other element that they struggled with was the fact that to whatever small degree al Qaeda was linked to any particular nation, that nation was Saudi Arabia.  Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice and others all had professional and personal experience in the oil industry, where Saudis are important players.  Bush himself has many Saudi personal friends.  The fact that one of the main threats to our security was a Saudi-funded group, which was made up of many Saudis was hard to reconcile.\n\nThese facts were both part of why they had a hard time recognizing the severity of the threat posed by al Qaeda, and why even after 9/11/2001, they focused on the absurd idea that Iraq/Saddam Hussein had anything to do with the attacks.  When you only see nation-state-actors, and you are friendly to Saudi Arabia, the main regional opponent of Saudi Arabia sure looks like a good target.\n\nThis doesn't make the success of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks exclusively or even primarily the fault of the Bush administration, but it certainly points out some of their limitations which contributed to the problem.","duration":"","id":17,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_c6784kk","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":16,"links":[5],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"mdot","label":"&gt;What would you have done differently?\n\nInteresting point...\n\nThe main theme of the article that was linked, was that the intelligence community was trying desperately to get the White House to even *recognize* that there was an imminent threat.\n\nMaybe the WH could have asked the CIA if they had identified any of the members of the group. Maybe they ask if they may know the whereabouts of any members of the group.\n\nMaybe they could have just said, \"Man, this seems serious.

We aren't talking about other religions so it would be entirely irrelevant.\n\n&gt;You can bring up these statistics to contend that Muslims are more likely to be violent or that they are bad people, but that does not actually prove causation\n\nSo what? If a study found that 33% of all drug dealers committed violent felonies, would you just scoff at the statistic and say \"correlation isn't causation\"? It would be very difficult to prove that the drug dealing itself is what caused the violence (well, maybe not in this particular analogy but I think you can see where I'm going with this) but you can be damn well sure that violence is prevalent among drug dealers; it would be an inescapable fact, just like extremism is prevalent among muslims.\n\nYou've missed my entire point. Yourdadsbff said he/she believe that it's sadder that people believe Obama is a Muslim than that people believe being Muslim is bad. As I pointed out, there is no reason to believe Obama is Muslim, but there is however reason to believe Muslims are prone to violent acts in the name of their religion. The point I was trying to convey in one statement would be this: it's sadder to believe something without evidence for it (Obama being a muslim) than it is to believe something that has evidence for it (Muslims are prone to violence).\n","duration":"","id":13,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_c6ydcla","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":12,"links":[11],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"diabeatles","label":"I am not going to refute any of your statistics on what Muslims believe it justified or not in terms of religion, nor will I bring up the heinous acts committed by Christians (or any religion) done in the name of said religion and the amounts of people who believe they are justified.

It is highly unlikely that cabba literally believes or meant that all over 50s are ignoramuses guilty of the sins he describes - just that too high a percentage of them are. Use of the word 'all' was blatant hyperbole, and you are seeking drama by choosing to interpret this single word literally, when the context contraindicates this.

I merely inferred.\n\nAnyhow, the seniors who participated in NASA and the formation of the internet, while over 50, are hardly likely to be part of the idiotic know-nothing demographic about which cabbadabbadoo complained. This was my point. If your objection to cabba was just that some 50+ year olds did cool, intelligent things like NASA, then your point was irrelevant: cabbadabbadoo was clearly not talking about all 50+ year olds, but rather a subset of 50+ year olds in which most NASA engineers/scientists would not be included:the idiots. You can call this subset whatever you like. Because of the high correlation, I called it the Tea Party in my post. Semantics.\n\nEDIT: also, you make a lot of assumptions about his parents. He could be a voter and still have parents under 40.

If a challenger can quickly and clearly identify a falsehood, FOX loses face. Even on a non-level playing field, one can only push things so far.\n\nAlso, faithful viewers might occasionally interact with the world outside of the right-wing echo chamber. If FOX lies are sufficiently transparent, even brief exposure to the real world might pierce a hole in their bubble of ignorance.\n\nI don't necessarily claim that FOX is above lying. Rather, I think they're smart enough to realize that doing so is not in their best interest. At a minimum, prevarications must be sufficiently complex that they can't be disproven in a matter of seconds. Or better yet, FOX can present information that is factually accurate yet intentionally misleading (\"Chrysler will build Jeeps in China\"), cover their asses with question marks (\"Is Obama a US citizen?\"), hide behind anonymous third parties (\"some people are saying...\"), [etc](http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/1964:fourteen-propaganda-techniques-fox-news-uses-to-brainwash-americans).\n\nOf course there are zealots that will ignore irrefutable evidence. Perhaps that's the majority of FOX's audience. However, not *all* viewers are equally blind. And FOX is presumably trying to expand its audience as well. As Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh can attest, everyone is subject to market forces.\n\nAs for the unidirectionality of FOX's fact-fudging, I believe that's a consequence of a couple factors. First of all, it's a conservative organization so they're only trying to push the limit in one direction. The situation is analogous to drivers getting more tickets for speeding rather than going too slow. A second factor might be that, within left wing circles, pro-liberal errata wouldn't get much publicity.\n\nI hate to defend FOX News but it's galling that we uncritically accept the argument that every falsehood is intentional. It's shit like this that propagates the \"'r/politics' is a circlejerk\" meme.","duration":"","id":72,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cclzbo3","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":71,"links":[70],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"DukeOfGeek","label":"Why?

Tax the churches in the same way as everyone else. If they want to be nonprofits, give them the same nonprofit options secular organizations have, with the same restrictions.\n\nIf you really mean \"no fucking laws\", that implies laws don't apply to churches.

Last time I checked, IRS agents were still flammable.\n\nSo you believe that whenever a government doesn't allow a church to do *whatever it wants,* it's time to burn down the government?\n\nWow, you're *so* much better than those Muslims. They only believe that whenever a government doesn't allow a mosque to do whatever it wants, it's time to burn down the government.\n\nAnd if you want to see what it looks like when the religious side wins, just look at the Muslim world.

Why can't they engage in politics?\n\nin my mind, it's because nobody should be able to put undue pressure on someone else in order to influence their vote.  many people in this country consider their religious leaders to have more authority over their lives than the laws do.\n\nin order for anyone to be prosecuted for a crime, they must first be caught by someone in law enforcement.  but with the indoctrination that \"god is always watching\" and that \"your immortal soul hangs in the balance\", people will be far more likely to act in accordance to what their religious beliefs deem \"legal\", even if that's in direct violation with the laws of the land.  because they think god is going to prosecute them in the afterlife.\n\nso even if you agree with candidate A on foreign affairs, taxes, spending, education, energy policy, and health care, and you think candidate B's plans won't work across the board, if a religious authority says \"candidate A is a horrible, immoral person, and goes against god's word.  a vote for candidate A is as bad as committing the same sins yourself!  but candidate B is a man of god!\" then you're going to be morally torn.  do you vote for the person whose policies you know make sense and will be good for the country?  or do you follow the dictate of your religious leader and \"save your immortal soul\"?","duration":"","id":86,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_c6t0xdw","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":85,"links":[84],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"stult","label":"Well Political Action Committees (501(c)(4) and 527 organizations) are not taxed on income (i.e. donations) that they spend lobbying on those same issues that you list as examples of churches engaging in politics in the guise of charity. So the tax subsidy for such activities extends way beyond churches. And is probably much more significant in the case of PACs than 501(c)(3)s. \n\nI think that this aspect of religious taxation is actually relatively unimportant but is illustrative of a much bigger set of problems. Political speech is just on example of how churches are carrying on activities that don't look anything like what the drafters of the tax code had in mind when creating exemptions for religious organizations. I think it is also important to remember that non-charitable religious activities can also be very beneficial and there are good reasons to avoid interfering with them. Many people derive a lot of happiness and comfort from attending religious services. Most religious organizations are not run for profit and so would have a difficult time surviving if taxed. Personally I see no problem with traditional, core religious activities being exempt from taxation (though I am not sure whether the corresponding charitable deduction granted to those who donate to churches is a good thing). The problem is when churches stop looking like churches and start looking like empires.\n\nCurrently, 501(c)(3) organizations risk losing their tax-exempt status if they engage in political activities, if we ignore for the sake of discussion the lack of enforcement. But why? Why can't they engage in politics? I think that part of the idea was to maintain separation of church and state, by restraining religious organizations from being too active in politics. This seems like a weak justification in light of the First Amendment, which protects free speech. Why should religious leaders have less freedom of speech? Without going into the jurisprudence too much, this justification would almost certainly not hold up to a Constitutional challenge in court.\n\nI think the better and more likely explanation is that the rule allows people to give to churches and charitable organizations without having to fear that money be used for political purposes with which they do not agree. For example, a Catholic may vehemently oppose abortion and lobby for that extensively, but simultaneously may recognize that keeping the Church out of politics is important for the Church and our secular democracy. But again I have doubts as to whether this would hold up in court.\n\nEither way, I don't think political speech in churches is as significant of an issue as how many (c)(3) organizations appear to be carrying out activities that are not closely related to their legal purposes and the justifications for their tax exemption. 501(c)(3)s must be organized and run exclusively for one of a set of statutorily specified purposes, including religious, scientific, educational, charitable, and other purposes. Charity and religion are separate purposes, either or both of which suffice for (c)(3) status. Once an organization has that status, it is exempt from nearly all income taxation. That includes income from investments, of which the Mormon Church notoriously has many. \n\nThe assumption at the time the rule was written is that charitable organizations would not be run for profit and would not accrue significant wealth and economic power. The law is written so that it is illegal for a (c)(3) to have any owners or shareholders to whom profit is dispensed. Thus, unlike a corporation that issues dividends to shareholders, there would be no profit motive for a (c)(3). However, Mormon leaders have used the Church as a tool for empire building. Scientologists have done the same. Even though the leadership does not directly benefit in the form of profits, a wealthier church gives them more personal power and increases the opportunities for them to personally profit via increased benefits and salary. They have done so while simultaneously carrying out relatively few of the beneficial activities that we consider worthy of a tax subsidy.\n\nOn the other hand, many religious organizations are nothing like the Mormons or Scientologists. There are many small non-denominational churches that could not survive without the tax subsidy. They don't engage in the political activities so many here on Reddit object to. They are often active charitably in their communities and certainly provide comfort and happiness to hundreds of thousands of Americans. While you may not agree with their religion, I think it is fair to say that these organizations can be very beneficial and are worthy of tax exemption.\n\nBut how do we distinguish between the empire-builders and the 'good' churches? I think PAC taxation demonstrates one viable approach. The tax code specifies that any income received by a PAC is tax-exempt to the extent that it is used for specified exempt purposes. PACs are technically supposed to be taxed on any income put towards non-exempt purposes, meaning those that are not intended to affect an election. Whether that law is enforced is unclear, but I'd say it is only lightly enforced if at all. That's partly attributable to the relatively recent explosion in PACs. There haven't been enough people abusing the system to attract IRS attention yet. \n\nWe could arrange a similar regime for churches, whereby we would not tax a church on income put toward charitable purposes but would tax income put toward non-exempt purposes, such as paying the salary of a preacher that engages in political speech or income invested in or received from businesses. The trick is crafting a rule that protects the activities we think are worthy of a tax subsidy versus those that are not. \n","duration":"","id":85,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_c6sz613","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":84,"links":[83],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"sluggdiddy","label":"And lots not forget.. a lot of the \"charity\" work consists opposing gay rights and abortion(and secularism, science, education. etc etc.).

He wasn't greedy and would hire all the men in the town who were struggling even though they might not have been the best workers he still knew they needed the work. He would buy his workers lunch every day and he always rounded their hours up a few hours to make them even. He was ruined by a greedy church that somehow used their religion to make money even though their entire religion is against worldly stuff like money.

Churches for the most part have gone along with it for the most part, I'm guessing mainly to avoid a costly legal battle.  Although incidents that have cropped up here and there aren't usually pursued by government.  My guess is because government knows that forcing a church to pay a tax if they decide to speak out politically will be found to be a violation of the first amendment and when government loses it would open the flood gates to political discourse in church and sermons.

They polled roughly 3,000 people on ~2K landlines and 1K cellphones.  Then they *weighted responses based on TWO DIFFERENT SOURCES of demographic data*.  In other words, because generally only old people and the morbidly unoccupied bother to give their opinions to a stranger over the phone (the rest of us have kids/friends/jobs/better things to do), they straight up INVENT responses/respondents that did not exist in real life to generate their end product.\n\nI don't think this kind of weighting works, I think polling agencies know this and therefore refuse to release this part of their methodology, and in my experience response bias is the most confounding obstacle facing phonebank polling.  Furthermore, I don't think there has been much scholarship in the vein of how cellphone respondents may differ from landline respondents, not just in terms of demographics, but their thoughtfulness, distractions, etc...if I'm at the bus stop and I'm taking a phone poll, maybe I'm worried about what the people around me are hearing.\n\ntl;dr: Don't put too much weight behind these numbers because Pew's methodology is:\n1.) Poll a bunch of old people, mostly by landline\n2.) ?????\n3.)
