In reading the water gate wiki page, it became fairly clear that there were very few people in high places who wanted to help cover this up (at least compared to other coverups). This was an infiltration of the democratic party, an entity already in the back pocket of the higher ups, so it I can\u0027t see any motive on their part—as far as I can tell, the top guy in Watergate was Nixon (pretty rare). I assumed that maybe, seeing as it didn\u0027t involve the CIA or implicate any member of the \u0027permanent government\u0027, that they were just a \u0027eh, you\u0027re on your own bud\u0027 kind of thing. But then, in conversing with another poster here, he mentioned that this occurred at the height of Mockingbird, and that it was Washington Post and NYT (the 2 biggest mocking bird players at the time) who jumped on the story. Here\u0027s his exact response:\n\n\"So I would argue that Watergate was a calculated political event in \u0027deep politics\u0027. The establishment lost use of their \u0027figurehead\u0027 and benefited from feeding him to the wolves, essentially. It paved the way for Reagans election in 80, for HW Bush\u0027s appointment by ford to director of central intelligence in 76, it purged much of the liberal elements of the republican party (nixon and his posse were pretty liberal outside of his warmongering), it placated the populace who thought they were making a stand against the policies of the last decade.\n\n\"This is interesting: When watergate broke, it was the height of operation mockingbird and the NYT and Washington Post jumped on the story like rabid dogs, both primary mockingbird institutions so there was definitely an agenda with that. One of the writers for WaPo was Carl Bernstein, who immediately after his famous watergate reporting left the WaPo and began investigating the CIAs relationship with the media, so clearly he realized something was up and wanted to learn more about it. He is one of the best resources for what we know about mockingbird today.\"\n\nI have yet to, in my own research, verify much of this (except the parts about mockingbird, WaPo and NYT), but he has yet to steer me wrong so I am inclined to hold this as a place holder of the assumed situation until I get time to look into it further. \n\nI\u0027m told Peter Scott Dale has some good work in this subject (I\u0027ve read one of his JFK essay and he *really* gets into the nitty gritty—honestly, a little too much so that it makes it hard to see the big picture) for those looking to further understand this information.

What the truth actually is we will never know unless we get a real independent investigation, but when armed with even the information which is more or less irrefutable, it\u0027s pretty clear that protocols which would have prevented these attacks were not followed; dozens, if not hundreds, of warning were ignored; and it\u0027s pretty hard to honestly argue that the US did not at least allow these attacks to happen. \n\nhopefully even with my amateur understanding of all this I have done a fair job of shining some light, and some context on these questions.

In reading the water gate wiki page, it became fairly clear that there were very few people in high places who wanted to help cover this up (at least compared to other coverups). This was an infiltration of the democratic party, an entity already in the back pocket of the higher ups, so it I can\u0027t see any motive on their part—as far as I can tell, the top guy in Watergate was Nixon (pretty rare). I assumed that maybe, seeing as it didn\u0027t involve the CIA or implicate any member of the \u0027permanent government\u0027, that they were just a \u0027eh, you\u0027re on your own bud\u0027 kind of thing. But then, in conversing with another poster here, he mentioned that this occurred at the height of Mockingbird, and that it was Washington Post and NYT (the 2 biggest mocking bird players at the time) who jumped on the story. Here\u0027s his exact response:\n\n\"So I would argue that Watergate was a calculated political event in \u0027deep politics\u0027. The establishment lost use of their \u0027figurehead\u0027 and benefited from feeding him to the wolves, essentially. It paved the way for Reagans election in 80, for HW Bush\u0027s appointment by ford to director of central intelligence in 76, it purged much of the liberal elements of the republican party (nixon and his posse were pretty liberal outside of his warmongering), it placated the populace who thought they were making a stand against the policies of the last decade.\n\n\"This is interesting: When watergate broke, it was the height of operation mockingbird and the NYT and Washington Post jumped on the story like rabid dogs, both primary mockingbird institutions so there was definitely an agenda with that. One of the writers for WaPo was Carl Bernstein, who immediately after his famous watergate reporting left the WaPo and began investigating the CIAs relationship with the media, so clearly he realized something was up and wanted to learn more about it. He is one of the best resources for what we know about mockingbird today.\"\n\nI have yet to, in my own research, verify much of this (except the parts about mockingbird, WaPo and NYT), but he has yet to steer me wrong so I am inclined to hold this as a place holder of the assumed situation until I get time to look into it further. \n\nI\u0027m told Peter Scott Dale has some good work in this subject (I\u0027ve read one of his JFK essay and he *really* gets into the nitty gritty—honestly, a little too much so that it makes it hard to see the big picture) for those looking to further understand this information.

A similar question I have been looking into recently was how did Watergate get exposed—I don\u0027t have all the answers but it\u0027s starting to get clearer. \n\nAlso, in reading your comments, it seems your question is \"If this got exposed how could the US have done 9/11\", in which case I will try to provide some context as to why this is apples vs oranges. \n\nI would first like to ask, wasn\u0027t \"Iraq never had WMD\u0027s\" a \u0027conspiracy theory\u0027 for a fair amount of time? I could be wrong but if anyone who has more info could provide a little info on this that would be appreciated.\n\nIn regards to the war, I haven\u0027t done too much research (yet)—Only been around for about a year and there is so much geopolitical and conspiracy information to make sense of everything that it hasn\u0027t been a priority—so I can only offer speculation based on my understanding of similar events but:\n\nIt seems, to me any way, that Iraq wasn\u0027t exactly part of \u0027the plan\u0027. \u0027They\u0027 (Intelligence Agencies, \u0027Shadow Government\u0027 NGO\u0027s, etc) supported Saddam for a long while, as is common with these types of things—the CIA overthrows democratically elected leaders to install puppet dictators who will do their bidding. Unfortunately, the CIA is much better at overthrowing democracies than they are at overthrowing dictatorships ([1](http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/CIAtimeline.html), [2](http://www.thepeopleshistory.net/p/series-peoples-history-of-cia.html)). As has happened with many US-installed dictators, they get cocky and try to buck the system. I have yet to do much research on what exactly happened that caused the first Gulf War, but Saddam did this in [late 2000](http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/10/30/iraq.un.euro.reut/) by trying to sell his countries oil in euros—a direct attack against US financial dominance over oil, and on the petrodollar system ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dHP7L8bw5QF4), [2](http://www.thepeopleshistory.net/2013/06/understanding-petrodollar-means.html)). Same thing happened to Libya in when Gaddaffi started working towards a gold-backed dinar to replace the dollar for oils sales ([1](http://rt.com/news/economy-oil-gold-libya/)). Thankfully we put a stop to that nonsense when we overthrow Gaddaffi in 2011. Same thing is happening right now with Iran. Iran, or more specifically, the strait of hormuz, is seemingly the centerpiece to all of this. Right now we are framing their best buddies, the Syrian government, with chemical weapons because (for reasons which I have yet to understand) we don\u0027t want to or cannot directly deal with Iran. \n\nIt\u0027s also important to understand that Iraq, Libya, Syria, Iran, all these countries, are very short term things. \u0027Covering tracks\u0027 so to speak is not a black or white thing—you only need to fool the people long enough to get you in there, then you got that shit in the bag. There is no necessity for it to hold up 10 or even 5 years later. What\u0027s the public gonna do? Post a snide comment against the Bush administration on reddit?  They (the real string pullers not lolbush)  know the public doesn\u0027t really give a shit about anything because they [shadow government] helped to engineer it. And they, as was finally made big news in recent months, have everything you\u0027ve ever done on the internet at their finger tips so I assume gauging public opinion is not that difficult. the CIA has been wiretapping and tracking people for at least 50 years (to my knowledge, not to the extent that the NSA is though). \n\nWhat\u0027s the UN gonna do? Wag their fist as the US in a meeting hall? Most of them are sympathetic to US interests, and when our military expenditures trump the sum of every other country in the world, I don\u0027t think any individual country who isn\u0027t would be dumb enough to start asking questions else they get a nice dose of freedom dropped on their heads. Of course, it seems, with Iraq at least, there was enough lack of control over the situation by the US, and a lack of necessity to put too much effort into the cover story, to result in the exposing that Iraq never had WMD\u0027s.\n\nThe Iraq war has more or less come to a close (Right?), or at least US troops are being withdrawn while private contractors are being put in. \"Iraq never had WMD\u0027s\" become official [this year](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/18/panorama-iraq-fresh-wmd-claims) (if there is a further back new sources, please correct me). The wars already over. What are people gonna do? All that can really happen is \"Oh, well we won\u0027t get fooled next time!\". Iraq was inconsequential in the broad scale of things. You don\u0027t need someone to believe their whole lives that you conned them—only long enough for you to get what you wanted.\n\n9/11, however, is much different. 9/11 issued in a whole  new era. 9/11 was the pretext for endless war, \u0027the war on terror\u0027, TSA, NSA, Patriot Act, NDAA, so on and so forth.  There was much more at stake with 9/11 , and there was much more control of the situation. 9/11 10, 20, even 50  years later ( I doubt the US will exist in 50 years, but regardless), turning out to be a lie would be *huge*. Iraq never having WMD\u0027s? Not so much. murdering your own people, on your own land is much different than lying about the reasons for a war. People are desentizied to this. We\u0027ve been at war for 214 of our 236 years as a country and we\u0027ve been coerced, manipulated, and lied to for most of them (and we generally know it)—We\u0027re used to that. It\u0027s depressing but it\u0027s true. However, the \u0027government\u0027 killing it\u0027s own people, we\u0027re not used to that, and thus if it [9/11 as an \u0027inside job\u0027] was true, it\u0027s implications are much more concerning to most.
