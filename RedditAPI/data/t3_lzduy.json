Regardless, I also refuse to take the stretch of logical reasoning to say \"Perry\" did it because he doesn\u0027t like black people (because he had a ranch with a sign that said Niggerhead). I can see how these two ideas are reasonable and potentially connected, but I will not spread either rumor until I see citations.\n\nIn the mean time, I will wonder if it was the Perry campaign that released this information. Because, from a political standpoint, opposition research on other primary candidates is not particularly out of the ordinary - and sending that info to the press when your candidate is down in the polls is also not out of the ordinary.\n\nSo yeah, I won\u0027t link this to \"Perry\u0027s\" racism yet, so much as I will wonder if Perry\u0027s campaign conducted the research that led to this coming out.\n\nWhat I do want to know is how the media, whether it be blogs, television stations, or print-media, failed to check in with the National Restaurant Association about just such background history with this presidential candidate (Cain) within the first two weeks of his campaign. It seems to me that while Fox News is to blame for their assbackwards way of \u0027covering\u0027 these events, the media more generally, regardless of outlet, should have uncovered all of this long before another Republican had to use opposition research to uncover it.","duration":"","id":52,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c2wukva","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Oh Fox News, you slay me...","label":"itsmisterrogers","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_lzduy","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.320380165E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.320387986E9,"simScore":0.6881940655728886,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":53,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"thurrs","label":"Mister Rogers give me some links backing up your claims please.","duration":"","id":53,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c2wvwjs","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Oh Fox News, you slay me...","label":"itsmisterrogers","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_lzduy","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.320380165E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.320396026E9,"simScore":0.6825999941144671,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":54,"links":[53],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"itsmisterrogers","label":"Just posted links at the top.","duration":"","id":54,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_c2wxyo3","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":53,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"thurrs","label":"Mister Rogers give me some links backing up your claims please.","duration":"","id":53,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c2wvwjs","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Oh Fox News, you slay me...","label":"itsmisterrogers","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_lzduy","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.320380165E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.320396026E9,"simScore":0.6825999941144671,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.320409925E9,"simScore":0.5649107077292034,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":55,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"sillyturd","label":"CNN is drafting behind FOX.
