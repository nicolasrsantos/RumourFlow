I\u0027m no medical expert, but from my understanding UTIs are much more common in uncircumcised baby boys. I, personally am not a fan of circumcision, but I can almost empathize a little with a parent who might just be trying to make their baby healthier and more comfortable (UTIs are typically not dangerous from what I know, but they can lead to kidney infections. I have no clue about the risks of UTIs in infancy though).\n\nIs this strong enough to warrant an operation? No. Probably not. Maybe in extreme cases? I don\u0027t even know if they exist! I think that people think of circumcising a baby like they do piercing the ears--a \"procedure\" if you will, not really an \"operation\". \n\nThere is a book titled: \"As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as A Girl\" (I have seen a documentary about it also), it really paints a picture of why parents may look into circumcision (or be guided there by a physician to help the baby), the fucking dangers of it, and lots more--its a great read; although it is insanely tragic. The book really sealed the deal as far as being con-circumcision on my part.","duration":"","id":27,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_c5zo6v6","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":26,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"thesloth17","label":"How much sex are these babies having that it\u0027s so important to protect them from HIV/STI\u0027s?
