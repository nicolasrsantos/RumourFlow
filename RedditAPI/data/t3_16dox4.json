daughter of jacob and maria regehr and the sister of jacob henry willie irma edna and leo she was known in her family for her intellect and hunting skills but was discriminated against at school because her parents were immigrants and her first language was low german she earned her bachelors degree magnum cum laude in  and a masters degree with high honors from the university of saskatchewan she studied for two years at mcgill university and then earned her phd from the university of minnesota in  she was married to john burt clark from  to  during which time she started her family and as an entrepreneur invented and patented pink puff and wrote and copyrighted the three owls a reading method for children without middleclass european backgrounds she began her scientific career in  researching the biochemistry of cell ion channels especially their response to alcoholism at indiana university bloomington with alfred strickholm her impulse toward selfhelp and practical application led her to establish a nutritional consulting practice in the late s as a complement to her university research when her federal research funds were eliminated after the recession of  she left the university expanded her consulting practice and established an independent research program based on her patient outcomes consulting and independent research on all aspects of human disease especially cancer was the focus of her life thereafter she published seven books describing her findings and how ordinary people could use them to improve their health and she established a clinic in tijuana mexico where she treated patients conducted research and trained others in her methods her observations conclusions and methods were and are controversial and attracted lawsuits and unwanted attention from government regulators which handicapped her work despite threats and intimidation her conviction optimism and universally forgiving outlook allowed her to pursue her clinical practice and research without fear until she was  she is survived by her three sons geoffrey allen clark married to charlotte scullin clark douglas burt walcerz married to elba ivette rohena and robert john clark

all who supported and advanced her work during her lifetime and her dream was that her work will be carried on by others memorial donations can be made to amnesty international the unitarian universalist service committee or the american civil liberties union  i first heard of dr hulda clark when i bought her book the cure for all diseases at the edgar cayce bookstore in virginia beach va i told my friend that id better buy it now before it becomes unavailable little did i know that dr clark did indeed have problems with her first publisher and therefore established her own publishing company publishing books others would not touch it is a great loss to learn of dr clarks passing she like edgar cayce had a special gift mr cayce could reveal what was hidden with a direct connection to another world by falling into a selfinduced trance dr clark revealed the inner workings of the material world with her own tools notably the syncrometer dr clark was not religious she was very pragmatic and grounded in her findings i remember her explaining to me scientists have to have the courage to report what they find and even if they dont like what they find they have to report it with the syncrometer in hand she tunneled into a new understanding of the inner working of the human body of course the scientific community stuck up its nose as is its nature and ridiculed dr clark her tools and her theories as well as her clients dr clark was always hard at work when i met with her she cared deeply about her patients but unfortunately she did not always have the help she needed in the clinic it has never been easy to manufacture supplements up to dr clarks standards but we shall continue thanks to her son geoff clark through the years i have had the good fortune to get to know the many people whose lives dr clark touched so magically our customer service team and i have received thousands of calls from people thanking us for dr clarks wonderful lifechanging work i first learned that she had been diagnosed by a doctor to have passed away from arthritis and spinal cord injury a month later on october th her family published a summary of the cause of death multiple myeloma a blood and bone cancer is the most likely cause unfortunately dr clark could not use the same healing tools on herself as she had done on others because of arthritis in her hands for this reason it may have been too late for dr clark to do anything about her own condition finally when she found out about it this must have been a painful and frustrating experience a more detailed account of the cause of her passing is to be found on dr hulda clarks website wwwhuldaclarknet i know that dr clark will continue to touch many more lives in the same way that edgar cayces blessings have outlived his body    dr hulda clark new century press the dr clark books
