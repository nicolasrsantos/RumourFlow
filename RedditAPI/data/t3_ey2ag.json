I know we tolerated each other for many years for the sake of future generations, but sadly, this relationship has clearly run its course. \n\nOur two ideological sides of America cannot and will not ever agree on what is right for us all, so let\u0027s just end it on friendly terms. We can smile and chalk it up to irreconcilable differences and go our own way.\n\nHere is a model separation agreement:\n\n--Our two groups can equitably divide up the country by landmass each taking a similar portion. That will be the difficult part, but I am sure our two sides can come to a friendly agreement. After that, it should be relatively easy! Our respective representatives can effortlessly divide other assets since both sides have such distinct and disparate tastes.\n\n--We don\u0027t like redistributive taxes so you can keep them.\n\n--You are welcome to the liberal judges and the ACLU.\n\n--Since you hate guns and war, we\u0027ll take our firearms, the cops, the NRA and the military.\n\n--We\u0027ll take the nasty, smelly oil industry and you can go with wind, solar and biodiesel.  \n\n--You can keep Oprah, Michael Moore and Rosie O\u0027Donnell. You are, however,  responsible for finding a bio-diesel vehicle big enough to move all three of them.\n\n--We\u0027ll keep capitalism, greedy corporations, pharmaceutical companies, Wal-Mart and Wall Street.\n\n--You can have your beloved lifelong welfare dwellers, food stamps, homeless, homeboys, hippies, druggies and illegal aliens.\n\n--We\u0027ll keep the hot Alaskan hockey moms, greedy CEO\u0027s and rednecks.\n\n--We\u0027ll keep the Bibles and give you NBC and Hollywood . \n\n--You can make nice with Iran and Palestine and we\u0027ll retain the right to invade and hammer places that threaten us.\n\n--You can have the peaceniks and war protesters. When our allies or our way of life are under assault, we\u0027ll help provide them security. \n\n--We\u0027ll keep our Judeo-Christian values.\n\n--You are welcome to Islam, Scientology, Humanism, political correctness and Shirley McClain. You can also have the U.N. but we will no longer be paying the bill. \n\n--We\u0027ll keep the SUV\u0027s, pickup trucks and oversized luxury cars. You can take every Subaru station wagon you can find. \n\n--You can give everyone healthcare if you can find any practicing doctors.\n\n--We\u0027ll continue to believe healthcare is a luxury and not a right. \n\n--We\u0027ll keep \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" and \"The National Anthem.\"\n\n--I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll be happy to substitute \"Imagine\", \"I\u0027d Like to Teach the World to Sing\", \"Kum Ba Ya\" or \"We Are the World\". \n\n--We\u0027ll practice trickle down economics and you can continue to give trickle up poverty your best shot.\n\n--Since it often so offends you, we\u0027ll keep our history, our name and our flag.\n\nWould you agree to this?   If so, please pass it along to other like-minded liberal and conservative patriots and if you do not agree, just hit delete.

And you won\u0027t have to press 1 for English when you call our country.\n\nForward This Every Time You Get It !  Let\u0027s Keep This Going, Maybe Some Of It Will Start Sinking In.\n\nIf you can\u0027t stand behind our Military,  Please feel free to stand in front of them!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Response:\nThis is one of the dumbest things I\u0027ve ever read.  If the moron that wrote that is a Law Student then I\u0027m the pope.\n\nStop sending me this crap Dad.  I voted for Obama and probably will again, especially if the other choice is someone like Sarah Palin.  I personally would rather the government spend our billions helping out Americans with health care and education, rather than spend our billions killing brown people halfway across the globe sending people my age into warzones to secure future business ventures for billionaires.  If that makes me a liberal marxist hippie like whatever redneck moron that actually wrote this thinks it does, I\u0027m ok with that. \n\nThe other son you forwarded this to was recently fired and will be collecting unemployment, partially funded by the federal government.  Is he now a marxist?  A liberal?  A leftist?  What\u0027s worse is he probably laughed and agreed with this if he read it before I responded.  What\u0027s even worse is that those 3 names aren\u0027t any different than saying \"N*gger\" because 99% of the time the people saying them don\u0027t understand what they actually mean but are just interested in being hateful and spiteful and continuing the \"us against them\" mentality when in reality neither Republicans or Democrats have any interest in actually reducing our taxes, just in spending the money differently. \n\nSorry for the long reply, it\u0027s just irritating seeing this type of irrational stupidity over and over and over where I live (the letters to the editor that get printed in the paper here are borderline unbelievable) and then seeing it from people I love and care about.  You\u0027re smarter than the idiots that write this drivel dad, and I know you forward it along because the people you work with send it to you and it sounds funny and you don\u0027t think anything about it, but it hurts me to think that you might actually believe some of the crap in these sorts of forwards.\n\nAnyway, I love you, I\u0027ll call you guys tonight before our game.\n-(my name)\n\n\n\nEDIT:  I\u0027m 30, some of the responses on here sound like they\u0027re from teenagers (I never would have talked to my father like that as a kid) so I wanted to clear that up.  Also, I have a very good relationship with my father.  He\u0027s not perfect and neither am I and we\u0027re both ok with that.  He and my mother are still married, my brother and I live in different parts of the country than they do now, and they are raising my sister\u0027s son (she\u0027s a crackhead mess) and I have utmost respect for them being as good of people as they are.","selftextHTML":"\u0026lt;!-- SC_OFF --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div class\u003d\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;My dad e-mails occasionally, and once in a while he will forward me a forward that he gets.

If the moron that wrote that is a Law Student then I\u0026amp;#39;m the pope.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Stop sending me this crap Dad.  I voted for Obama and probably will again, especially if the other choice is someone like Sarah Palin.  I personally would rather the government spend our billions helping out Americans with health care and education, rather than spend our billions killing brown people halfway across the globe sending people my age into warzones to secure future business ventures for billionaires.  If that makes me a liberal marxist hippie like whatever redneck moron that actually wrote this thinks it does, I\u0026amp;#39;m ok with that. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The other son you forwarded this to was recently fired and will be collecting unemployment, partially funded by the federal government.  Is he now a marxist?  A liberal?  A leftist?  What\u0026amp;#39;s worse is he probably laughed and agreed with this if he read it before I responded.  What\u0026amp;#39;s even worse is that those 3 names aren\u0026amp;#39;t any different than saying \u0026amp;quot;N*gger\u0026amp;quot; because 99% of the time the people saying them don\u0026amp;#39;t understand what they actually mean but are just interested in being hateful and spiteful and continuing the \u0026amp;quot;us against them\u0026amp;quot; mentality when in reality neither Republicans or Democrats have any interest in actually reducing our taxes, just in spending the money differently. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Sorry for the long reply, it\u0026amp;#39;s just irritating seeing this type of irrational stupidity over and over and over where I live (the letters to the editor that get printed in the paper here are borderline unbelievable) and then seeing it from people I love and care about.  You\u0026amp;#39;re smarter than the idiots that write this drivel dad, and I know you forward it along because the people you work with send it to you and it sounds funny and you don\u0026amp;#39;t think anything about it, but it hurts me to think that you might actually believe some of the crap in these sorts of forwards.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Anyway, I love you, I\u0026amp;#39;ll call you guys tonight before our game.\n-(my name)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;EDIT:  I\u0026amp;#39;m 30, some of the responses on here sound like they\u0026amp;#39;re from teenagers (I never would have talked to my father like that as a kid) so I wanted to clear that up.  Also, I have a very good relationship with my father.  He\u0026amp;#39;s not perfect and neither am I and we\u0026amp;#39;re both ok with that.  He and my mother are still married, my brother and I live in different parts of the country than they do now, and they are raising my sister\u0026amp;#39;s son (she\u0026amp;#39;s a crackhead mess) and I have utmost respect for them being as good of people as they are.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;","domain":"self.AskReddit","gilded":0,"commentCount":56,"score":13,"upVotes":13,"downVotes":0,"created":1.294457406E9,"createdUTC":1.294428606E9,"visited":false,"self":false,"saved":false,"edited":true,"stickied":false,"nsfw":false,"hidden":false,"clicked":false,"kind":"t3","identifier":"ey2ag","fullName":"t3_ey2ag"}],"sankeyNodes":[],"sentiments":[]}
