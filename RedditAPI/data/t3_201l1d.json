It has gotten so bad the US threatened to leave NATO since virtually all members are not even making an effort to meet their targets. In a speech in Brussels the US Secretary of Defense said he realizes meeting the targets would be impossible for many NATO members any time soon, but if they consolidated forces to avoid redundancy that would be acceptable too. \n\nSince his speech there have only been more cuts, and no real efforts to integrate or consolidate. Granted Greece will probably not be the deciding factor, but given one less NATO member will now not be meeting its targets, the US could say \"its been 20 years since most members met their obligations, we no longer have any contractual obligations to NATO\" and call it quits.

I honestly hope for the Greek people to do the right thing and get their country back on track and if Germany is at fault for their misery they should do something about it.","duration":"","id":13,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cfz7cx6","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":12,"links":[2],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"ITALIANCOLOGNE","label":"Do you remember the \"Hilfspakete\" that Germany send to Greece a while ago? Most of those packages never left Germany and went straight to the German industry maily Krupp (steal) and HDW Werft Kiel (those guys produced the submarines that Greece bought because of their pseudo-Greek-Turkish arms race)\n\nGermany didn\u0027t enforce changes to the Greek military budget because it would have endangered the bilateral treaties about new vehicles (like I said those were mainly submarines and other ships).  However since you can\u0027t tell the German public that the government is donating billions to the German military sector they hid those sums in those famous care packages. So now our newspapers could write xenophobe bullshit like [this one](http://www.bild.de/politik/wirtschaft/teuer/deal-mit-kieler-hdw-werft-perfekt-11883902.bild.html) and the government had the once-in-a-lifetime possibility to hide donations to the most disgusting industry.    \nYou probably didn\u0027t read about this because it our newspapers blamed it on the ~~je~~...Greek rather than addressing the truth that our country made a lot of money out of those treaties. Stricter regulations would have endangered contracts with German companies which might have led to firing workers. Don\u0027t forget that Greece is one of the few countries that increases its military rather than reducing it like most European countries. Out of all European countries Greece has a very profitable market for German companies.

Granted Greece will probably not be the deciding factor, but given one less NATO member will now not be meeting its targets, the US could say \"its been 20 years since most members met their obligations, we no longer have any contractual obligations to NATO\" and call it quits.

He\u0027s a Greek that lives in London and always relies on second hand information. He writes for the new media started by people who previously worked for \"the establishment\" without any complaints. Many of them were fired. These media are used by the opposition in their propaganda war. This means that when Greece has a problem, this problem is immediately magnified 100x by them, in a pointless point scoring.

More on that below.\n\nGreece belongs to a geographic area receiving a large migratory wave. It is very convenient for some  countries to lecture others when their infrastucture is under a lighter load. Yes, the conditions are not ideal. But most of these people are illegal immigrants. Here it is again: they entered the country illegally, usually via Turkey. Of course, this doesn\u0027t mean they should be denied of their basic human rights. But if a hospital was designed to take care of 60 people and is forced to accept 200 because of the moronic Dublin regulations, this doesn\u0027t mean that Greece should be forced to deal with it alone. You could sit in London, Vienna or Paris and lecture Greece all day, but in the end if your own country was somehow beamed to the South and received a huge number of illegal immigrants, you\u0027d understand that there are no magic solutions. Especially when fiscal discipline is in order.\n\nThe logic of the opposition and these new media (the author just reproduces Unfollow\u0027s story) is this: if there is a problem the government is to blame, because we do not govern. Their platform is based on blatant lies. For example, they managed to convince some desperate poor people that the day following the elections things will instantly become better, other countries will somehow have to forgive over half of Greece\u0027s debt etc. It\u0027s ironic how dozens of opposition MPs declared deposits of hundreds of thousands of Euros and speak of socialism.\n\nThe whole article is filled with half-truths. For example, the current Health Minister studied History and Archaeology. His father died prematurely and from a young age he had to work and save the family publishing house, which was frequently burnt to the ground by pseudo-anarchists friendly to people related to the opposition. He later became famous for selling his books on TV. As for the \"cancers are not urgent\" statement, it is taken out of context. He meant that if you are uninsured and hit by a car, the hospital will treat you in any case. If you are uninsured and have cancer that is not terminal, you\u0027ll have to fill some paperwork and go through a procedure. Speaking of this, it is surprising how many people don\u0027t know that they are eligible to request an \"uninsured\u0027s booklet\" from the local authorities. It allows you to use all public hospitals and pharmacies for free. 100% free. If you are a Greek and know an unemployed person that is not covered by another scheme, please let him or her know about that.\n\nRegarding the conditions in this prison hospital, yes, they are bad. But stating that somehow the government and the employees plot to kill people is idiotic. New hospitals do not appear out of thin air and it doesn\u0027t matter if you are a leftist or a conservative. There are procedures to follow and there are discussions to have, in the Parliament and elsewhere. It will seem bad to say that, but these people are still prisoners. They did something illegal. It\u0027s not easy to let them all go to a regular hospital at once.\n\nAs for Troika matters etc. Only an uninformed person would suggest that Greece is not a sovereign state any more, or that Greece is a hellhole from end to end. As a matter of fact, most places outside Athens haven\u0027t felt the effects of the crisis in the same way as Athens does. This again has to do with most illegal immigrants ending up in Athens, putting a strain on prisons and hospitals that are already filled up. I\u0027m sorry but Greece wasn\u0027t founded to save every single person on the world, it has a duty to take care of Greeks first.\n\nFinally, it is true that the Troika made many bad decisions and Germany\u0027s conservatives played a big role in that. But the taxpayers didn\u0027t paid a single Euro yet. They even made some cash on top and this was stated by other European officials. I remember the Austrian finance minister repeating that last year. The loan agreements don\u0027t work the way you think they are. Nobody takes out Euros from your country to ship them to Greece. States can collectively borrow from the markets at market rates. But they don\u0027t lose cash. ECB is balancing things out behind the scenes, providing their banks with liquidity.

He later became famous for selling his books on TV. As for the \"cancers are not urgent\" statement, it is taken out of context. He meant that if you are uninsured and hit by a car, the hospital will treat you in any case. If you are uninsured and have cancer that is not terminal, you\u0027ll have to fill some paperwork and go through a procedure. Speaking of this, it is surprising how many people don\u0027t know that they are eligible to request an \"uninsured\u0027s booklet\" from the local authorities. It allows you to use all public hospitals and pharmacies for free. 100% free. If you are a Greek and know an unemployed person that is not covered by another scheme, please let him or her know about that.\n\nRegarding the conditions in this prison hospital, yes, they are bad. But stating that somehow the government and the employees plot to kill people is idiotic. New hospitals do not appear out of thin air and it doesn\u0027t matter if you are a leftist or a conservative. There are procedures to follow and there are discussions to have, in the Parliament and elsewhere. It will seem bad to say that, but these people are still prisoners. They did something illegal. It\u0027s not easy to let them all go to a regular hospital at once.\n\nAs for Troika matters etc. Only an uninformed person would suggest that Greece is not a sovereign state any more, or that Greece is a hellhole from end to end. As a matter of fact, most places outside Athens haven\u0027t felt the effects of the crisis in the same way as Athens does. This again has to do with most illegal immigrants ending up in Athens, putting a strain on prisons and hospitals that are already filled up. I\u0027m sorry but Greece wasn\u0027t founded to save every single person on the world, it has a duty to take care of Greeks first.\n\nFinally, it is true that the Troika made many bad decisions and Germany\u0027s conservatives played a big role in that. But the taxpayers didn\u0027t paid a single Euro yet. They even made some cash on top and this was stated by other European officials.

I\u0027m not violating any rules because he is the one disclosing his identity and uses the same username on Reddit, Medium and Twitter. He\u0027s a Greek that lives in London and always relies on second hand information. He writes for the new media started by people who previously worked for \"the establishment\" without any complaints. Many of them were fired. These media are used by the opposition in their propaganda war. This means that when Greece has a problem, this problem is immediately magnified 100x by them, in a pointless point scoring. This time he went too far, he even editorialized his own title to jump into conclusions. But there\u0027s a path between journalistic populism and government or opposition propaganda. More on that below.\n\nGreece belongs to a geographic area receiving a large migratory wave. It is very convenient for some  countries to lecture others when their infrastucture is under a lighter load. Yes, the conditions are not ideal. But most of these people are illegal immigrants. Here it is again: they entered the country illegally, usually via Turkey. Of course, this doesn\u0027t mean they should be denied of their basic human rights. But if a hospital was designed to take care of 60 people and is forced to accept 200 because of the moronic Dublin regulations, this doesn\u0027t mean that Greece should be forced to deal with it alone. You could sit in London, Vienna or Paris and lecture Greece all day, but in the end if your own country was somehow beamed to the South and received a huge number of illegal immigrants, you\u0027d understand that there are no magic solutions. Especially when fiscal discipline is in order.\n\nThe logic of the opposition and these new media (the author just reproduces Unfollow\u0027s story) is this: if there is a problem the government is to blame, because we do not govern. Their platform is based on blatant lies. For example, they managed to convince some desperate poor people that the day following the elections things will instantly become better, other countries will somehow have to forgive over half of Greece\u0027s debt etc. It\u0027s ironic how dozens of opposition MPs declared deposits of hundreds of thousands of Euros and speak of socialism.\n\nThe whole article is filled with half-truths. For example, the current Health Minister studied History and Archaeology. His father died prematurely and from a young age he had to work and save the family publishing house, which was frequently burnt to the ground by pseudo-anarchists friendly to people related to the opposition. He later became famous for selling his books on TV. As for the \"cancers are not urgent\" statement, it is taken out of context. He meant that if you are uninsured and hit by a car, the hospital will treat you in any case. If you are uninsured and have cancer that is not terminal, you\u0027ll have to fill some paperwork and go through a procedure. Speaking of this, it is surprising how many people don\u0027t know that they are eligible to request an \"uninsured\u0027s booklet\" from the local authorities. It allows you to use all public hospitals and pharmacies for free. 100% free. If you are a Greek and know an unemployed person that is not covered by another scheme, please let him or her know about that.\n\nRegarding the conditions in this prison hospital, yes, they are bad. But stating that somehow the government and the employees plot to kill people is idiotic. New hospitals do not appear out of thin air and it doesn\u0027t matter if you are a leftist or a conservative. There are procedures to follow and there are discussions to have, in the Parliament and elsewhere. It will seem bad to say that, but these people are still prisoners. They did something illegal. It\u0027s not easy to let them all go to a regular hospital at once.\n\nAs for Troika matters etc. Only an uninformed person would suggest that Greece is not a sovereign state any more, or that Greece is a hellhole from end to end. As a matter of fact, most places outside Athens haven\u0027t felt the effects of the crisis in the same way as Athens does. This again has to do with most illegal immigrants ending up in Athens, putting a strain on prisons and hospitals that are already filled up. I\u0027m sorry but Greece wasn\u0027t founded to save every single person on the world, it has a duty to take care of Greeks first.\n\nFinally, it is true that the Troika made many bad decisions and Germany\u0027s conservatives played a big role in that. But the taxpayers didn\u0027t paid a single Euro yet. They even made some cash on top and this was stated by other European officials. I remember the Austrian finance minister repeating that last year. The loan agreements don\u0027t work the way you think they are. Nobody takes out Euros from your country to ship them to Greece. States can collectively borrow from the markets at market rates. But they don\u0027t lose cash. ECB is balancing things out behind the scenes, providing their banks with liquidity. At the same time these banks received a lot of deposits from Greece and other crisis-hit countries because depositors were scared they\u0027ll lose all their savings.\n\n**tl;dr bad article, real problems, no magic solutions, no EU country is 100% good or 100% bad**\n","duration":"","id":100,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cfz8hmn","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Cancer and HIV Patients in Greece\u0027s biggest prison are left for dead.","label":"yiannisbab","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_201l1d","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.394485018E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.39451176E9,"simScore":0.7054263820935875,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.394521354E9,"simScore":0.7345344444889804,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.394521354E9,"simScore":0.613626004331906,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.394521674E9,"simScore":0.783396682334252,"sentiment":"  Positive"},"timestamp":1.394522135E9,"simScore":0.5646591169387102,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},{"index":110,"links":[106],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"YiannisBab","label":"You know who makes clear profit out of it because they borrow money with negative interest?

Provide some proper market stability that way and the EU won\u0027t get proper full public approval overnight but will have to prove itself by not just by handling struggling parts of southern Europe as some by loans contained problem but as a problem of their own.\n\nYou don\u0027t roll with a single common currency with nothing to back it up and expect it to work due to ignorance or being afraid of public anti federal backlash simply to receive it anyway when that currency passes its first proper hurdle and runs right into it.","duration":"","id":120,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cfzghxk","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":116,"links":[113],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"urquan","label":"\u0026gt; You seem to forget that said countries individually would have long since let Greece drop\n\nYou seem to imply that Greece was held up somehow by these countries, but it far from the case, it was milked of the remaining money.

I\u0027m not violating any rules because he is the one disclosing his identity and uses the same username on Reddit, Medium and Twitter. He\u0027s a Greek that lives in London and always relies on second hand information. He writes for the new media started by people who previously worked for \"the establishment\" without any complaints. Many of them were fired. These media are used by the opposition in their propaganda war. This means that when Greece has a problem, this problem is immediately magnified 100x by them, in a pointless point scoring. This time he went too far, he even editorialized his own title to jump into conclusions. But there\u0027s a path between journalistic populism and government or opposition propaganda. More on that below.\n\nGreece belongs to a geographic area receiving a large migratory wave. It is very convenient for some  countries to lecture others when their infrastucture is under a lighter load. Yes, the conditions are not ideal. But most of these people are illegal immigrants. Here it is again: they entered the country illegally, usually via Turkey. Of course, this doesn\u0027t mean they should be denied of their basic human rights. But if a hospital was designed to take care of 60 people and is forced to accept 200 because of the moronic Dublin regulations, this doesn\u0027t mean that Greece should be forced to deal with it alone. You could sit in London, Vienna or Paris and lecture Greece all day, but in the end if your own country was somehow beamed to the South and received a huge number of illegal immigrants, you\u0027d understand that there are no magic solutions. Especially when fiscal discipline is in order.\n\nThe logic of the opposition and these new media (the author just reproduces Unfollow\u0027s story) is this: if there is a problem the government is to blame, because we do not govern. Their platform is based on blatant lies. For example, they managed to convince some desperate poor people that the day following the elections things will instantly become better, other countries will somehow have to forgive over half of Greece\u0027s debt etc. It\u0027s ironic how dozens of opposition MPs declared deposits of hundreds of thousands of Euros and speak of socialism.\n\nThe whole article is filled with half-truths. For example, the current Health Minister studied History and Archaeology. His father died prematurely and from a young age he had to work and save the family publishing house, which was frequently burnt to the ground by pseudo-anarchists friendly to people related to the opposition. He later became famous for selling his books on TV. As for the \"cancers are not urgent\" statement, it is taken out of context. He meant that if you are uninsured and hit by a car, the hospital will treat you in any case. If you are uninsured and have cancer that is not terminal, you\u0027ll have to fill some paperwork and go through a procedure. Speaking of this, it is surprising how many people don\u0027t know that they are eligible to request an \"uninsured\u0027s booklet\" from the local authorities. It allows you to use all public hospitals and pharmacies for free. 100% free. If you are a Greek and know an unemployed person that is not covered by another scheme, please let him or her know about that.\n\nRegarding the conditions in this prison hospital, yes, they are bad. But stating that somehow the government and the employees plot to kill people is idiotic. New hospitals do not appear out of thin air and it doesn\u0027t matter if you are a leftist or a conservative. There are procedures to follow and there are discussions to have, in the Parliament and elsewhere. It will seem bad to say that, but these people are still prisoners. They did something illegal. It\u0027s not easy to let them all go to a regular hospital at once.\n\nAs for Troika matters etc. Only an uninformed person would suggest that Greece is not a sovereign state any more, or that Greece is a hellhole from end to end. As a matter of fact, most places outside Athens haven\u0027t felt the effects of the crisis in the same way as Athens does. This again has to do with most illegal immigrants ending up in Athens, putting a strain on prisons and hospitals that are already filled up. I\u0027m sorry but Greece wasn\u0027t founded to save every single person on the world, it has a duty to take care of Greeks first.\n\nFinally, it is true that the Troika made many bad decisions and Germany\u0027s conservatives played a big role in that. But the taxpayers didn\u0027t paid a single Euro yet. They even made some cash on top and this was stated by other European officials. I remember the Austrian finance minister repeating that last year. The loan agreements don\u0027t work the way you think they are. Nobody takes out Euros from your country to ship them to Greece. States can collectively borrow from the markets at market rates. But they don\u0027t lose cash. ECB is balancing things out behind the scenes, providing their banks with liquidity.

He later became famous for selling his books on TV. As for the \"cancers are not urgent\" statement, it is taken out of context. He meant that if you are uninsured and hit by a car, the hospital will treat you in any case. If you are uninsured and have cancer that is not terminal, you\u0027ll have to fill some paperwork and go through a procedure. Speaking of this, it is surprising how many people don\u0027t know that they are eligible to request an \"uninsured\u0027s booklet\" from the local authorities. It allows you to use all public hospitals and pharmacies for free. 100% free. If you are a Greek and know an unemployed person that is not covered by another scheme, please let him or her know about that.\n\nRegarding the conditions in this prison hospital, yes, they are bad. But stating that somehow the government and the employees plot to kill people is idiotic. New hospitals do not appear out of thin air and it doesn\u0027t matter if you are a leftist or a conservative. There are procedures to follow and there are discussions to have, in the Parliament and elsewhere. It will seem bad to say that, but these people are still prisoners. They did something illegal. It\u0027s not easy to let them all go to a regular hospital at once.\n\nAs for Troika matters etc. Only an uninformed person would suggest that Greece is not a sovereign state any more, or that Greece is a hellhole from end to end.

This again has to do with most illegal immigrants ending up in Athens, putting a strain on prisons and hospitals that are already filled up. I\u0027m sorry but Greece wasn\u0027t founded to save every single person on the world, it has a duty to take care of Greeks first.\n\nFinally, it is true that the Troika made many bad decisions and Germany\u0027s conservatives played a big role in that.

I\u0027m not violating any rules because he is the one disclosing his identity and uses the same username on Reddit, Medium and Twitter. He\u0027s a Greek that lives in London and always relies on second hand information. He writes for the new media started by people who previously worked for \"the establishment\" without any complaints. Many of them were fired. These media are used by the opposition in their propaganda war. This means that when Greece has a problem, this problem is immediately magnified 100x by them, in a pointless point scoring. This time he went too far, he even editorialized his own title to jump into conclusions. But there\u0027s a path between journalistic populism and government or opposition propaganda. More on that below.\n\nGreece belongs to a geographic area receiving a large migratory wave. It is very convenient for some  countries to lecture others when their infrastucture is under a lighter load. Yes, the conditions are not ideal. But most of these people are illegal immigrants. Here it is again: they entered the country illegally, usually via Turkey. Of course, this doesn\u0027t mean they should be denied of their basic human rights. But if a hospital was designed to take care of 60 people and is forced to accept 200 because of the moronic Dublin regulations, this doesn\u0027t mean that Greece should be forced to deal with it alone. You could sit in London, Vienna or Paris and lecture Greece all day, but in the end if your own country was somehow beamed to the South and received a huge number of illegal immigrants, you\u0027d understand that there are no magic solutions. Especially when fiscal discipline is in order.\n\nThe logic of the opposition and these new media (the author just reproduces Unfollow\u0027s story) is this: if there is a problem the government is to blame, because we do not govern. Their platform is based on blatant lies. For example, they managed to convince some desperate poor people that the day following the elections things will instantly become better, other countries will somehow have to forgive over half of Greece\u0027s debt etc. It\u0027s ironic how dozens of opposition MPs declared deposits of hundreds of thousands of Euros and speak of socialism.\n\nThe whole article is filled with half-truths. For example, the current Health Minister studied History and Archaeology. His father died prematurely and from a young age he had to work and save the family publishing house, which was frequently burnt to the ground by pseudo-anarchists friendly to people related to the opposition. He later became famous for selling his books on TV. As for the \"cancers are not urgent\" statement, it is taken out of context. He meant that if you are uninsured and hit by a car, the hospital will treat you in any case. If you are uninsured and have cancer that is not terminal, you\u0027ll have to fill some paperwork and go through a procedure. Speaking of this, it is surprising how many people don\u0027t know that they are eligible to request an \"uninsured\u0027s booklet\" from the local authorities. It allows you to use all public hospitals and pharmacies for free. 100% free. If you are a Greek and know an unemployed person that is not covered by another scheme, please let him or her know about that.\n\nRegarding the conditions in this prison hospital, yes, they are bad. But stating that somehow the government and the employees plot to kill people is idiotic. New hospitals do not appear out of thin air and it doesn\u0027t matter if you are a leftist or a conservative. There are procedures to follow and there are discussions to have, in the Parliament and elsewhere. It will seem bad to say that, but these people are still prisoners. They did something illegal. It\u0027s not easy to let them all go to a regular hospital at once.\n\nAs for Troika matters etc. Only an uninformed person would suggest that Greece is not a sovereign state any more, or that Greece is a hellhole from end to end. As a matter of fact, most places outside Athens haven\u0027t felt the effects of the crisis in the same way as Athens does. This again has to do with most illegal immigrants ending up in Athens, putting a strain on prisons and hospitals that are already filled up. I\u0027m sorry but Greece wasn\u0027t founded to save every single person on the world, it has a duty to take care of Greeks first.\n\nFinally, it is true that the Troika made many bad decisions and Germany\u0027s conservatives played a big role in that. But the taxpayers didn\u0027t paid a single Euro yet. They even made some cash on top and this was stated by other European officials. I remember the Austrian finance minister repeating that last year. The loan agreements don\u0027t work the way you think they are. Nobody takes out Euros from your country to ship them to Greece. States can collectively borrow from the markets at market rates. But they don\u0027t lose cash. ECB is balancing things out behind the scenes, providing their banks with liquidity. At the same time these banks received a lot of deposits from Greece and other crisis-hit countries because depositors were scared they\u0027ll lose all their savings.\n\n**tl;dr bad article, real problems, no magic solutions, no EU country is 100% good or 100% bad**\n","duration":"","id":134,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cfz8hmn","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":8,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Cancer and HIV Patients in Greece\u0027s biggest prison are left for dead.","label":"yiannisbab","duration":"","id":8,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_201l1d","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.394485018E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.39451176E9,"simScore":0.7054263820935875,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.394521354E9,"simScore":0.7345344444889804,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.394521354E9,"simScore":0.613626004331906,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.394521674E9,"simScore":0.783396682334252,"sentiment":"  Positive"},"timestamp":1.394522135E9,"simScore":0.5646591169387102,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},{"index":140,"links":[8],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"urquan","label":"People responsible for this (edit: I\u0027m talking about the general state of healthcare in Greece) are the troika.

Provide some proper market stability that way and the EU won\u0027t get proper full public approval overnight but will have to prove itself by not just by handling struggling parts of southern Europe as some by loans contained problem but as a problem of their own.\n\nYou don\u0027t roll with a single common currency with nothing to back it up and expect it to work due to ignorance or being afraid of public anti federal backlash simply to receive it anyway when that currency passes its first proper hurdle and runs right into it.","duration":"","id":143,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cfzghxk","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":142,"links":[141],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"urquan","label":"\u0026gt; You seem to forget that said countries individually would have long since let Greece drop\n\nYou seem to imply that Greece was held up somehow by these countries, but it far from the case, it was milked of the remaining money.
