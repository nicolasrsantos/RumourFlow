Over the course of the last 5 years, from his unlikely nomination to his win of the Democratic Primary, through his 4 years in office, to the day he won his 2nd term in office, /r/Obama has kept the faith with the President\u0027s supporters. \n\nLets look at some of the amazing things Obama has done in office.\n\n[Pursued American Interests around the globe while improving the countries image](http://i.imgur.com/mSdpe.gif)\n\n[Kept the middle east in line](http://i.imgur.com/fVyyB.gif)\n\n[Enacted many important pieces of Legislation](http://i.imgur.com/VTP8O.gif)\n\nAnd, most importantly, [kept a sober, responsible watch](http://i.imgur.com/7ZnTx.gif) over the citizens whom he was elected by.\n\nSo I decided to speak with the moderators [to give a hand](http://i.imgur.com/el7GE.gif) to those behind the scenes in this subreddit\n\n\u0026gt; What involvement have you had in the campaign?\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;**krispykrackers:** I had more involvement in the 2008 election, when I joined the Democratic movement in my county. I didn\u0027t do a lot, mostly drove around and put flyers on self-identified democrat\u0027s doors about where and when to vote. This year I worked really hard on trying to educate my closest family members who still believe Obama is a muslim born in Africa.\n\n\u0026gt; How do you feel about Obama winning his second term? What should his priorities be for the next 4 years?\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;**krispykrackers:** Relieved. He needs to focus on rebuilding the economy, maintaining foreign relations, maintaining Obamacare, and this is a personal obsession of mine, but hopefully we can all, as a globalized effort, do something about North Korea.\n\n\u0026gt; What is your favorite submission to /r/obama?\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;**krispykrackers:** The one where Obama wins.
