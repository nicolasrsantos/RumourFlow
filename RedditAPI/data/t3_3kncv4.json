They are paranoid about this because they report to the Swiss, the only one who have any sort of leverage over FIFA.

We\u0027ll be paying 10 times more for our TV channels and there would be ads all over the place. \n\nAs the OP mentions, the price is small to generate revenue for all concerned. FIFA is already making Billions. But if FA\u0027s, business, etc can in the meantime generate revenue its all good, that is as long as people like Warner allow the system to work.

After all its at this stage the main corruption takes place and is one of the points where the current US investigation has nabbed the CONCACAF mess and the Copa 2016 issue as well.  \n\nIts not simple, its very complex. And on top given that FIFA was seeing double digit growth this whole time, it would be down right insane if it would be selling these for 20 times the value as that Jaimie Fuller guy suggests.  \n\nFIFA can not be making $40 BILLION every 4 years for 1 WC. That is mental. \n\n\u0026gt; If it was only a 10% profit, one could argue that the middleman is not receiving much of a favor, but rather providing a service. However, if the middleman resells the asset for 20x what it pays for, then it is pretty clear that it is a favor. \n\nIts not so clear. \n\nIf every co-conspirator is getting the same amount just not near Millions, its still fucked up shit and horse trading and favor exchanging. The 18-20 million was an example not literal.  \n\nCorruption is corruption, there is no little corruption or big corruption. \n\n\u0026gt; But individuals at FIFA only sell things cheap if there is some personal gain to them\n\nThey sell expensive as well, ask Europe and North American and Asian markets. And even there they not only expect but get favors. \nPrice is not relevant, problem is elsewhere.  \n\nFA\u0027s are the problem because they have always resisted reform. That is how its been. FIFA is not an isolate. Its existence is what its made of. You can\u0027t change corruption-dynamic from a top-down approach in a linked system, this is logically not possible. \n\nIt is the FA\u0027s which dictate what FIFA can and can not do. When the 2011 FIFA Congress happened the smaller reform that took place were because the majority of FA\u0027s were in favor of them. \n\nWhen more major reforms are going to take place next year its because these FA\u0027s are letting it happen. \n\nMostly because power block like the CFU has been broken up completely.  \n\nAlso open bidding is sure a nice option, i have nothing against that as well.  \n\nBut its not a option here because FIFA wasn\u0027t selling to broadcasters directly, they were giving it to another footballing block. FIFA when selling to broadcasters usually does indeed sell it for higher value.  \n\nThis is not even that surprising, CFU is part of the global football system, its like Federal grants being more liberally given internally in a Govt/State. CFU is not broadcasters itself.  \n\nAdditionally because Warner controlled those 23+ FA\u0027s its not just as easy as saying, Fuck you Warner, get out of here. It just doesn\u0027t work like that.  \n\nThis is why FIFA and IOC can\u0027t be broken from the outside, it can only be changed from the inside. It is too powerful and self sufficient and a monopoly over a product which has no expiry date for decades.  \n\nThey hold all the cards. \n\nEVEN a new-FIFA, the silly idea that some people hold, would not change things because this new-FIFA will still have the same grass root corruption problem because the members will be from FA\u0027s which are susceptible to corruption. Laws can\u0027t keep up with the sort of corruption that FIFA does, they learned from the best(IOC) and perfected this.\n","duration":"","id":73,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_cuz1ywa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":72,"links":[71],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"blue_whaoo","label":"\u0026gt; This is from 2005.

And when people like Warner have control of 30 FA\u0027s, any President\u0027s position is only as good as him maintaining the status quo, suggesting he get lost is the sort of naive ignorance i was talking about.  \n\nFIFA will reform in its own time and in the meanwhile the point was, the content of this post were not relevant, esp to FIFA or Blatter. As other comments have said, it just shows how fucked up Warner was and Warner didn\u0027t exist because of Blatter, he had his own independent base, which only just got dismantled in the last 2-3 years, not in 2005 when these events took place.

Although the first time a document is on the table, which shows that Blatter himself was involved in a questionable deal.\n\nUpdate - This is, in fact, old news from September 2011:\n\n\u0026gt; ***FIFA ends Warner TV deal***\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt; FIFA has terminated a multi-million pound 2014 World Cup TV deal after discovering the rights had been sub-licensed to a company owned by controversial former vice-president Jack Warner. \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; The agreement with the Caribbean Football Union (CFU) has been brought to an end after FIFA told the organisation it had not approved the sub-licensing deal with Warner\u0027s company, JD International (JDI). \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; Warner, who was at that time also the CFU president, sold the rights to Jamaica-based cable provider SportsMax in 2007 for a fee reported to be between US$18 million and US$20 million, though that included the 2010 World Cup as well. \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; FIFA was also owed several payments dating back to 2009 for the rights, which covered 29 Caribbean countries. \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; Warner resigned from all football activities in June, a month after being charged with bribery by FIFA, which then dropped its investigation saying it no longer had jurisdiction over the Trinidadian. \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; FIFA has sent a letter to the CFU saying they have \"only recently become aware\" of the sub-licensing agreement, as well as detailing the missed payments, and terminating the contract. \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; Warner has claimed that FIFA\u0027s action is \"designed to go after me\" and that he was shocked that the CFU had been targeted. \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; FIFA said in a statement to the British Press Association: \"The CFU was a media rights licensee for FIFA events in selected territories in the Caribbean. \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; \"However, CFU is no longer a media rights licensee of FIFA. FIFA has secured good coverage in the region directly, but has still not finalised any announcement.\" \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; Conservative MP Damian Collins, who is campaigning for FIFA reforms, said Warner\u0027s involvement pointed to a clear conflict of interest. \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; The initial contract with the CFU was agreed in 2005 giving the organisation the rights for the 2010 and 2014 World Cups for countries in the Caribbean. \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; The CFU, headed by Warner, sub-licensed the rights to his company JDI. In 2007, JDI sold on those rights to SportsMax. \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; FIFA has said it had not approved the sub-licensing and had only become aware of it recently, but there was no secrecy about Warner\u0027s involvement. \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; Indeed he held a photo opportunity with SportsMax executives to announce the deal, and according to SportsMax\u0027s own website, the deal was worth between US$18-20 million. \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; The website said Warner \"negotiated the deal on behalf of JDI\" and \"in his capacity as president of the CFU\". \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; Collins, who sits on the culture, media and sport committee, said the reforms to be announced by FIFA president Sepp Blatter needed to address conflicts of interest. \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; He said: \"There should be a very strict code where members of FIFA\u0027s executive committee have to declare all their financial interests. \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; \"If it looks like senior officials are making money on the side as a result of their role in football, that is plainly wrong. \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; \"For someone who has responsibility for the game of football to be making money out of the exploitation of that game cannot be right.\" \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; Warner\u0027s close connections to the television rights in the Caribbean were also revealed by former FA chairman Lord Triesman in his claims about improper approaches during England\u0027s 2018 World Cup bid—Triesman said Warner asked for US$500,000 to be channelled through him to buy the television rights to show the 2010 World Cup on big screens in earthquake-hit Haiti. \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; Warner said FIFA\u0027s action against the CFU was a publicity stunt. \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; He told the Press Association: \"Such ignoble pursuit has nothing to do with the cleansing of corruption within the FIFA but rather to offer the perception of an aura of cleansing within the FIFA. \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; \"The matter is designed to go after me...and is now with the CFU\u0027s Swiss lawyers.\" \n\nSourced from: http://www.trinidadexpress.com/sports/FIFA_ends_Warner_TV_deal-129507108.html\n\n","selftextHTML":"\u0026lt;!-- SC_OFF --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div class\u003d\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://www.srf.ch/news/allgemeines/blatter-verkaufte-tv-rechte-weit-unter-dem-marktpreis\"\u0026gt;http://www.srf.ch/news/allgemeines/blatter-verkaufte-tv-rechte-weit-unter-dem-marktpreis\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://s2.srfcdn.ch/images/auftritte/news/bilder/2015/09/11/node_8015854/96172144-2-ger-DE/bild_s8.jpg\"\u0026gt;http://s2.srfcdn.ch/images/auftritte/news/bilder/2015/09/11/node_8015854/96172144-2-ger-DE/bild_s8.jpg\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://s1.srfcdn.ch/images/auftritte/news/bilder/2015/09/11/node_8015754/96171024-2-ger-DE/bild_s8.jpg\"\u0026gt;http://s1.srfcdn.ch/images/auftritte/news/bilder/2015/09/11/node_8015754/96171024-2-ger-DE/bild_s8.jpg\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://s2.srfcdn.ch/images/auftritte/news/bilder/2015/09/11/node_8015764/96171059-2-ger-DE/bild_s8.jpg\"\u0026gt;http://s2.srfcdn.ch/images/auftritte/news/bilder/2015/09/11/node_8015764/96171059-2-ger-DE/bild_s8.jpg\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://s1.srfcdn.ch/images/auftritte/news/bilder/2015/09/11/node_8015829/96171284-2-ger-DE/bild_s8.jpg\"\u0026gt;http://s1.srfcdn.ch/images/auftritte/news/bilder/2015/09/11/node_8015829/96171284-2-ger-DE/bild_s8.jpg\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The document, \u0026amp;quot;10vor10\u0026amp;quot; exclusively present, shows for the first time, as Fifa boss Sepp Blatter has been involved in a questionable deal.
