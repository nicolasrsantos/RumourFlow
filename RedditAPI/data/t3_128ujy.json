However, it has supplied arms to other countries, for example Sri Lanka, Bahrain, Egypt and Yemen, where there is a substantial risk that they could be used to commit of facilitate serious human rights violations. \n\n\u0026gt;**Irresponsible transfers:** \nAs the main arms supplier to Egypt, the US authorized the sale of small arms, millions of rounds of ammunition and chemical agents for riot control, despite the security forces’ violent crackdown on protesters. Yemen was also supplied with small arms, chemical agents and armoured vehicles, and Bahrain with small arms. It provides Colombia’s security forces with arms, military aid and training, despite their persistent violations of human rights. \n\n\u0026gt;**Stance on the ATT:** \nSince October 2009, when the Obama administration reversed previous opposition to an ATT, US support has been crucial in getting to the current negotiation stage. The US has said it wants the treaty to raise the international standard for export control of armaments as close as possible to that of the US. **However, the US position is weaker on human rights protection in the treaty than many of its allies.** For example, **US officials have not wanted to include obligations on states to prohibit transfers of arms even where there is credible evidence of their potential use for serious violations of human rights.** US officials have also argued against including ammunition under the scope of the treaty, claiming it is too sensitive and would pose technical problems of implementation. Overall, US officials would prefer a short loose document that spells out general principles to “take into account” rather than strong binding measures.\n\nhttp://www.amnesty.org/en/news/big-six-arms-exporters-2012-06-11","duration":"","id":345,"color":"black","redditID":"t1_c6taaif","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":344,"links":[341],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"MisterFriday","label":"That\u0027s not true.

Mine is actually your argument. When someone says \"Obama tried to close Guantanamo.\" Big /r/politics talking point.\n\nGlenn Greenwald has been harping on this one, because it is really just a leftist misinformation when you actually look at the details. I\u0027ll cite a couple of articles from him.\n\nThis is from back in July, when[ the administration imposed harsher rules](http://www.salon.com/2012/07/23/the_obama_gitmo_myth/) for prisoners in Guantanamo:\n\n\u0026gt;The New York Times Editorial Page today denounced these new rules as “spiteful,” cited it as “the Obama administration’s latest overuse of executive authority,” and said “the administration looks as if it is imperiously punishing detainees for their temerity in bringing legal challenges to their detention and losing.” Detainee lawyers are refusing to submit to these new rules and are asking a federal court to rule that they violate the detainees’ right to legal counsel.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;But every time the issue of ongoing injustices at Guantanamo is raised, one hears the same apologia from the President’s defenders: the President wanted and tried to end all of this, but Congress — including even liberals such as Russ Feingold and Bernie Sanders — overwhelming voted to deny him the funds to close Guantanamo. While those claims, standing alone, are true, they omit crucial facts and thus paint a wildly misleading picture about what Obama actually did and did not seek to do.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;What made Guantanamo controversial was not its physical location: that it was located in the Caribbean Sea rather than on American soil (that’s especially true since the Supreme Court ruled in 2004 that U.S. courts have jurisdiction over the camp). What made Guantanamo such a travesty — and what still makes it such — is that it is a system of indefinite detention whereby human beings are put in cages for years and years without ever being charged with a crime. President Obama’s so-called “plan to close Guantanamo” — even if it had been approved in full by Congress — did not seek to end that core injustice. It sought to do the opposite: Obama’s plan would have continued the system of indefinite detention, but simply re-located it from Guantanamo Bay onto American soil.\n\n\nThis other one is from last month, when a[ prisoner was found dead](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/11/guantanamo-prisoner-death-democrats) in his cell. \n\n\u0026gt;That\u0027s because Obama\u0027s plan was not so much to \"close Gitmo\" as it was simply to relocate it a few thousand miles north onto US soil, with its system of indefinite detention – which makes the camp so odious – fully preserved. That is why civil liberties groups such as the ACLU harshly denounced Obama\u0027s plan as \"Gitmo North\". As the ACLU explained, long before Congress obstructed what Obama wanted to do, \"the administration plans to continue its predecessor\u0027s policy of indefinite detention without charge or trial for some detainees, with only a change of location.\"\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;Indeed, as I documented several months ago, the system of indefinite detention from the start has been central to Obama\u0027s plan for these detainees. Put another way, even if Congress had given Obama everything he wanted, the system that means that death is the only way out for many detainees would have been fully preserved. The excuse-making for Obama – \"oh, he tried to close the camp but Congress would not let him\" – is simply a deceitful tactic Democrats have concocted to justify their total silence about a grave injustice they once pretended to find so appalling and their raucous swooning for a president who supports it.\n\nIn that last article there\u0027s a great quote from Bush\u0027s former NSA and CIA director, General Michael Hayden, proving what should be the most ignored detail from partisan liberals.\n\n\u0026gt;\"President Barack Obama has closely followed the policy of his predecessor, President George W Bush, when it comes to tactics used in the \u0027war on terror\u0027 – from rendition, targeted killings, state secrets, Guantánamo Bay to domestic spying, according to Michael Hayden, Bush\u0027s former director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;\"\u0027But let me repeat my hypothesis: Despite the frequent drama at the political level, America and Americans have found a comfortable center line in what it is they want their government to do and what it is they accept their government doing. It is that practical consensus that has fostered such powerful continuity between two vastly different presidents, George W Bush and Barack Obama, when it comes, when it comes to this conflict,\u0027 Hayden said Friday while speaking at the University of Michigan …\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;\"\u0027And so, we\u0027ve seen all of these continuities between two very different human beings, President Bush and President Obama. We are at war, targeted killings have continued; in fact, if you look at the statistics, targeted killings have increased under Obama.\u0027\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;\"He said that was the case because, in one differing path between the two presidents, Obama in 2009 closed CIA \u0027black sites\u0027 and ratcheted down on torturing detainees. But instead of capturing so-called \u0027enemy combatants\u0027, President Obama kills them instead, Hayden said.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;\"\u0027We have made it so politically dangerous and so legally difficult that we don\u0027t capture anyone anymore,\u0027 Hayden said. \u0027We take another option, we kill them.

Mine is actually your argument. When someone says \"Obama tried to close Guantanamo.\" Big /r/politics talking point.\n\nGlenn Greenwald has been harping on this one, because it is really just a leftist misinformation when you actually look at the details. I\u0027ll cite a couple of articles from him.\n\nThis is from back in July, when[ the administration imposed harsher rules](http://www.salon.com/2012/07/23/the_obama_gitmo_myth/) for prisoners in Guantanamo:\n\n\u0026gt;The New York Times Editorial Page today denounced these new rules as “spiteful,” cited it as “the Obama administration’s latest overuse of executive authority,” and said “the administration looks as if it is imperiously punishing detainees for their temerity in bringing legal challenges to their detention and losing.” Detainee lawyers are refusing to submit to these new rules and are asking a federal court to rule that they violate the detainees’ right to legal counsel.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;But every time the issue of ongoing injustices at Guantanamo is raised, one hears the same apologia from the President’s defenders: the President wanted and tried to end all of this, but Congress — including even liberals such as Russ Feingold and Bernie Sanders — overwhelming voted to deny him the funds to close Guantanamo. While those claims, standing alone, are true, they omit crucial facts and thus paint a wildly misleading picture about what Obama actually did and did not seek to do.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;What made Guantanamo controversial was not its physical location: that it was located in the Caribbean Sea rather than on American soil (that’s especially true since the Supreme Court ruled in 2004 that U.S. courts have jurisdiction over the camp). What made Guantanamo such a travesty — and what still makes it such — is that it is a system of indefinite detention whereby human beings are put in cages for years and years without ever being charged with a crime. President Obama’s so-called “plan to close Guantanamo” — even if it had been approved in full by Congress — did not seek to end that core injustice. It sought to do the opposite: Obama’s plan would have continued the system of indefinite detention, but simply re-located it from Guantanamo Bay onto American soil.\n\n\nThis other one is from last month, when a[ prisoner was found dead](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/11/guantanamo-prisoner-death-democrats) in his cell. \n\n\u0026gt;That\u0027s because Obama\u0027s plan was not so much to \"close Gitmo\" as it was simply to relocate it a few thousand miles north onto US soil, with its system of indefinite detention – which makes the camp so odious – fully preserved. That is why civil liberties groups such as the ACLU harshly denounced Obama\u0027s plan as \"Gitmo North\". As the ACLU explained, long before Congress obstructed what Obama wanted to do, \"the administration plans to continue its predecessor\u0027s policy of indefinite detention without charge or trial for some detainees, with only a change of location.\"\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;Indeed, as I documented several months ago, the system of indefinite detention from the start has been central to Obama\u0027s plan for these detainees. Put another way, even if Congress had given Obama everything he wanted, the system that means that death is the only way out for many detainees would have been fully preserved. The excuse-making for Obama – \"oh, he tried to close the camp but Congress would not let him\" – is simply a deceitful tactic Democrats have concocted to justify their total silence about a grave injustice they once pretended to find so appalling and their raucous swooning for a president who supports it.\n\nIn that last article there\u0027s a great quote from Bush\u0027s former NSA and CIA director, General Michael Hayden, proving what should be the most ignored detail from partisan liberals.\n\n\u0026gt;\"President Barack Obama has closely followed the policy of his predecessor, President George W Bush, when it comes to tactics used in the \u0027war on terror\u0027 – from rendition, targeted killings, state secrets, Guantánamo Bay to domestic spying, according to Michael Hayden, Bush\u0027s former director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;\"\u0027But let me repeat my hypothesis: Despite the frequent drama at the political level, America and Americans have found a comfortable center line in what it is they want their government to do and what it is they accept their government doing. It is that practical consensus that has fostered such powerful continuity between two vastly different presidents, George W Bush and Barack Obama, when it comes, when it comes to this conflict,\u0027 Hayden said Friday while speaking at the University of Michigan …\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;\"\u0027And so, we\u0027ve seen all of these continuities between two very different human beings, President Bush and President Obama. We are at war, targeted killings have continued; in fact, if you look at the statistics, targeted killings have increased under Obama.\u0027\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;\"He said that was the case because, in one differing path between the two presidents, Obama in 2009 closed CIA \u0027black sites\u0027 and ratcheted down on torturing detainees. But instead of capturing so-called \u0027enemy combatants\u0027, President Obama kills them instead, Hayden said.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;\"\u0027We have made it so politically dangerous and so legally difficult that we don\u0027t capture anyone anymore,\u0027 Hayden said. \u0027We take another option, we kill them. Now. I don\u0027t morally oppose that\u0027\".

Upvotes for you, most definitely.\n\nEDIT2: Just in case anyone is wondering, I currently own and am very proficient with the following:\n\n* 1 .357 handgun, long-barrel\n\n* 2 30.06 deer rifles, bolt-action, scoped\n\n* 1 32.30, lever-action\n\n* 1 12 gauge shotgun, break action\n\n* 1 20 gauge shotgun, break action\n\nI also owned 4-10 shotguns in single and double barrel and a .22 rifle, but they were stolen while I was in college.\n\nSo, I\u0027m not against guns in general. I just 1) am against military-grade guns being legal, 2) don\u0027t think the 2nd Amendment is actually a valid defense of gun-ownership in the 21st century. I would say that gun-ownership is an implied right that is not guaranteed.","duration":"","id":472,"color":"black","redditID":"t1_c6ththu","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":471,"links":[470],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"brianisdead","label":"The Aurora shooting is actually a very good example of why a larger magazine is not as effective as having multiple average sized magazines.  Holmes opened fire with this AR-15 loaded with a 100-round drum magazine; it malfunctioned after less than 30 rounds, which is the typical capacity of a normal magazine.  If he had instead carried three or four 30 round magazines, he could have easily cleared his weapon and reloaded in under 5 seconds and continued firing rather than having to switch to his glock.\n\nIn your hypothetical scenario, no he wouldn\u0027t have killed/injured as many people.  But this is kind of besides the point since even under the old AWB he would have access to pretty much the exact same load out he actually did use.  If you are using the example to advocate an even more extreme AWB, well, that\u0027s a whole new can of worms.\n\nI think the fact is that crazy people are going to go crazy, even if guns were completely outlawed he could have tossed a home made explosive in the theater and probably gotten even more casualties.\n\nIt just comes down to what you fundamentally believe.  I didn\u0027t support the Patriot Act in reaction to 9/11, and I don\u0027t support assault weapon bans in reaction to shootings.

Aside from the shotgun, the other weapons the Aurora shooter used were both high capacity weapons.\n\nAnd a .223 round can easily pierce armor. It\u0027s more about the grain than the caliber, which in the case of AR-15 is going to be pretty high most of the time (though not always). The reason that .223 rifles are sometimes banned for hunting is because they go through the animal without causing immediately lethal damage, causing the animal to then flee and possibly go off and die without being used by the hunter. This is a pretty different situation from a mass shooting spree.\n\nLet\u0027s be hypothetical. In the case of the Aurora shooting, what if the shooter had had a shotgun, a bolt-action 30.06 with a 6 round clip, and a .357 with a 6 round clip. Would he have been as deadly as he was in real life? I don\u0027t know...maybe, but it seems unlikely to me.

They are generally only rated to stop smaller calibers.  Infact, the AR-15 typically is chambered in .223, which is less powerful than most rounds used for hunting; it is actually illegal to hunt with .223 in a lot of places because it isn\u0027t effective in killing game animals.  \n\nThe fact is, firearms classified as \"assault weapons\" are generally NOT more dangerous than most other guns.  Take the Aurora shooting for example, he used an AR-15, a shotgun, and a glock.  All three of these weapons have AWB-friendly versions.  The only difference would have been the ergonomics on the AR, potentially 3 less rounds in the shotgun, and the glock would have been the same.  All three of these weapons are also insanely popular with law abiding citizens.  The Tuscon shooter also used a AWB-legal weapon, the glock 19.\n\nNow there is an argument against large capacity magazines, because really who the fuck needs 50+ rounds?  But honestly it doesn\u0027t really make the weapon more effective.  The larger magazines always have a problem with proper feeding and are incredibly likely to cause malfunctions, which will take up more time than simply performing a magazine change.

When it comes down to endorsing a specific candidate or party, I think it is wrong. \n\nThe media set aside dedicated blocks of airtime for political campaigns, and they all pay the same (reduced) rate, so as to provide all parties and candidates the opportunity to have their voice heard. If candidates only needed to buy media at these reduced rates, then they would be able to rely on contributions from individuals alone.\n\nIn the post Citizens United era, politicians must now seek out endorsements from super-PACs to be able to compete. When soliciting small donations from individuals, a candidate is much less likely to become beholden to any one donor. When large special interest groups are able to make unlimited expenditures on ads endorsing candidates, it is much more likely that they would be able to influence the policy of those who are elected- which is similar to bribing the cop to not give you a ticket.\n\nAll in all, Citizens United is having the effect of further corrupting our politicians, as well as contributing to the long, drawn out media battles that those of us in swing states are so sick and tired of.\n\n","duration":"","id":542,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_c6tmytr","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":541,"links":[540],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Zgoos","label":"1-This is a bribe.
