Operation Iraqi Freedom blew the top off the lid as al-Qaida stoked the flames of sectarian violence. Al-Qaida wasn\u0027t in Iraq until we dismantled the Iraqi military. Saddam was a secular Ba\u0027athist who used atrocity to keep a country together whose borders were created by the British and the French on a napkin after World War I. When Saddam was in power, Shiites and Sunnis lived side by side in peace. With the security vacuum made after \"Mission Accomplished,\" foreign terrorists and domestic power seekers exploited Sunni and Shiite differences to further their cause, resulting in a sort of segregation. For example, if you look a map of Baghdad, Sunnis live on one side of the city, Shiites live on another side. Iraq is splitting into 3 parts along ethnic and sectarian differences because it lacks a strongman to keep it together, and I believe we are responsible for it. The last thing we should do is go in thinking we can create positive change. We lit the match to the powder keg, and the Middle East needs to sort this out itself. The Arab Spring was only the beginning. This could last another 30 years. But hopefully in the end, there will be a stable peace and a transformed and more independent Middle East, similar to the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, which created the modern European political environment. They really haven\u0027t had the chance since the fall of the Ottoman Empire to sort things out.

I had the idea a few years ago but recent events brought it back to mind:\n\n\u0026gt; *St. Peter’s Square, Vatican City.  June 2015*\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; A BBC correspondent is frantically trying to fix his hair, unaware that the feed has gone live.  He snaps to attention when he notices the blinking red light and wild gesticulations of his producer,\n\u0026gt; “We’re here live, in the Vatican, where Pope Francis will be making a commentary shortly.  While there is not set agenda for his remarks there is rumor that he will be addressing the rash of ISIS bombings across Europe during the last 18 months.  As you’ll recall Cardinal André Vingt-Trois, Archbishop of Paris, died in a blast four days ago during a service calling for tolerance and echoing the pleas of the Pontiff for peace during the escalating crisis.  Pope Francis has been unwavering in his condemnation of the militant actions of ISIS but has so far been unwilling to advocate any action.  There are many gathered here in prayer on behalf of the late Cardinal who are hoping for something, anything, to do to help bring peace to the situation.”\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; He pauses for a moment, tapping his earpiece, “I’ve just been informed that Pope Francis himself has been in conference with the college of Cardinals over the last two days discussing church policy.  The death of the Cardinal Vingt-Trois shook the church to its core, considered by some to be an open attack on the Holy See after nearly two years of escalating religious violence, and we expect Pope Francis will now address the assembly here.”\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; A hush falls over the crowd in the square.  The last time it had been so full was to announce the new Pope’s assumption of office.  That had been a jubilant day, so full of optimism and hope.  The contrast between that atmosphere and the one present only served to make the former seem much further away, from a different era.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; “John, it’s my understanding that his Holiness will be addressing us in English, so that his words can be understood by the majority gathered.  There will be transmissions later in Spanish, Italian, and Latin.  Let’s go now live to the Holy Father.”\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; The camera switches to a small man, standing on a balcony, adorned in simple white robes.  Pope Francis had gone out of his way to eschew the trappings of his office.  If a plain robe was good enough for Jesus of Nazareth, what need did he have of gold or fine linens?  He briefly thought that those decorations might make what he was about to say more easy- Perhaps, he thought, it might be easier for the world to hear if they had those emblems to draw upon.  He then asked forgiveness for his lack of faith.  He was a servant and the words he bore, not of his own volition, carried the weight of the Almighty.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; He raised his bowed head and looked over the assembly.  Yes, he felt, the words would be enough to reach them. \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; “My brothers, and my sisters, blessings be upon you all.  My heart is heavy in addressing you this day for I must speak of evil things: There is violence in the streets of our land. there is violence in our churches, and in our synagogues, and in our very homes.  We have been patient in the face of such affliction.  We have turned the other cheek.  We have forgiven, not seven times, but seventy times seven times.  We will not be made offenders for a word, but now we cannot ignore the enemy arrayed against us.  All of my life I have endeavored to love my brother and be his keeper.  I have taught as much in word and deed.\"\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; He paused briefly, and his mind wandered to his earlier days in Buenos Aires.  Papers had enjoyed joking about how he must have let in \"losers and lepers\", but they didn\u0027t know that he had been no stranger to violence.  He recalled one night when a young woman had been struck by her boyfriend outside the club- while she lay bleeding from her mouth the young Jose Bergoglio had used his fists to put her suitor in his place.  He recoiled internally remembering how he saw her picture in the paper weeks later, dead at the hand of her lover.  He had blamed himself for escalating the situation without removing the threat entirely and he had learned that half-measures would never be enough.  Against the backdrop of burning cathedrals and maimed Christians across Europe and the middle east he prepared himself to abandoned what he now knew were half-measures.  He continued, \"Now, however, I am compelled by the weight of responsibility upon me to remember the words of Christ who said to his disciples “Do not suppose I have come to bring peace, but a sword”.  When our enemies would harm innocent children, women, when they would spit upon our faith and leave our nations in ruins we can suffer in silence no longer.”\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; “Let those who would fight in our streets to defend their homes now take up arms and wage war against those infidels who make war upon us.  Let us end with victory this war which has begun long ago.  Let those who have been robbers become soldiers.  Let those who fought relatives and neighbors now fight against the barbarians.  Let those who fight for economic security fight now to achieve their eternal reward.  By the authority of this Holy office and as Christ’s herald upon the earth I do beseech you now o publish this everywhere and to persuade all people of whatever rank, foot-soldiers and knights, poor and rich, to carry aid promptly to those Christians and to destroy that vile race from the lands of our friends.”\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; He paused, internally trembling.  His voice had reached a crescendo and to those below the Holy Father seemed to glow.  The stillness was shattered with words that had lain unspoken since they nearly broke the world one thousand years earlier: “Calipha delenda est.  Deus Vult”\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; A cheer broke out among the crowd- There would naturally be those present who spoke Latin.

The room, the air, his very bones shook with the chanting outside “DEUS VULT!  DEUS VULT!”  There was no stopping now what had been set in motion.  He prayed silently for the lives which would be lost.  He prayed for his own soul and for what he had begun.  He imagined that a future text book would contain his words spoken today and following would read “And thus began the Tenth Crusade”.  After his supplication he rose, dried his eyes, and looked to his assistant.  They exchanged a look of grim determination and the man who had been Jose Bergoglio stated “Let’s get to work.”","duration":"","id":71,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_cjk6iby","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":61,"links":[1],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"reddit_dpw","label":"I really hope the middle east unites to fight those savages","duration":"","id":61,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cjk4m3n","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"risley","label":"I fully support Obama on this one.

They\u0027re terrified and outnumbered by armed men who are probably telling them they\u0027re just marching to a prison or camp or something - and also there\u0027s nowhere to hide. But on the other hand, it does seem weird to be laying down for a mass execution, especially when they\u0027re clearly shooting the victims one at a time like that. At any moment, the captured men all could have gotten up and charged the guy(s) with the gun(s) and maybe had a fighting chance. And since they\u0027re allegedly Iraqi Army deserters, they probably have to have some basic level of training. Of course you\u0027re also correct that they shouldn\u0027t have abandoned the post in the first place. \n\nI doubt they\u0027re thinking very logically with that level of anxiety, though. I think I read somewhere that captives often believe they have the best chance of survival or at least a painless death if they follow orders very well. In the past, like World War II era, this might have been true. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s true with extremist religious militants. [I saw one extremely NSFL video of Russian soldiers being executed](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i\u003d315_1313176550) in Dagestan and you see good examples of why cooperation is pointless. One of the captured men did try to run when they were systematically beheading his unit, slowly. Rather than choking to death on his own blood, the guy threw off his attacker and just kept moving every time they tried to cut his throat. It\u0027s one of the most gutsy flight attempts ever. They had to chase him down and shoot him in the back. At least he gave himself a chance. Meanwhile, one guy pleads with them for several minutes and gives them all the information he knows. He does manage to delay his execution for a few minutes. Although one of the militants hesitates after the guy keeps pleading, another one steps right up to offer to kill him.","duration":"","id":211,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_cjkd9nq","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":210,"links":[157],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Delicate-Flower","label":"This is why you never abandon your position.

The photo suggest many of the men are deserters and it makes me sad that they thought they would survive by abandoning their military role when that was actually the best position they had to defend their lives and the lives of their families.\n\nThe video you mention is particularly horrific and I have only heard stories of it. I can\u0027t bring myself to watch it as beheadings are always extremely disconcerting and abhorrent ... especially the example you mentioned because of how cruel and horrific it was. I\u0027m glad one of the men fought for his life. What else is left in that situation?

They\u0027re terrified and outnumbered by armed men who are probably telling them they\u0027re just marching to a prison or camp or something - and also there\u0027s nowhere to hide. But on the other hand, it does seem weird to be laying down for a mass execution, especially when they\u0027re clearly shooting the victims one at a time like that. At any moment, the captured men all could have gotten up and charged the guy(s) with the gun(s) and maybe had a fighting chance. And since they\u0027re allegedly Iraqi Army deserters, they probably have to have some basic level of training. Of course you\u0027re also correct that they shouldn\u0027t have abandoned the post in the first place. \n\nI doubt they\u0027re thinking very logically with that level of anxiety, though. I think I read somewhere that captives often believe they have the best chance of survival or at least a painless death if they follow orders very well. In the past, like World War II era, this might have been true. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s true with extremist religious militants. [I saw one extremely NSFL video of Russian soldiers being executed](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i\u003d315_1313176550) in Dagestan and you see good examples of why cooperation is pointless. One of the captured men did try to run when they were systematically beheading his unit, slowly. Rather than choking to death on his own blood, the guy threw off his attacker and just kept moving every time they tried to cut his throat. It\u0027s one of the most gutsy flight attempts ever. They had to chase him down and shoot him in the back. At least he gave himself a chance. Meanwhile, one guy pleads with them for several minutes and gives them all the information he knows. He does manage to delay his execution for a few minutes. Although one of the militants hesitates after the guy keeps pleading, another one steps right up to offer to kill him.","duration":"","id":211,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_cjkd9nq","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":210,"links":[157],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Delicate-Flower","label":"This is why you never abandon your position.

As is stands, ISIS stands to fall apart as soon as Maliki is gone. The only reason ISIS has done as well as they have, is that they have the (tentative) support of the Sunni tribes in western Iraq. And the only reason these tribes support them is to oust Maliki, who has consistently shown himself to be a Shiite factional leader. By attacking now (if Obama does order airstrikes), Obama makes the US look like it is siding with the Shiites against the Sunnis, and will correspondingly rally more support to ISIS from the Sunnis. \n\nI\u0027m a fan of the humanitarian airdrops, good move.

What you don\u0027t hear, however, are the details of Mossadeq\u0027s downfall. The CIA did not orchestrate a coup in a vacuum. \n\nFollowing Mossadeq\u0027s nationalization/expropriation of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), the UK put Iran under economic sanctions. Without the ability to export oil to the British, the Iranian economy suffered severely, and the Iranian government itself faced serious financial shortfalls (which forced some extreme measures to raise cash). Unsurprisingly, it didn\u0027t take long for the the economic deterioration to have an impact on Mossadeq\u0027s popularity. And while the Iranians were, at first, strongly supportive of Mossadeq\u0027s nationalization plan, that support waned once the economic cost was felt. Furthermore, Mossadeq\u0027s continued refusal to even negotiate with the British on the issue of nationalization and their emgargo did a lot of damage to his domestic reputation.\n\nAs his popularity shrank and his political enemies grew in number, Mossadeq\u0027s committment to democracy waned. He held a \"referrendum\" - internationally referred to as a \"farce\" - to grant himself \"emergency powers\" to rule by decree in which apparently 99.95% of Iranians voted \"yes\". It was a very efficient election, with such innovations as ending the secret ballot\nHe later moved on from rigging elections to suspending them entirely, and then when that wasn\u0027t enough, started imprisoning his political opponents. By the time of the coup, Mossadeq was neither popular, nor democratic. He was just another tin-pot dictator.\n\nOf course, we should look at the other side too. Mossadeq wrote a number of letters to Truman and later Eisenhower asking for increased economic aid to deal with the economic consequence\u0027s of Britain\u0027s embargo. Both Truman and Eisenhower refused, at the request of Winston Churchill. \n\nIn the end he sent a cable threatening that if Eisenhower didn\u0027t provide the economic aid he was asking for, he\u0027d go to Stalin instead. Regardless of the morality of the situation, I hope we can all agree that at the height of the Cold War, while the US was actively preparing for the possibility of a nuclear war with the Soviet Union, this was probably a Really Dumb Idea (TM). It was also what convinced Eisenhower to give the CIA approval for Operation Ajax.\n\nNow, I don\u0027t mean to excuse American culpability for their involvement in Iran, but the situation was a lot murkier than the popular narrative leads people to believe.","duration":"","id":479,"color":"black","redditID":"t1_cjku912","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":477,"links":[476],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"limeythepomme","label":"That wouldn\u0027t have happened without US meddling, the CIA toppled a popular government who wanted to modernise the country and nationalise their oil, instead the US backed military coup created a deeply unpopular and oppressive regime against whom only the religious leaders were able to speak out.

Having as many super carriers as us is very useful, but if you can\u0027t keep them supplied with food, fuel, bombs, and ammo, its not going to matter. Unlike say Russia or China, the United States has the ability to commit to a conflict just about anywhere in the world, and keep it up. Russia might be able to do something (Excluding whatever the fuck is going on in the Ukraine), but if they deployed anything, it wouldn\u0027t be able to stay there for to long. China has a massive army and a competent military all around, but they can\u0027t stay in theater like the U.S. can.\n\nEurope technically has the ability to, but it would require a deep restructuring of how they deploy military forces, that would also include a lot of politics, like making the EU an actual unified military force (EU battle groups are nowhere near integrated enough to handle this). Having a big military is great for defense, but being able to supply that military as well as the United States does is very hard. Even the recent French intervention in Mali required some U.S. logistical support. And France is probably the most independent military from the United States in Western Europe. \n\nThere is a saying that you\u0027ll hear, mainly when looking at the pacific war in world war 2, that amateurs discuss tactics, but professionals discuss logistics.\n\nAlso, because this is Reddit, I\u0027ll just add that there are lots of other reasons why the U.S. is normally the one to respond to these types of situations. Our logistical capabilities are a major reason why, but don\u0027t disregard just how amazingly well United States combat personal are capable of accomplishing their mission, and general political reasons.","duration":"","id":1081,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cjkb16i","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":996,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"thefckestupest","label":"This is a genuine question.

China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, India, and South Korea.  Add them all up, all the money that all of them spend.  Nine of the ten most expensive militaries in the world.  That\u0027s what America spends.","duration":"","id":1085,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cjk8xr5","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":996,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"thefckestupest","label":"This is a genuine question.

They are reacting to a fatwa issued in May by Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, the world’s most influential Sunni sharia authority and the Muslim Brotherhood’s chief jurist. Qaradawi declared that the jihad in Syria against Assad and his Shiite backers — primarily, Iran-backed Hezbollah — is a duty for every able-bodied Muslim who is trained to fight.\n\n\u0026gt;Qaradawi, who also serves as the backbone of international support for Hamas — the terrorist organization that is the Brotherhood’s Palestinian branch — is notoriously anti-American and anti-Israeli. His prior fatwas, in addition to fomenting murderous rioting over such trivial slights as the publication of unflattering cartoon images of the prophet Mohammed, have called for the killing of American military and support personnel in Iraq, as well as suicide bombings against Israel. Crucially for current purposes, Qaradawi has been the powerhouse behind the Brotherhood’s Syrian enterprise — drumming up international political and financial support for the “rebels.” It is no coincidence that shortly after Qaradawi’s fatwa, Egypt’s Islamic-supremacist government — then led by the Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi — cut off diplomatic ties with Assad, called for a no-fly zone over Syria, and declaimed that “Hezbollah must leave Syria.”\n\nThese groups are extremely sectarian. A leader of one of the most powerful units in the FSA was filmed eating an organ from a dead Syrian soldier and promising to slaughter all Alawites. \n\nThe membership between the FSA and al Qaeda offshoots like the ISIS has been pretty fluid too, with many FSA units changing their allegiance to the ISIS as they become more extreme. The fact that they\u0027re close is shown by the praise that FSA commanders have heaped on their al Qaeda affiliated counterparts:\n\n\u0026gt;Consistent with the Obama/McCain approach of blinking at reality, the administration formally declared Nusra a terrorist organization back in December, as if that would deter the FSA militias — many of which publicly scoffed at the maneuver. Despite what Zarate and Moore assert, Nusra continues to [work closely](http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2013/06/al_nusrah_front_clai_14.php) with the FSA.\n\n\u0026gt;Among those [lavishing praise](http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130422/syrias-nusra-urged-abandon-qaeda-pledge) on Nusra for doing “very well in its jihad against the tyrant regime of Damascus” is Qaradawi. Through his International Union of Muslim Scholars, he has urged Nusra to reconsider its pledge of fealty to al-Qaeda, reasoning that “this pledge causes internal and external dangers, and its impact on the revolution is dangerous because it breaks the ranks of the mujahideen.” Translation: “Hey Nusra, go right ahead with your savage methods, but could you pipe down about the al-Qaeda connection? That way, the morons in Washington will pretend you’re a ‘moderate’ and keep giving us the money and weapons we need.”","duration":"","id":1327,"color":"black","redditID":"t1_cjkp7f5","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1326,"links":[1325],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"UrinalCake777","label":"Syria drops bombs on civilian populations, then after about 15 minutes, when a decent sized crowd has gathered to help dig out people trapped in the ruble, they drop a second bomb in the same place.

The loss of abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia is still a very sore subject to those people even though its arguable that it helped assure western ties for georgia.

I don\u0027t support a ground invasion. Wouldn\u0027t accomplish much in my opinion other than getting a lot of Americans killed. \n\nInstead, I say we work diplomatically to recognize Kurdistan as a nation and as an ally and support them through trade incentives, maybe some sort of international scholarship programs so they can bring their infrastructure into the 21st century, and providing arms and stuff to the Kurdish military. At the same time, we\u0027d have to make sure the Iraqi and Kurdish borders are mutually agreed upon. Then the two nations can unite, kill the shit out of ISIS with U.S. air support and financial support, then return to the (very) relative stability they had prior to the incursion of ISIS with US ground forces out of the picture.\n\nIn realizing Kurdistan, perhaps we can accomplish this by lending diplomatic support to the accession of Turkey into the EU, as having them surrender territory to the Kurds (it\u0027s Kurdish lands anyways) is a major hurdle. Perhaps we can broker a deal between Kurdistan and Turkey to build some grand oil pipeline between the two nations or *something*. They already have a working deal to where the Kurds supply Turkey with crude oil in exchange for refined petroleum, which is great. Kurdistan will need to export but is landlocked, and Turkey is the best route of moving product. Furthermore, Kurdistan has many mineral resources and provided greater stability, these can lend the region a fair bit of economic wealth so they can get on their own two legs. In getting the Iranian Kurds in... I don\u0027t think that\u0027s feasible, *but* perhaps we can just recommend that they provide Kurdish citizenship to all Iranian Kurds similar to what the deal was with Israel and the Jews. \n\nTo create more peace between Iran and Kurdistan, a lot of it would revolve around economic sanctions and the Iranian nuclear program, as well as the relations between those two governments.

Let me first explain what is happening with the Iraqi government, in todays date. After Saddams death, all of the different organziations in Iraq (sunni, shia, kurds) made a huge leap in action to take a piece of iraq for their own people. The Kurds, whom were and are still hated by all they other groups (shia, sunni), claim that northern iraq belongs to them. Problem is, it isnt. The entire northern part of Iraq belongs to the Assyrian people, a population of sum 2million that date back to ancient mesopatamia 4000 years ago. The Assyrians because of their Christian faith do not believe in fighting and war so they are picked on alot by all of those other groups of the muslim faith (suni, shia, kurds). When saddam was in check, the northern part of iraq was protected by saddam for christians to live in peace, all of this while saddam put the kurds and other groups in check. Once the u.s. intervened, iraq fell apart and all organizations went at war with eachother. The shia, whom have been enemys with kurds and assyrians for centurys are of a different prespective. They also seek their own land to settle on but because of their numbers, they are unable to form a military group. There is no Kurdish Iraq, the kurds never had a country in Iraq.

Western nations, including the U.S. and Russia along with Western Europe do bear some responsibility individually and collectively they own most of it.  Decades of action, through destabilization campaigns, propping up dictatorships, and subverting democratic movements for the sake of global strategic goals have created the modern Middle East.  **HOWEVER,** inaction has also proven to be just as dangerous. We have stood by and watched as the innocent are slaughtered, populations are starved, and children are kidnapped, brainwashed, and turned into soldiers or raped to their death.  The power of all great nations is wielded in the double-edge sword of action and inaction.  In a perfect world, even in a slightly more just but still imperfect world,  we might wish for all great powers to use their might always against the evil-doers, and shepherd the weak from the shadow of the valley of death. It would be the just law for it to be so automatically.  But our world is neither perfect not sufficiently just, for that to be the reality and thus war will always steamroll through villages and playgrounds. **BUT** we can often read intent and purpose clearly and when the power of the mighty strikes the unjust for no other gain that so safeguard the lives of the most maligned and marginalized who own nothing and owe us nothing, we take a step closer to that just world.  Syria, Palestine, Ukraine, Yemen, Somalia, Chechnya, etc. will unfortunately continue to bleed out their best and brightest without outside intervention, no one in the world has the fortitude to risk involvement. But ISIS can be confronted now, before our inaction becomes yet another misstep in the history of the great powers.
