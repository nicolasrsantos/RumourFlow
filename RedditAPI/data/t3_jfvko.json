One question: how many of those companies are either non-profits or state-owned entities?

It makes no difference how much they love to cut costs, because they have no control over the process. I really didn\u0027t think it would be a controversial point.\n\nCompanies are not in business to make a cheap product, they are in business to make profits, and for public firms like most pharmas, they are legally required to focus on making as much profit as possible because they have a fiduciary duty to their shareholders. If they make a cheap product, they sell it for the highest price they can. If they can sell you on a loss leader, but get their money back in spades over the long term like Microsoft does with the Xbox 360, so much the better. If they develop a product that makes their primary product line obsolete without replacing it with another revenue stream of equal or greater value, they shred everything related, bury the corpses and salt the earth over the grave. Profit is their sole purpose for existence, not minimizing government outlays.

Gene therapy has entered a new era of late, where experiments are better thought out and proper safety studies are being conducted. But 10 years ago was a different story, where studies were often unnecessary, poorly designed and the proper animal studies were not conducted. \n\nThe gene therapy field was put back a decade by the poor science pushed by gene therapists. It resulted in deaths. At one lecture I heard a scientist describe the \"most successful gene therapy trial\" in history. 10 kids \"cured\" of their disease, seven of them later developed leukemia. But that was ok, leukemia is treatable!\n\nFYI, they used the same type of virus as this study. The problem wasn\u0027t really the virus though, but the gene they over expressed. \n\nLet me ask this, would you always want your white blood cells in overdrive? What is the long term consequence of this? An auto-immune disease for example? I suppose the purpose is for there to be a long-term, but in general these therapies should only be explored for conditions that really warrant this sort of high-risk treatment.\n","duration":"","id":76,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c2bwbn5","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Cancer cured with harmless, modified HIV: \"As the white cells killed the cancer cells, the patients experienced the fevers and aches and pains that one would expect when the body is fighting off an infection, but beyond that the side effects have been minimal\"","label":"mepper","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_jfvko","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.313112877E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.313155928E9,"simScore":0.6952619900037336,"sentiment":"  Positive"},{"index":77,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"kyleisagod","label":"All of these stories, lately, about cancer and awesome drug-things make me think of one thing - zombies.","duration":"","id":77,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c2bselk","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Cancer cured with harmless, modified HIV: \"As the white cells killed the cancer cells, the patients experienced the fevers and aches and pains that one would expect when the body is fighting off an infection, but beyond that the side effects have been minimal\"","label":"mepper","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_jfvko","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.313112877E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.313123848E9,"simScore":0.7631819779942199,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":78,"links":[77],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"irishjoe","label":"Cures your cancer but eats your brains...BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAINS!!!!!","duration":"","id":78,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_c2bue8v","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":77,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"kyleisagod","label":"All of these stories, lately, about cancer and awesome drug-things make me think of one thing - zombies.","duration":"","id":77,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c2bselk","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Cancer cured with harmless, modified HIV: \"As the white cells killed the cancer cells, the patients experienced the fevers and aches and pains that one would expect when the body is fighting off an infection, but beyond that the side effects have been minimal\"","label":"mepper","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_jfvko","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.313112877E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.313123848E9,"simScore":0.7631819779942199,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.313139306E9,"simScore":0.6910416624612279,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":79,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"powercow","label":"another week and another cure for cancer..
