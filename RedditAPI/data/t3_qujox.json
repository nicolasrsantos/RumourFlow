Of course, one does not simply measure the emperor\u0027s nose--you\u0027d lose your topknot and about a foot of head to go with it. So they devised a plan to learn the Emperor\u0027s nose length by poll. They went around China polling everyone they could as to how long they thought the emperor\u0027s nose was, then calculated the average--the point being that it\u0027s utterly useless to poll people about facts.\n\nOf course, this is clearly more on the order of \"push-poll\", and the polling agency obviously has some interest in perpetuating the idea that Obama is \"other\".","duration":"","id":4,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c40mmye","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"The Problem With Polls About Whether Obama Is a Muslim","label":"scientologist2","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_qujox","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.331677272E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.331691497E9,"simScore":0.7470358748120971,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},{"index":5,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"steelchicken","label":"I don\u0027t care if he is a Muslim.
