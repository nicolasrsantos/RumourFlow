However,  economically speaking, an economy that is fair is relatively inefficient, whereas an efficient economy is relatively unfair. There\u0027s this feudalistic idea or sense of living that the government is somehow our Lord and ruler, that same idea brings about new age guilds, something communal outside the realms of the feudalistic rule and system. Could have swore we left this kind of crap back in the 13th and 14th century where it belongs, I was wrong.\n\nAs a philosophical or paradoxical tangent, the concept of interest just blows my mind. Lending someone a set principal of money, then they want the same amount back, and then some. Where the hell is the interest supposed to come from?\n\nThere was a guy in Britain who gave his company to his workers, an attempt at utopian society. The workers built schools around their factory, housing, the whole nine yards, but when everyone is earning the same amount as my history professor pointed out, is there incentive to work harder if the next person just gets the same amount for less hard work? It would take serious organization as adele pointed out. And my comment or opinion about it all is, perspective. Its all about people\u0027s perspective. If there were anything, in a circumspective view, that I could tell the world, is 1) stop fighting your fellow human beings 2) use perspective to perceive things how others do, in an attempt to understand them. It is the same garbage these days that was existent hundreds and hundreds of years ago, it\u0027s only modernized with us.\nI.e. Romans thought Christians were cannibals and persecuted them.

I can understand the concern about defined contribution plans being vulnerable to market losses because of risky investments, but private sector defined benefits plans you can\u0027t assume will provide 100% of the promised benefits either.  Even if the company doesn\u0027t go under they can freeze the defined benefits plan at any time and if you don\u0027t have enough years to be vested you have nothing.","duration":"","id":82,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_c73eqdc","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":81,"links":[80],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Almonjin","label":"I will assume you are correct about the CEO payraise situation, but I think you\u0027re missing the point I\u0027m making.

You can argue they should bite the bullet again to save their jobs, but if their division is sold off to a more competent competitor, it could save them having to gut their own pensions yet again for a company that is obviously being severely mismanaged.\n\nIf this example proves anything it should be that union representatives should have a mandatory seat on the board of a given company, like in Sweden I believe. Workers are stakeholders in the success of a company, and having another, non-subservient party there to give another perspective to management is hardly a bad idea. \n","duration":"","id":81,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_c73ba3e","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":80,"links":[79],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"SAugsburger","label":"\u0026gt;Oh, and most of what you said is incorrect.

My dad owns a construction company (started by his father) which has been hit extremely hard by the recession, as many such businesses have been. He\u0027s gone the past few years with little to no pay (yes, the CEO has waived his own pay in order to continue paying his employees). He eventually went to the union heads hoping they would understand the sacrifices that needed to be made in order to save the company and therefore continue to provide much-needed jobs. The union wouldn\u0027t give him an inch, even requiring that the company give the union employees raises. They (the union employees) have shown absolutely no loyalty to the company, only to themselves.

So when negotiation time rolls around and the union asks what it should be fighting for, the overwhelming majority says the top priority is a higher journeyman wage. So all of the career workers spend the last 20+ years of their career fighting for it.\n\nOver time, you can see how this would lead to stagnate pay at lower levels while rocketing the journeyman wage upward. Give it enough time, and businesses start looking for ways to cut labor costs. In union grocery stores, automated checkout systems are the popular method now. A store running 20 cashiers over the course of a day can get 30% or more of their business through self-check machines run by 2 people: 30% of total business for 10% of total labor. And people complain that these machines are stealing jobs from real workers, but no company in it\u0027s right mind is going to be able to stay competitive with others if it doesn\u0027t jump on new technology that lowers costs.\n\nIt\u0027s about staying competitive, and right now the union cycle ends with the labor force pricing itself out of the market. The reason our food, teacher, and law enforcement unions have weathered the storm is because they are service jobs that can\u0027t be outsourced.","duration":"","id":105,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_c734zg1","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":104,"links":[76],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"cumfarts","label":"\u0026gt; The full time, high seniority guys make more than $32/hour.

This is exactly how the contract is structured.  Pretty much everyone is hired as a part time employee at $8.50/hour (unless minimum wage is higher in that state and then they get minimum.)  After that, they will get the negotiated raises at designated intervals.  $1 at 90 days, $.50 at one year, and so on until they have reached five years and then their raises are the annual contract raises that everyone receives.  No bonus for effort...the exact same dollar amount as everyone else.\n\nIt can take 5-10 years to have enough union seniority to bid for a full time position.  The length of time depends on the local environment: how many people are retiring, how many people are ahead of you, how the work levels are fluctuating, etc.  Once you get a full time job, it takes another 3 years to reach the top of the payscale...the $32/hour.  So it can take 8-13 years on average for a new hire to reach a decent pay rate.  It also means that the guys who have achieved it tend to stick around so there aren\u0027t very many openings for the newer guys.\n\nWe have charts and charts of pay rates to keep track of.  It doesn\u0027t matter how good your performance is...you get paid based on how long you\u0027ve worked there and what type of work you were doing that day.

The reason the american middle calss has been shrinking is not because of the loss of unions it is because of the rise of free trade.  Free trade allows companies to source their workers from a country that doesn\u0027t have worker\u0027s rights.  First they went to Mexico.  In america the unions fought for laws around hours, healthcare days to work a week, firing and pay.  Mexico had no laws about that so American corporations moved as many jobs as they could there.  Then whenever the standard of living rises so that they demand more pay or laws are passed to improve workers rights - anything that impacts the companies bottom line - they pic up shop and move to the next country that has no worker\u0027s rights.  Maybe its China now.  Their middle class grows but when they start demanding more rights, better working conditions etc.  they will just move on to the next country.  There will always be another country that is worse off and the reason for that is when the corporations leave the country they were in will actually be worse off than before the jobs arrived.  It is happening in mexico right now.  Standard of living is falling there, unemployment drugs violence.  Its a mess and its because of NAFTA.  We could have free trade with countries that have similar economic standards of living and worker\u0027s rights but but free trade with a lower status country just means companies can avoid the laws in their country.

America: You fought and sent a clear message to the powers that be by rejecting the notion that money should equate to power. If you want that work to pay off, you need to start understanding the power and importance of unions or it\u0027s all for naught.","subreddit":"politics","subredditId":"t5_2cneq","thumbnail":"self","selftext":"After reading a significant amount of anti-union sentiment on reddit, it was a good reminder that Americans claim to want one thing (a stronger middle class, better treatment of workers, healthcare for all) and they tend to contradict that sentiment with this blind distaste for unions.\n\nLet\u0027s acknowledge a few things first: As the unions have gone, so has the middle class. So has health care. So have fair wages. So have pensions and security. So has the workers\u0027 voice. \n\nNow a little bit about the history of the American worker and the necessity of the union: Deep in the coalfields of Appalachia, there was a time long after slavery was abolished where poor people were treated like slaves. They worked in horrid conditions, regularly exposed to dangerous situations where they were sickened and died in order to make a wage that wouldn\u0027t even cover the costs of living. Many of them were paid in company script and were forced to live in company provided housing. That script was only good at the local store that was owned by the company. So by the time the worker paid his rent to the company and bought a few things at the company store to keep his family fed, there was nothing left.\n\nWell, the miners knew this wasn\u0027t a fair shake and they decided to stand up and demand actual pay and some safe conditions. They stood together, they fought, many died and they won the right to make demands from the company and its management. \n\nUpon doing so, they set a standard for workers everywhere and proved a point: Corporations were inherently designed to make the worker give up everything possible and to get the job done for the least amount of compensation possible. And then some. And unions spread across most industries and workers *knew* that if they wanted to be fairly compensated and to be treated like humans, they *had* to unionize. They needed strength to stand up to an entity loaded with money and lawyers and they were able to do that by investing in unions. After all, all unions were/are is a collective of average workers who demand a voice in how they are treated.\n\nThe middle class expanded at a record rate. American families had nice homes, a decent car (sometimes two), amazing health care, pensions, so that they could one day retire by paying into the company plan. Fair amounts of vacation and sick days. A voice in the collective direction of the company and representation should they need it if they are treated unfairly. America was the envy of the entire world at this point and equality was as solid as it had ever been in the history of the United States.\n\nFast forward to the early 80s: Ronald Reagan is president. He is working with an organized group of people who, like most current republicans, see the middle class as a drain on society and a bunch of leeches with too much power. The RICH should be running the show and the rich cannot run the show as long as the middle class are organized, active and making fair wages. So he started a push to put an end to that.\n\nAnd from that time on, unions were demonized in the media, they were made to seem like an outdated idea, they were made to look corrupt and greedy, they were made to blame anytime business went bad. Americans were living great, successful lives and started to buy into the media backlash on the unions. Because when you\u0027re doing well, have a cache of vacation days, amazing wages, health care, a fat pension as a worker, then you start to think, *\"I don\u0027t need a union! Look how well I\u0027m doing! These union fees are a waste of my money and I don\u0027t always agree with them anyway!\"*\n\nSo the people bought into it. The same way that many republicans buy into irrational ideas today as promoted by Fox News, et al. During that era, American equality started to shift to the ultra wealthy. Middle class wealth started to slide away. Companies busted unions left and right and that was acceptable because they were \u0027bad and corrupt and outdated.\u0027 The middle class started to shrink significantly and quickly.\n\nFast forward 30+ years: The middle class is smaller than it\u0027s been in 40 years and continues to shrink. The wealth of the middle class is at record lows while corporate profits are at records highs in many cases. Pensions and health care are considered \u0027luxuries\u0027 instead of standard. Wage freezes are common, vacation days limited, sick days are frowned upon from ever direction of upper management. People are *again* working for the least amount of compensation possible by the company who takes the money the workers *should* be earning for their role in the company and those funds are sent directly up to the top.\n\n**We\u0027re made to believe that if a company is successful, it\u0027s because of an amazing team of ultra qualified managers who make $17 million per year plus huge bonuses. BUT, if the company is struggling, it\u0027s all the fault of the workers who demand too much and don\u0027t work hard enough and are a drain on the company itself.**\n\nLike all false narratives, this is to create the means to an end: To continue treating American workers like they\u0027re leeches, to continue taking from them instead of giving..to make sure they don\u0027t make any kind of progress in wages or benefits.\n\nAnd that\u0027s ultimately what we saw with Hostess: A team of managers who were incapable of running a successful, competitive company and then demanding concessions from the *workers* as a result, all the while, giving the CEO and upper management huge raises of ridiculous sums. \n\nBut here\u0027s the bottom line, America: Unions built the middle class. They set the standards for working Americans: the 40-hour workweek, the paid vacation, the paid sick days, the health care, the pensions, the overtime pay, etc, etc. And as the unions have gone, so have those elements of what made us a successful nation and what built the middle class so well and so quickly. They *demanded* this stuff. They *knew* their worth as workers and they organized and stood up to speak in a single, consistent voice with legal representatives and by maintaining certain standards of work, production and output.\n\nAmericans stood up to collectively demand that things like Citizens United should be overturned and that the concept should be refuted. They stood up to defend things like Social Security, medicare, and other programs that ensure that Americans have a safety net and that the weakest Americans should still have a shot at a good life.\n\nBut if you think you can hand this power over to politicians and that\u0027s the end of it, you\u0027re wrong. Now is the time for Americans to become the active, organized, intelligent people they were going all the way back to those coal fields in West Virginia and Kentucky. I can promise you....if you\u0027re against unions, much of it is the result of what you\u0027ve *heard* rather than what you\u0027ve learned. The same reason that republicans who watch Fox News think that Obama is a muslim, a kenyan, a socialist, etc. I find it laughable when people are smart enough to realize those Fox News lies were created specifically to demonize Obama but when it comes to lies about Unions, they tend to believe those lies unquestionably as fact. \n\nIs there corruption in unions? Of course there is in some unions. Is there corruption in every level of government in some places? Absolutely. Is there corruption in companies and corporations, in their management and policies? ABSOLUTELY. Is there corruption in churches and school systems? Yes...so the point is that because there are pockets of corruption, you don\u0027t completely do away with and demonize government, corporations, churches, school systems, etc. You realize they\u0027re necessary and you eliminate the corruption and move them forward.\n\nIf Americans continue to buy into the right\u0027s deeply held concept that unions are bad for America, they\u0027ll never, ever move forward to reach the point where they were at the time whenever equality was at record levels and every American had a certain amount of safety nets provided to them by the companies they help make successful and profitable. It\u0027s that simple. And the idea of unions are *not* outdated. Anywhere there are people who are working for the success of a company, those people need to be organized so that there is communication between management and those who are being managed. \n\nWill it take balls? Yes. Your great-grandparents had them. Will it take a lot of work? Yes..your great-grandparents proved that it can be done with hard work. But until it happens, companies like Walmart will continue to pay sub-standard wages, control hours to avoid obligations of health care and benefits, they will continue outsourcing their jobs overseas anytime it\u0027s possible, they will always be trying to freeze wages and make *one* worker do the work of *two* or *three* people. \n\nSo it\u0027s time to move the country forward from the middle instead of from the top. And politicians *cannot* make this happen on their own...they need the work and the commitment of the middle class to stand up for themselves the way coal miners did at the Battle of Blair Mountain back in 1921. ","selftextHTML":"\u0026lt;!-- SC_OFF --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div class\u003d\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;After reading a significant amount of anti-union sentiment on reddit, it was a good reminder that Americans claim to want one thing (a stronger middle class, better treatment of workers, healthcare for all) and they tend to contradict that sentiment with this blind distaste for unions.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Let\u0026amp;#39;s acknowledge a few things first: As the unions have gone, so has the middle class. So has health care. So have fair wages. So have pensions and security. So has the workers\u0026amp;#39; voice. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Now a little bit about the history of the American worker and the necessity of the union: Deep in the coalfields of Appalachia, there was a time long after slavery was abolished where poor people were treated like slaves. They worked in horrid conditions, regularly exposed to dangerous situations where they were sickened and died in order to make a wage that wouldn\u0026amp;#39;t even cover the costs of living. Many of them were paid in company script and were forced to live in company provided housing. That script was only good at the local store that was owned by the company. So by the time the worker paid his rent to the company and bought a few things at the company store to keep his family fed, there was nothing left.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Well, the miners knew this wasn\u0026amp;#39;t a fair shake and they decided to stand up and demand actual pay and some safe conditions. They stood together, they fought, many died and they won the right to make demands from the company and its management. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Upon doing so, they set a standard for workers everywhere and proved a point: Corporations were inherently designed to make the worker give up everything possible and to get the job done for the least amount of compensation possible. And then some. And unions spread across most industries and workers \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;knew\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; that if they wanted to be fairly compensated and to be treated like humans, they \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;had\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; to unionize. They needed strength to stand up to an entity loaded with money and lawyers and they were able to do that by investing in unions. After all, all unions were/are is a collective of average workers who demand a voice in how they are treated.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The middle class expanded at a record rate. American families had nice homes, a decent car (sometimes two), amazing health care, pensions, so that they could one day retire by paying into the company plan. Fair amounts of vacation and sick days. A voice in the collective direction of the company and representation should they need it if they are treated unfairly. America was the envy of the entire world at this point and equality was as solid as it had ever been in the history of the United States.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Fast forward to the early 80s: Ronald Reagan is president. He is working with an organized group of people who, like most current republicans, see the middle class as a drain on society and a bunch of leeches with too much power. The RICH should be running the show and the rich cannot run the show as long as the middle class are organized, active and making fair wages. So he started a push to put an end to that.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;And from that time on, unions were demonized in the media, they were made to seem like an outdated idea, they were made to look corrupt and greedy, they were made to blame anytime business went bad. Americans were living great, successful lives and started to buy into the media backlash on the unions. Because when you\u0026amp;#39;re doing well, have a cache of vacation days, amazing wages, health care, a fat pension as a worker, then you start to think, \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;\u0026amp;quot;I don\u0026amp;#39;t need a union! Look how well I\u0026amp;#39;m doing! These union fees are a waste of my money and I don\u0026amp;#39;t always agree with them anyway!\u0026amp;quot;\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So the people bought into it. The same way that many republicans buy into irrational ideas today as promoted by Fox News, et al. During that era, American equality started to shift to the ultra wealthy. Middle class wealth started to slide away. Companies busted unions left and right and that was acceptable because they were \u0026amp;#39;bad and corrupt and outdated.\u0026amp;#39; The middle class started to shrink significantly and quickly.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Fast forward 30+ years: The middle class is smaller than it\u0026amp;#39;s been in 40 years and continues to shrink. The wealth of the middle class is at record lows while corporate profits are at records highs in many cases. Pensions and health care are considered \u0026amp;#39;luxuries\u0026amp;#39; instead of standard. Wage freezes are common, vacation days limited, sick days are frowned upon from ever direction of upper management. People are \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;again\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; working for the least amount of compensation possible by the company who takes the money the workers \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;should\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; be earning for their role in the company and those funds are sent directly up to the top.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;We\u0026amp;#39;re made to believe that if a company is successful, it\u0026amp;#39;s because of an amazing team of ultra qualified managers who make $17 million per year plus huge bonuses. BUT, if the company is struggling, it\u0026amp;#39;s all the fault of the workers who demand too much and don\u0026amp;#39;t work hard enough and are a drain on the company itself.\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Like all false narratives, this is to create the means to an end: To continue treating American workers like they\u0026amp;#39;re leeches, to continue taking from them instead of giving..to make sure they don\u0026amp;#39;t make any kind of progress in wages or benefits.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;And that\u0026amp;#39;s ultimately what we saw with Hostess: A team of managers who were incapable of running a successful, competitive company and then demanding concessions from the \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;workers\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; as a result, all the while, giving the CEO and upper management huge raises of ridiculous sums. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;But here\u0026amp;#39;s the bottom line, America: Unions built the middle class. They set the standards for working Americans: the 40-hour workweek, the paid vacation, the paid sick days, the health care, the pensions, the overtime pay, etc, etc. And as the unions have gone, so have those elements of what made us a successful nation and what built the middle class so well and so quickly. They \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;demanded\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; this stuff. They \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;knew\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; their worth as workers and they organized and stood up to speak in a single, consistent voice with legal representatives and by maintaining certain standards of work, production and output.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Americans stood up to collectively demand that things like Citizens United should be overturned and that the concept should be refuted. They stood up to defend things like Social Security, medicare, and other programs that ensure that Americans have a safety net and that the weakest Americans should still have a shot at a good life.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;But if you think you can hand this power over to politicians and that\u0026amp;#39;s the end of it, you\u0026amp;#39;re wrong. Now is the time for Americans to become the active, organized, intelligent people they were going all the way back to those coal fields in West Virginia and Kentucky. I can promise you....if you\u0026amp;#39;re against unions, much of it is the result of what you\u0026amp;#39;ve \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;heard\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; rather than what you\u0026amp;#39;ve learned. The same reason that republicans who watch Fox News think that Obama is a muslim, a kenyan, a socialist, etc. I find it laughable when people are smart enough to realize those Fox News lies were created specifically to demonize Obama but when it comes to lies about Unions, they tend to believe those lies unquestionably as fact. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Is there corruption in unions? Of course there is in some unions. Is there corruption in every level of government in some places? Absolutely. Is there corruption in companies and corporations, in their management and policies? ABSOLUTELY. Is there corruption in churches and school systems? Yes...so the point is that because there are pockets of corruption, you don\u0026amp;#39;t completely do away with and demonize government, corporations, churches, school systems, etc. You realize they\u0026amp;#39;re necessary and you eliminate the corruption and move them forward.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If Americans continue to buy into the right\u0026amp;#39;s deeply held concept that unions are bad for America, they\u0026amp;#39;ll never, ever move forward to reach the point where they were at the time whenever equality was at record levels and every American had a certain amount of safety nets provided to them by the companies they help make successful and profitable. It\u0026amp;#39;s that simple. And the idea of unions are \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;not\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; outdated. Anywhere there are people who are working for the success of a company, those people need to be organized so that there is communication between management and those who are being managed. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Will it take balls? Yes. Your great-grandparents had them. Will it take a lot of work? Yes..your great-grandparents proved that it can be done with hard work. But until it happens, companies like Walmart will continue to pay sub-standard wages, control hours to avoid obligations of health care and benefits, they will continue outsourcing their jobs overseas anytime it\u0026amp;#39;s possible, they will always be trying to freeze wages and make \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;one\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; worker do the work of \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;two\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;three\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; people. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So it\u0026amp;#39;s time to move the country forward from the middle instead of from the top.
