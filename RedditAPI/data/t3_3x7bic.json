From his [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz):\n\n\u0026gt;Cruz graduated cum laude from Princeton University with a Bachelor of Arts in Public Policy[34] from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs in 1992.[35][3] While at Princeton, he competed for the American Whig-Cliosophic Society\u0027s Debate Panel and won the top speaker award at both the 1992 U.S. National Debating Championship and the 1992 North American Debating Championship.[36] In 1992, he was named U.S. National Speaker of the Year, and with his debate partner David Panton won Team of the Year.[36] Cruz and Panton would later represent Harvard Law School at the 1995 World Debating Championship, losing in the semi-finals to a team from Australia.[37][38][39] Princeton\u0027s debate team named their annual novice championship after Cruz.[39]\n\nJust because he says things doesnt mean he believes them.  He understands how people will react to them.","duration":"","id":587,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cy2e97t","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":586,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"tmoney67","label":"Does Ted Cruz look like an intelligent person in any way, form or function?","duration":"","id":586,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cy27clr","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Ted Cruz says that Obama has \"made anti-Muslim speech illegal,\" despite the fact that he and the other Republican candidates engage in anti-Muslim speech all the time and amazingly enough, don\u0027t get arrested","label":"grendels-dad","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_3x7bic","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.450380276E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.450390094E9,"simScore":0.6343449059339172,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.450401642E9,"simScore":0.7908103119650528,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.450401642E9,"simScore":0.8420294004701547,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},{"index":589,"links":[586],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"spike96","label":"I still cant believe he graduated from Princeton and Harvard Law.

One of the great things about being an American is being able to speak our opinion without the fear of the government of stopping us, or imprisoning us. In fact, this is one of the most used statements that define the difference between \"us\" and \"them\" when speaking about countries with strict regimes that punish those who speak out against the government, in any manner. \n\nHowever, the gray area is when you convey your opinion as a fact, by spoken word it is called Slander. By written word it is called Libel. \n\n\nSaying \"All Islamic people are Terrorist\" could be considered Slander (or Libel if printed).  Because this is not a true statement.  \n\nSaying \"You THINK all Islamic people are Terrorist\" is covered by freedom of speech, because adding in the \"in your opinion\" or \"I think that...\"  allows you to say whatever you like. \n\nAll in all, nothing stops anyone from calling you a \"Twat\" for saying that statement.
