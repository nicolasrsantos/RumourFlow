Having something in common does not make grounds for a logical comparison. There are apes in Africa, but I hope this doesn\u0027t make it  logical to call Africans apes (at least not any moreso than it is to call all people apes.)\n\n\u0026gt;So if you look at it *\"objectively,\"* you can see that all sexual acts are in the same line.  And with gay marriage being illegal in most of the country, then it has that in common with beastiality....or plural marriage for that matter.\n\nThis is not true. Gay marriage is legal in 36 states today, accounting for well over 50% of the population. You have also equated sex acts to marriage a few times, when the two need not coincide. Sodomy laws have been struck down everywhere in the US for over a decade, while many (but not all) states have beastiality laws on the books.\n\nYour overall position is admirable, and I agree we should try and accommodate the opinions of others. It really helps when trying to forge compromise. But I\u0027ve thought a lot about this topic as a gay man who\u0027s done research on the evolution of sexual reproduction.
