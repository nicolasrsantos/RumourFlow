Bush\n\n* \"The [PNAC] passage suggested that the transformation of American armed forces through \"new technologies and operational concepts\" was likely to be a long one, \"*absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor.*\"\n\nTo achieve the neocon objectives while still in power, they had to act because of growing resistance to massive and unnecessary increases in military spending by both political opponents and the American people.\n\n\u0026gt; Why did buidling 7 have to be destroyed?\n\nBecause it was a perfect opportunity.  WTC 7 was a treasure trove of evidence that could be eradicated at one shot.  For example, it held the backups of the files concerning the $2.5 trillion lost Pentagon funds - as per Donald Rumsfeld  9-10-2001 - the originals being destroyed in the  Office  of  Naval  Intelligence (ONI),  ground zero of the damage to the Pentagon.\n\nAnd then there\u0027s this gem:\n\n* *\"The hypothesis of this report is: the attacks of September 11th were intended to cover-up the clearing of $240 billion dollars in securities covertly created in September 1991 to fund a covert economic war against the Soviet Union, during which ‘unknown’ western investors bought up much of the Soviet industry, with a focus on oil and gas   The attacks of September 11th also served to derail multiple Federal investigations away from crimes associated with the 1991 covert operation  In doing so, the attacks were justified under the cardinal rule of intelligence: “protect your resources” and consistent with a modus operandi of sacrificing lives for a greater cause.* - from Collateral  Damage:  U.S.  Covert Operations  and  the  Terrorist  Attacks on September 11, 2001\n\nWant to guess where that evidence was stored?\n\n* *\"You never let a serious crisis go to waste. And what I mean by that it\u0027s an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.\"*-Rahm Emanuel (Yeah, I know he\u0027s a Democrat... like that really matters.)","duration":"","id":16,"color":"black","redditID":"t1_cwkhijq","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":14,"links":[13],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Rose-Thorn","label":"This is not a response; it\u0027s a dodge.

That\u0027s dishonest, bad behavior.\n\nThese conspiracy theories do real harm. We should oppose harmful falsehoods.\n\nIf the lesson we learn from 9/11 is \"govt is evil\" or \"the Jews did it\", when the real lesson (I think) is \"we should stop supporting dictators and invading countries\", we risk more 9/11\u0027s. And people in the Mideast don\u0027t learn the lesson \"we should stop the extremists among us\".\n\nIf the lesson we learn from big events (9/11, Boston Bombing, HIV/AIDS, Ebola) is \"don\u0027t trust anything the govt or scientists say\", that helps lead to \"deny climate change, refuse vaccines, deny evolution\".  In places such as Africa, it costs many lives every year.\n\nConspiracy theories generally are a form of religion: belief without evidence, even belief despite the evidence. This harms our country and our society.\n\nAnd the logic of conspiracy theorists often is EXACTLY that of the religious: \"I have no evidence for my claim, but if I can cast doubt on science/govt\u0027s evidence, that means my claim must be correct, right ?\".  No.\n\nYes, there have been real conspiracies. Yes, there is plenty of malice and incompetence by govts or govt agencies.

They could have been craptastic 10 fpm b\u0026amp;w low rez models or some hypothetical 1000 fps full spectrum 4k rez shit available only to the military. But I\u0027m guessing that despite the military\u0027s absurd budget, they spend most of it on fancy war toys, not security cameras.\n\nBut let\u0027s actually look at some basic math. In the official story, flight 77 was traveling at 530mph when it crashed into the Pentagon. That\u0027s 777 feet/sec.\n\n30 fpm camera -\u0026gt; 1554 feet/frame\n\n01 fps camera -\u0026gt; 777 feet/frame\n\n10 fps camera -\u0026gt; 77 feet/frame\n\n15 fps camera -\u0026gt; 51 feet/frame\n\n30 fps camera -\u0026gt; 26 feet/frame\n\nThe shutter speed of the camera is also important. In order to capture such a fast moving object clearly, the cameras would have to have a very fast shutter speed.  \n\nAnd finally the camera placement would have to be such that it covers a long distance. At the point of impact, there\u0027s ~250\u0027 from the road to the building. Depending upon the framerate, the plane could have covered this distance in \u0026lt;1 to 9 images. If the cameras were pointed down at the lawn, flight 77 would have entered their FOV even later.\n\nSo is it plausible that the Pentagon has footage of flight 77? Absolutely.

Operation Northwoods called for [a hijacked plane to be switched with a drone.](http://io9.com/5838778/operation-northwoods-the-1960s-government-plan-to-fake-terrorist-attacks-on-the-us)\n\nThe drone could have been a life-size mockup of Flight 77, loaded with explosives to disintegrate upon impact.  The Pentagon was hit on [the only side that was \"renovated\" and reinforced prior to 9/11](http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/911_pentagon_renovations.html).\n\nIf there was no plane, then why reinforce the only side of the Pentagon that was hit?\n\nThe \"No Plane\" theory was intentional.  Create the appearance that there was no plane, and when the Pentagon is able to prove with videos that there *was* a plane, all of the little Truthers are led by sugar into the Ant Trap.*  No more Truther problem.\n\nIf you don\u0027t believe there was a plane, then you don\u0027t believe in Operation Northwoods either, which called for False Flags with *switched* planes for real hijacked planes.\n\n\"No Plane\" Truthers also must not believe in Norman Mineta\u0027s testimony about Cheney.\n\nIf you withhold evidence of your crime, create a second conspiracy around the real conspiracy, then if you\u0027re busted, the video proof that the second conspiracy was \"nuts\" makes you look innocent.\n\nThe withheld videos are failsafe insurance against Truthers getting too close.","duration":"","id":220,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cwitonm","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Can someone who doesn\u0027t believe in 9/11 conspiracies explain why we haven\u0027t seen footage from these cameras?","label":"gaijinfag","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_3quo5g","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.446248895E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.446268881E9,"simScore":0.7779981085338334,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.446307367E9,"simScore":0.5006934332083078,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},{"index":227,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"criticalcat","label":"And those are just the most obvious ones.
