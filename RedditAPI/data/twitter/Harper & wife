arabia brutal countries world yet we continue business with them human rights than campaign rhetoric dont forget we actively go to war in countries that have little to do with terrorism then turn around and shake the house of sauds hand  we all know who funds those damn cave dwellers but why do anything about it when they line political pockets with oil  there are different factions at work and they literally have unlimited wealthif they ever felt their power was slipping away theyre one of the few countries that could put us into ww with a snap of their fingers  they have enough money and influence to hire every single mercenary in the world and have them attack every major city simultaneously not to mention if they desired to set back russia in retribution for their support of syria or stifle development of american alternate energy sources as well as our own oil projects here in canada  you know generally keep the rest of the world in line they could use that ridiculous wealth to backstop a giant reduction in the price of oil oh um there are not all that many mercenaries in the world maybe one merc for every thousand state soldiers if thatand the majority of those by the way are under contract to the united states and are american they call themselves contractors of course probably because amoral killer makes it hard to pick up down at the tropicana they couldnt attack every city no point in taking a suicide mission if youre a merc and some of them have scruples besides that would be the end for the house of saud doesnt have to be a full on attack  can be something as basic as a fertilizer bomb at a gas station and a firebomb at a government building with a timer or a remote detonatorbasic shit that can be done with enough money or enough insanity yeah but you implied some kind of mercenary army attacking all the cities blowing up a bunch of buildings is completely different and wouldnt actually hurt any countries that much thats assuming they could even pull off some mass terrorism campaign american homeland security isnt that incompetent america and europe would probably just turn around and completely destroy the saudis then install a puppet regime im sorry i didnt account for your imaginationwont let it happen again but do they have nukes  do they have an arsenal in their country  nocan they buy access to nukes  if money can do it yes they dont need nukes since they evidently own the united states of america and they have nukes well i dont know the whole we own you thing doesnt seem to be going to well right now you have another explanantion for why after a bunch of saudis led by a member of the saudi royal family brought down the towers the american answer was to invade iraq so we have one comment of delusional fiction followed up by another that is super racist this is going to be a lovely thread  how is that racist just because i dont like terrorists makes me racist i dont remember saying anything about the people in general all i said was they fund the factions that cause problems for the middle east and that is all there is to it you just took it one step further to make me look like an asshole congratulations you fucked up  you referenced to the country of saudi arabia or the royal family as being cave dwellers gtcongratulations you fucked upyeah totally i mean im the one that made the bigoted comment  no he referenced the royal family funding terrorists who literally lived in caves yeah cave dwellers because they act like ruthless cave men how  is that racist at all you are a spacial kinda stupid arent you do you even understand what these rich fold of arabia fund no well then why dont you educate yourself a little before making wild accusations  if youre going to accuse others of being stupid i might suggest doing it with a coherent sentencealso thank you for indirectly admitting that you were referring to a large group of people who have nothing to do with terrorism as cave dwellers beware saudi arabia and tora bora are exactly the same thingspecial sourcejust because we were involved in the first gulf war  years ago does not mean we actively go to war in countries that have little to do with terrorism first gulf war gtactively go to warthat was  years ago and it was pre so wasnt even under the guise of antiterrorism deleted that word terroreven terrorists back then were just called extremists  the media does amazing things to our culture sure it had nothing to do with terrorism but still we did something to keep the saudi family in charge i agree with the decision to go to the gulf war because the saudi family is a significantly lesser evil than saddamthe middle east is a giant clusterfuck between the different religionsethnicitiesnationalities you cant support one faction without offending another faction because all factions have committed atrocities at some point or another iraq invaded kuwait wtf are you talking about  iraq started firing rockets onto saudi arabia syria backfired in the form of isis that was not a backfire  whenever you have a civil war you have factionsiraq and syria are unstable countries  displaced youth with no options are going to be drawn to groups like thatyou dont want groups like isis to exist  then stop dropping bombs on families  easy solutionif we discovered that an al qaeda leader was attending a wedding in millwoods and we scrambled jets to launch missiles on  ave people would lose their minds but its business as usual if youre not lucky enough to live in a western country we didnt go to syria we are in iraq now to stop isis from committing genocide and because isis started to encourage people to commit acts of terror here however this can backfire because the iraqi government relies on irani backed shia militias who also commit atrocities  what we are not in iraq were in iraq our troops are coordinating airstrikes and they had to return fire when fired upon by isis ahh my mistake but its in a peacekeeping capacity would you agree with the statement that we are actively going to war in iraq because i dont weve gone to war in syria declaring war against a sovereign nation is an outdated conceptwere constantly poking our sticks into hornets nests and then telling everyone how we have the right to defend ourselves once they start to swarm i ahhh think maybe he was refering to the nd war with iraq you know where they had nothing at all to do with  and didnt have wmd amp we went in and killed k people destroying relative peace in the region and setting the stage for isil and stuff maybeedit my bad im a us immigrant who moved to canada over the iraq war and somehow didnt notice i was in rcanada i know  people wont stop going to the pumps and buying gas they insist on doing business with themthe govt is a reflection of the people and sometimes it is a very ugly reflection indeed the government is a reflection of  of people working class canadians dont have much of an alternative to petroleum fuel the  that voted so really its only about  of the canadian people  deleted i was just about the biggest harper pessimistfearmongerer as early as  even i have to admit he has been far worse than i could have possibly imagined  i dunno man pretty sure it would be status quo no matter whos at the helm  petrol is petroledit also the petrodollar  fiat gotta be backed by something right  well now we gotta guard the resource that the us  is based on  cuz they went off the gold standard lol are you kidding me if we would have continued with liberals after  canada would be in a much better place right now just imagine if the usa would have elected al gore in   youre suggesting its the governments fault we drive gasoline powered cars gtworking class canadians dont have much of an alternative to petroleum fueltil that public transit literally does not exist   we get very little of our oil from saudi arabia its the harper government that loves doing business with the saudis  yet canadians see that brutally and still advocate for corporal punishmentthese arent smacks on the ass with a plastic coathanger every single one of these lashes will break the skin  they also dont just allow the victim to pass out from the pain they constantly wake them back up to assure that theyre full conscious and aware for every strikeit makes waterboarding look like trying to teach someone to do the backstroke deleted anytime someone gets sent to prison youll see a bunch of house wives pop up about how they should be tortured beaten and raped deleted they execute less because their country is smallerchina also isnt cutting peoples hands and heads off and publicly whipping them until theyre permanently crippled cant have one without the other you forget the damn free trade agreements were forced on us  for corporation profeteering i dont know how much longer the cozy relationship will last the american electorate is getting very tired of saudi arabia and americansaudi relations is likely going to be a big campaign issue in the presidential primaries israeleveryone relations are souring yet that didnt matter to our government it should be but theyve been buddybuddy for a long time we give them far more economic and political power than they deserve didnt we just agree to an arms deal with them too  not arms just apcs and vehicle parts the saudis have to mount their own weapons on them oh so no more german rheinmetall for them  so what if we did just because we deal with the states doesnt mean that we can justify our actions based on what they do im supporting your point  i know  human suffering is irrelevant when it comes to trade so does the us  do you expect us to halt trade with themshit we also have human rights abuses in this country guess youll leave this country you use the us a benchmark for business ethics hes canadian citizen his wife canadian citizenwhat expect us do his wife and children have sought and received asylum in canada and have the status of refugees this gives canada an important part in all negotiations between the bazawi family and the saudi government did they come to canada and then go back they live to this day still in sherbrooke pq pq an usual abbreviation for province of quebec im retarded i thought it was prince edward quisland or something land of the quotato and of course  anne of queen quables  gt usualnot so usual any more in  the postal abbreviation was changed  ok so im dating myself weird  i had no idea that had changed more than two decades ago  i guess im no better than those fools who still address things ont interesting never heard this before  but it would be better to get some others on board like the us  were not really enough to pressure anyone to do anything be canadians we do have a global image that im sure people at this low point in their lives look towards best we can do is cancel their census and make sure environmental scientists are muzzled  shit even if they both were citizens canada has a pretty consistent record of leaving its citizens out to dry perhaps joining with  other world leaders in a protest against the censorship of free speech by fundamentalists or does that only apply to people who doodle the harpers arent canadian or the bawadis i know right  if theyre not canadian fuck emoh wait thats how americans think  feel free to go live with them if they are not canadian our government owes no responsibility to them and has no right to ask any other country to do anything no responsibility  sure ill agree with that  unfortunately theres these pesky morals that some of us have that consider humans humans regardless where they happened to have been born sorry babe weve big armoured car contract works thats than your husbands life free speech principles are we responsible for every human life on earth then if you live in a country that is so strict on what its people say against it you shouldnt live therenot saying that it we shouldnt try to help but we really cant be blamed for something that isnt our fault nor is it our responsibility we arent the world police if you live in a shithole country dont break their stupid ass rules id rather a policy of if youre a shithole country you dont get arms deals with canada but to each his own i guess but money gt if you live in a shithole country dont break their stupid ass rulesso i guess tyranny should just go on indefinitely imagine if no one in the west ever spoke out against tyranny and oppression we wouldnt be living the lives we have today thats for sure all im saying is after reading the article this situation was definitely avoidable youre right but frankly we have a lot of tyranny in our own backyard to root out im looking at you cse cse our nsa the people spying on you right now and logging everything you do in flagrant breach of the law the greatest threat to our freedom five eyes little helper  north korea still exists so the answer to your question is apparently yes you are right that north korea still exists but our diplomatic relations with north korea is extremely different from saudi arabia north korea has tons of trade embargos against them our government would never think of selling armoured vehicles to them we only denounce brutal dictatorships when there is no money to be madefurthermore north koreans who speak out against their government are usually viewed as very brave people even heroes but if someone speaks out against the saudis i guess theyre stupid and should get whatever is coming to them the way those rules change is when people like nelson mandela stand up to them and becoming a rallying point for change the way canada can help is by putting principles  eg you dont imprison people for speech you dont torture people in custody  ahead of narrow financial interests weve condemned a lot of countries for their human rights records like iran and even china but we always seem to clam up when its an ally like saudi arabia or israel we should at least be consistent its not their fault for being born there instead of here no ones saying canada should take blame merely asking them for help we should make sa responsible for their inhumane acts we live in a country relatively free from bullshit like this and you obviously take that for granted deleted lets start at home and stop pandering to the catholic church yeah why havent you guys abolished the confessional school system  sigh i bring this up all the time basically how pointless useless and how much of a waste of money it is not to mention of course it shows religious favoritism to catholicsi get the same answer every time its in our constitutioncharter of rights or its traditionfuck everyone that uses that as an excuse this problem just gets buried and no politician will ever touch it teacher here  the real reason is none of our politicians have the political will to do something that might piss off a significant  of the voters regardless whether or not its the right thing to do  the only political party who will even bring it up are the greens and no one votes for them because of first past the postour system is very broken you are right but i believe there would be a lot more people in favor of it then there would be angry people once the benefits are outlined in having one school boardi have friends that went to catholic school as well a lot of people on this sub have all said the religion part of the catholic schools is a jokei think the time will come when ontario and saskatchewan will join the rest of the provinces in eliminating it alberta will probably be last since  i believe i may be wrong they include all religious faith schools in getting public funding gt the real reason is none of our politicians have the political will to do something that might piss off a significant  of the voters regardless whether or not its the right thing to doi think theyre far far more scared about opening up the constitution than anything else once anything constitutional is on the table everything constitutional is on the table quebec natives guarenteed rights language laws provincial jurisdiction all of itits pandoras box edit nope im an idiot read here theres no good reason to not get rid of it its almost like we should rotate between parties of different political axis every few years instead of voting or just use a voting system that works like alternative vote or single transferable vote my idea sounds more entertaining maybe we should try it once we have the tech to run largescale lifelike simulations its in canadas constuition to change it would need a super majoirty and the suprem court sweet lets do it it may be hard but it has been done quebec amended it in  and ontario alberta and saskatchewan are the only provinces left that still use the separate school board system no it wouldntthe catholic system in ontario is amendable per s  of the constitution act   only the federal parliament and the provincial legislature would have to approve itsince the federal parliament approves these things as a matter of course it would really be no more difficult than a regular act of the provincial legislature  sighread the canadian constitution section  i ask myself the same question all the time  we pander to all religions here in ontario we only pay for the catholic school board  and we have prayer rooms in public schools now dont get me wrong im not for catholic schools but religion is in all our schools having a space for students to exercise some religious practices isnt the problem having a space an entire school board in fact for a specific religion is the problem religious acceptance should not mean religious favouritism  prayer rooms  thats weird neer saw those growing up  neither did i but trust me theyre here now  its a choice people make in their taxes  if nobody chose to support the catholic called separate school board it would go away thats ridiculous and untrue the catholic schoolboard is deeply entrenched in the constitution its not like you can just legislate it away with a single action i dont think thats actually true from my understanding we specify which board so that well be able to vote for the applicable trustees although im not  on that  i looked around  it certainly seems the catholic schools want you to make that selection  eg  oh okay nice that link actually clarifies things i think many people believe that when you pay your taxes you check a box that actually sends money to one board or the other but this says that it acts as kind of a census  it establishes the level of support for catholic schools it supports the boards population projectionsand then that trustee voting thing i alluded to above  no they did not bury me though there is a period of time which i remember mistily with a shuddering wonder like a passage through some inconceivable world that had no hope in it and no desire i found myself back in the sepulchral city resenting the sight of people hurrying through the streets to filch a little money from each other to devour their infamous cookery to gulp their unwholesome beer to dream their insignificant and silly dreams they trespassed upon my thoughts jconrad we sanction cuba no dude you are so beside the mark its impressive how you go to religion directly when talking about lashes given out in saudi arabia shows just how uninterested you are in whats actually going on why should i be interested in this situation when i can make blanket statements about religion that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt my moral and intellectual superiority over  of the planet go back to rchristianity to dumb neanderthal leterally everyone who believes in god is stupider than mefor the purposes of this comment le refers to the italian feminine plural definite article and not the french singular masculine one because for some reason qubec is bad too also something about bell and rogers  smoke weed erryday this comment made me euphoric really rcanada this is the crap you vote to the top painting all religious people with the same brushdisgraceful nah religion can fuck off can i get you a fedora with that neckbeard fuck off that joke is retarded just because someone looks at the bigger picture and does some fucking research doesnt make them a neckbeard sure go pray or whatever but dont you fucking say that religion doesnt cause a shit load of problems beliefs inform actions wrong beliefs misinform actionsreligions tend to promote beliefs not based on good reason and evidence  so everyone who believes in a god is an idiot and should be disregarded  they should be disregarded if they attempt to use that belief to form public policy thats better everyone who believes in a god has no demonstrably good reason or evidence to support their claims no this is obvious if people had good reasons or evidence for a belief in a god or the supernatural youd never ever hear religious people say you just have to have faith instead people would crack open a science book and point to the chapter describing the nature of whatever deity or pantheon we have good reason to think actually existsbut thats not the point that i was makingwe have models of reality in our heads we build these models based on observations of reality if we allow our models of reality to be based in part on wishful thinking or superstition then we can expect that the decisions we make based on those models to be either inefficient harmful or downright evilthis is why ulegarsdesvues said religions are effectively a force for evil because we wilfully allow this disconnect between our understanding of reality and the way reality really is and really bad stuff can happen as a resulta prime example  the recent case of makayla saultthe reality is is that the current treatments for cancer are the best we have and we know how effective they are statistically speaking if that evidence is ignored in favour of a model of reality that includes faith healing or traditional aboriginal medicine which statistically has not been shown to work then the outcome is what we would expect is it so hard to understand that religion and reason are not mutually exclusive must a christian believe in creationism and claim that evolution is a lie gt is it so hard to understand that religion and reason are not mutually exclusive if someone can present a good reason ie credible compelling evidence to think any supernatural things exist ill happily change my mind gt must a christian believe in creationism and claim that evolution is a liewell generally a christian is someone who accepts jesus christ as their saviour so positions on biology arent really a part of the core christian system of beliefs for people who interpret genesis literally thats a different story there are many good scientists including biologists who are religious a great example is ken millerwho is an excellent molecular and cell biologist biology textbook author and advocate of proper teaching of evolution he happens to be a devout catholicbut miller and religious people like him rely on compartmentalisationthey use science and reason and empiricism in some parts of their lives but when it comes to their religious beliefs they rely on different modes of thinking different standards of evidence and so onproblems arise when the walls between these compartments collapse and two models of reality conflict with one another this is known as cognitive dissonanceand can be incredibly distressing  well im glad you recognize that i dont see anything inherently wrong with compartmentalization seeing as how i also rely on that religious beliefs are obviously not based on fact but in my beliefs im also not arguing against any factual evidence  what good argumentation you should be like a lawyer or somethinghowever my parents are muslim i still havent been flogged yet though hmmm maybe theyre doing it wrongyou seem perfectly knowledgeable and in no way biased so what do you think because i genuinely care about your informed opinionnay not opinion but objective truths gt what good argumentation you should be like a lawyer or somethingthanks this is not my first rodeo gt however my parents are muslim i still havent been flogged yet though hmmm maybe theyre doing it wrongi dont need to tell you that the views beliefs and attitudes among muslims like christians vary wildly religion isnt the sole factor here and culture and history also play a role in determining whether a particular muslim individual is in favour of stoning or the likepew has good stats to back this upfor instance some  of egyptians think that muslims who chose to leave islam should be killed that is not a small numberask your parents what the punishment should be if any for those who decide they no longer believe that allah exists hopefully they would agree that people should be free to find their own path without fear of punishment you havent been flogged yet do you have a blog i have a tumblr no but everyone who reads wrong beliefs misinform actions and hears everyone who believes in god is an idiot and should be disregarded is an idiot and should be disregarded religions are effectively a force for evil religions my son he said religions are effectively a force for evil which given the current state of the levant the arabian peninsula and nigeria might not be an unsupportable claim oh im sorry i now realize his statement wasnt grossly simplistic and most definitely wasnt bigoted at all im glad youve come around but on a less sarcastic note i think its justified to be angry at the use of religion as a political tool after all the bad news lately  i dont think op was saying religious people are inherently evil or anything which i would throw away as bigotry  most of the news i hear in regards to religion paints it as a factor that promotes a sort of tribalism  it must be a school holiday today somewhere  rmetacanada is a stable and welcoming place for all peoples regardless of beliefs metacanada is more of a circlejerk than this sub you dont say at least they acknowledge it just because you are having a self reflexive circlejerk doesnt make it any less pathetic if thats pathetic then i wonder what that makes this sub i dont see anything different over there or good like any power structure isnt canada supposed to be a tolerant country baloneyyou live in a free and tolerant democracy because christian and deist philosophers based the value of the individual on the equality of man in gods eyesread a little john lockechrist separated church and state with render unto god what is gods and unto ceasar what is ceasars indicated tolerance with let he who is without sin cast the first stone and led an exemplary life peacefully preaching a philosophy of loveislam means submission  there is no law but islam  jihad is a responsibility and mohammeds example is one of pillage war mongering genocidal murder enslavement and rape  isis are truly his followersrelativism has no place here  easy kiddo take off your tinfoil hat and realize that if they didnt have religion shitty people would find another reason to justify being shitty i wish we could put a giant bubble over the middle east and let everyone there eventually turn it into a smoldering crater proving they cant get their shit together and run a society including the people trying to make a change andor asking for help how humane of you  they chose to believe in what they do suffer the consequences have you not looked into the history of the middle east and have seen all the outside forces that have shaped it to be what it is today how is that my problem the historical excuse is such a copout answer i guess its my fault for slavery and the holocaust too if you dont care what goes on over there then why are you trying to give retarded ideas to solve the problem you shouldnt of said anything if you dont think its your problem do you even reddit dont turn an argument against  country into an argument against religion  no fuck that this is a religiously motivated action as sanctioned by the state this is absolutely when we start talking about religion there are many countries that practice or used to practice corporal punishment not religiously motivated not muslim this is not a religious issue most certainly not a muslim issue when you are dealing with a country that represents  of the islamic world gt there are many countries that practice or used to practice corporal punishment not religiously motivateddoes this somehow make it ok when it is religiously motivatedcorporal punishment is never ok religion is generally medieval the point is that its missing the pointif corporal punishment exists regardless of religion then its likely that religion serves as a mere justification rather than the actual motivator of why it is therethe saudi regime has used islam to justify their authoritarian policies that are really motivated to crush dissent ask any person who has ever lived in sa and they would tell you that they were scared shitless to protest in any way thats what the real motivator of their government is  maintain their authoritarian control and power islam is just a justificationand yet our western governments have been honoring them for it  gt the point is that its missing the pointif corporal punishment exists regardless of religion then its likely that religion serves as a mere justification rather than the actual motivator of why it is therei see  according to your logic then if bigotry slavery misogeny and violence exist outside of religion we must not blame religion for teaching those things but embrace religion for the good that it does and blame society for the bad things religion espouses im not sure where you read thatim saying we should fight authoritarianism regardless of its form and not distract ourselves with the mere justifications that just disguise the real motivators of these policies  howd you get a spoon that big to put so many words into his mouth at once gt dont turn an argument against  country into an argument against religiondo you want to get this guy released or brag about how your worldview is superior pick one is that supposed to be some kind of dichotomy that i am expected to buy into or are you just being an asshole funny because i was just about to ask you the same thing scapegoating religion when shitty people do shitty things is a terrible way to go about things its being used as a justification to treat people horribly and silence dissent if you think the absence of religion would somehow fix this maybe you should look at joseph stalins track record and try to argue that without religion these people wouldnt be able to find a way to justify all the horrible things they do this isnt scapegoating this is a statesanctioned action against a person because of their action against religious leaders this isnt about shitty people doing shitty things this is the time and place to bring antipathetic discourse to the table  you are absolutely scapegoating religion you speak of it as if diminishing or abolishing religion will make these leaders stop trying to crush dissent that is absolutely positively not the case if all religious practice were to vanish tomorrow these people would still cling to their positions of power with a crushing death grip without religion theyd find new ways to excuse suppressing dissenting thoughtis it good to talk about religion and the ramifications it can have on society why yes it certainly iswill the removal of religion keep corrupt leaders from finding a way to impose their will on the populace absolutely notits irrelevant that religion is the device being used as a smokescreen in this case the real motivation behind this and all oppression is leaders who want to retain their grip on their power gtits irrelevant that religion is the device being used as a smokescreen in this case the real motivation behind this and all oppression is leaders who want to retain their grip on their powerthe truth of the second sentence does not support the first of course the motivation of the oppressors is power but the fact that they can use religion among other things to maintain that power is absolutely relevant diminishing the influence of religion isnt a solution but its progress one less weapon in the hands of the oppressors gt diminishing the influence of religion isnt a solution but its progress one less weapon in the hands of the oppressorsyknow what thats a reasonable argument and i agree with you still i feel that the only action that will ever truly change things over there regardless of the religious climate is some type of hard reaction from the populace which as has been cited in other places in this thread is pretty much terrified into submissionid like to hope theres a solution to the problems that arise from oppressive national leadership in foreign countries but its definitely one i dont have i am absolutely not and politely im not interested in shifting the focus of the conversation with your appeals to extremes i dont care about abolishing all religion or any of the other longwinded rhetoric youve brought into this conversation the only smokescreen here is on your behalf and the behalf on anyone who promotes a lack of action because well there will just be other religions  i dont care about your argument because it shamefully presumes that those antipathetic to this religiously motivated action is simply a naive ideologue who doesnt understand the scope of the issues at play  i was never arguing for a lack of action but since youre more busy politely condescending to my arguments rather than reading deeper into the big picture which you ironically imply im ignoring youve proven at least one of your points to be right this isnt an argument worth having problem is banning it results in even more evil the countries and eras listed here are a whos who and whats what of human sufferingim agnosticwho knowscares better things to concern myself with thats unrelated to the religion or lack thereof all those governments are communist or dictatorial regimes  how do you propose religion could be gotten rid of maybe i am misguided in believing that only elites can tell people what to believe gt problem is banning it results in even more evilatheism doesnt  evil bad people do bad things and evil is as much a societal construct as any other part of religion neuroscientists recently found the brain functions of violent psychopaths is completely different from normal people this isnt evil  its wiringsource for those interestedstate atheism has been used effectively to drive people away from the worship of one deity jeebus and into the arms of another lenin stalin castro etcyou cannot have a successful cult of personalityif you are competing with another god so you remove the god and all those who worship it  effectively making yourself the de facto supreme being see north korea how do you propose religion could be gotten rid of maybe i am misguided in believing that only elites can tell people what to believe gt how do you propose religion could be gotten rid ofby following the bible corinthians   english standard version esv when i was a child i spoke like a child i thought like a child i reasoned like a child when i became a man i gave up childish waysrational adults understand that santa claus is a construct told to children as children grow they let go of believing that santa is realthe same can be done with religion not for any reason of maliciousness or to substitute on insane deity for another yahweh vs stalin etc but because when we grow up we put away childish notions of angels demons gods devils etc years ago they didnt know of things like neuroscience schizophrenia psychopathy and collective obsessional behavior today we domany people and countries are doing fine without religion deleted the catholic church is almost singlehandedly responsible for the aids epidemic in africa theyre not exactly spreading health around the globe and on a related topic for good measure fundamentalist muslims are fighting tooth and nail against the eradication of polio in pakistan  i suggest you watch the finest debate there ever was on that topicits long  hours but its fascinating and it might change your mind it changed most of the audiancestldr  the catholic church is not a force for good dropping a comment so i can come back later and watch this that is what the save function is for finest debate maybe if you go into it already agreeing with fry and hitchens and are super psyched about being on the winning teamthey were entertaining as always but the two people they were up against were a drooling idiot and a shrewbeast who got demolished not a fine debate at all just a stomp half the audiance agreed with him at the start and almost all agreed with him at the end from pre and post surveysso it seems they did a terrific job but i personally liked frys part better thats what i just said you didnt read you just used the disagree button fry and hitchens did very well it was an excellent speech it was not however the finest debate as one side completely obliterated their unprepared and outmatched opponents without any true back and forth im glad youre psyched about your side winning hey i agreed with hitchens and fry toobut it was not by any means a good debate in the same way that a rape is not a really good sexual encounter because the rapist enjoyed it im with you on this  hitchens and fry may as well have been debating against a patch of lichen and a doorstop  im not sure if you watched many debates about religion but thats about as good as the religious side gets no it isnt  stephen colbert for example would have been a great match for fry and the catholic church has many scholars that can put up a better fight than some clueless bishop or politician who was brought up catholic  people study theology for years at the highest level  you want to defeat your opponents at their best not at their most mediocre i have much debate watching under my neckbeard and the performance is quite variable on both sides two prominent and educated people were selected to defend religion and they did their very best to do so youre dismissing a cardinal archbishop who communicated well in spite of his language difficulties and one of the most successful female conservative politicians in british history the room was largely divided at the beginning and by virtue of sound reason and critical deconstruction one side rose prominently with a near concensus of the room yes this was a fine debate the fact that the religious failed to defend themselves adequately is not their fault but the fault of the source of their arguments yes it was a stomp but it was a fine stomp as achieved through diligently structured debate   their credentials and their performance were quite mismatched then not to mention your compliments distil to popular and did okay at basic english if you truly think these two were the best that side had to offer and not just two volunteers in over their heads then by all means believe it i just dont have the faith for that  youre right there was a tremendous mismatch  one side had the cardinal archbishop of the catholic church a man who has managed to be a vocal leader in africa and a man who through judicious study of his religious texts and by playing hard politics won his way to nearly the top of the catholic leadership the other is again one of the most celebrated british conservative politicians in history short of the iron lady shes both an ardent student of religion especially of both anglicanism and catholicism as well as a talented public speaker who can rise people to passion at a moments notice what youre doing is as naive and shameful as reducing hitchens and fry to respectively a writer and a game show personality and politely i really dont care about your faith religious or otherwise the truth is more important  gt and politely i really dont care about your faith religious or otherwise the debate is not even about faith its about the institution that is the catholic church well considering how much money the catholic church makes and how well theyre treated by our government they damn well better spend their money on charities  deleted sorry its not that black and white as much as youd like it to be all religions are at fault for violence and ignorance  the religions are or the people following those religions flawed logic a religion doesnt exist except in the mind of its followers so there is no duality as you suggestif you hit someone with your car are you at fault or is the car without both parts there is no incident  the thing is that you need to separate the two in your mind as an observer because the moment you close your heart to that person you close your heart to change if i cl you a murderer for having killed someone in cold blood i am wrong you are not a murderer you are someone who has murdered this leaves room for society and me to accept you again and that is showing compassion i know ill be in the minority here but you do need to separate the person from their actions  i didnt understand most of your post sorry gt you do need to separate the person from their actionsim not sure if this is just a languagecommunication issue because this isnt true at all i judge a person based on their actions and words skin colouroriginethnicity are irrelevant to me is that what you meant to suggest sort of but what im saying is realize that judging based on actions tends to lead you to identify that person with that action like i said murdering is bad but to associate jim who murdered as a murderer isnt the best thing in the world to do because what if he changes its a little hard to accept with something big like that but lets use lying say cathy is a serial liar to call her that isnt good call her a person who can continuously lied this leaves room for change when you associate something directly with their actions then you dont give them a chance at redemption in your eyes or societys  definitely the religions people need ideological excuses to do fucked up things blaming the people is what leads into antisemitism antimuslim attitudes and other forms of bigotry the problem is most definitely the ideology of religion which deserves to be subject to harsh critique in the same way every other ideology should be deleted wow talk about a no true scotsman ehthe bible and the koran both tell the same lies and they both require followers to convert others by force or to kill unbelieverschristians dont love their neighbors they hate gays muslims and atheists and they cite the bible just like you do because its nothing but cherry picked ideas translated and retranslated a dozen times over to suite whoemever held power see king jamesmohammad told his followers to help and love christians so your same logic applies equally to muslim extremists as this point im assuming youre trolling  and that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death because he hath spoken to turn you away from the lord your god which brought you out of the land of egypt and redeemed you out of the house of bondage to thrust thee out of the way which the lord thy god commanded thee to walk in so shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee deuteronomy  if thy brother the son of thy mother or thy son or thy daughter or the wife of thy bosom or thy friend which is as thine own soul entice thee secretly saying let us go and serve other gods which thou hast not known thou nor thy fathersnamely of the gods of the people which are round about you nigh unto thee or far off from thee from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earththou shalt not consent unto him nor hearken unto him neither shall thine eye pity him neither shalt thou spare neither shalt thou conceal himbut thou shalt surely kill him thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death and afterwards the hand of all the peopleand thou shalt stone him with stones that he die because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the lord thy god which brought thee out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage deuteronomy   certain men the children of belial are gone out from among you and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city saying let us go and serve other gods which ye have not knownthen shalt thou enquire and make search and ask diligently and behold if it be truth and the thing certain that such abomination is wrought among youthou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword destroying it utterly and all that is therein and the cattle thereof with the edge of the swordand thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the

that time and utterly destroyed the men and the women and the little ones of every city we left none to remain deuteronomy    thanks for looking those up something tells me that ucnac wont be swayed im assuming he is a troll i am with you after the second paragraph but your first two are too sweeping id like to point out that indonesia bangladesh azerbaijan uzbekistan and turkey are all predominantly muslim countries in fact there are many moremuslim countries than there are muslim countries that the west associates with terror activity islam is not the root cause of this activity an oppressive government and desperate poor population isi see you have formulated a no true scotsman argument in your reply to usafetyjam below so i must ask if you think children should be punished when their parents fail to circumcise them or if a father can sell his daughter to settle a debt or hell why not confront your matthew  with a direct contradiction in leviticus  anyone who takes the life of a human being is to be put to death  anyone who takes the life of someones animal must make restitutionlife for life  anyone who injures their neighbor is to be injured in the same manner  fracture for fracture eye for eye tooth for tooth the one who has inflicted the injury must suffer the same injury  whoever kills an animal must make restitution but whoever kills a human being is to be put to death  you are to have the same law for the foreigner and the nativeborn i am the lord your godif you dont follow these you are doing so contrary to christian teachings look i am not trying to bash christianity here my point is that no one is a perfectly orthodox follower of their ancient dogma religions have plenty of dissonance with modern morality because they are just too old so people and indeed cultures adhere to the parts of the ancient dogma that they still find relevant no two muslims really have the same religion no two people have the same religion it is all a matter of interpretation and desperate people are willing to accept interpretations that preach harming others because some powerful organization promises them a better life or afterlife deleted i hope youll forgive me for posting a source riddled with atheist vocabulary and bias but would you say you subscribe to the ideologies presented in these new testament passagesagain my point isnt to disprove the religion its rather to show that peoples personal moral codes are never onetoone wih their religionsand for what its worth i do find the philosophy of turning the other cheek to be a beautiful one and it is one i subscribe to deleted yeah the writer is antagonistic but your defense is exactly my point religion is subtle intuituve and ones interpretation of it is shaped by personal experience and cultural context no one takes it at face value which is why i have so much of a problem with people claiming that a particular religon most recently islam preaches a hateful agenda people are predisposed to interpreting the koran this way in a small but impactful subset of islamic countries it is fallacious and worse unconstructive to pin blame on the religion itself deleted saudi arabia represents about  of muslims saudi toughoncrime slogan if you take flogging blogging dude better copyright that quick  sauds will have no choice but to pay you three sacs of gold for it i created a meme versionover at radviceanimals that will have to serve as my proof of creatorship yes we sell saudis kinds military vehicles we tell them what do ditto china now if husband flogged isis then we drop bombs we fight forces darkenss selectively perhaps we build garish monument point i mean i dislike the conservative government as much as the next guy but youre just being disingenuous from the articlegtforeign affairs minister john baird development minister christian paradis and andrew bennett canadas ambassador for religious freedom have all issued statements condemning badawis sentenceim pretty sure issuing statements condemning badawis sentence roughly equates to the idea of telling them what to do at least as far as is possible sovereignty and all that  didnt our government just praise the saudis for their humanitarian workfuck the conservatives  so lets criticize them for that go to town i dont get how that relates to the fact that the government in this specific circumstance behaved perfectly appropriately given international norms  right words any actionlike were not going to sell you military equipment until you respect universal human rights embargoes anything like thatno becuse the harper governemnt will talk the talk but when it comes to the walk well no we wont do that   no i often support what you say but this time youre way off sovereignty means a state has exclusive jurisdiction over domestic issues as much as i think the guys situation sucks  and i dont think its fair either id like to see him released too  another state has no business employing sanctions for foreign domestic issues the most they are allowed to do  because of sovereignty  is express dissatisfaction to urge them to stop this is different from for example the ukrainerussia issue because that was an international issue where this is a domestic saudi issue  i believe the people of south africa would have much to say about the subject of how much the international community can help bring about change via sanctions and embargoes and the like first of all in your first post you said that they need to tell them what to do and i told you they did now youre telling me yeah they told them what to do but they didnt act way to move the goalposts there grunty second even though the us and other western states participated in dissinvestment in south africa which may have sped up the dismantling of apartheid does not mean it was a legal international maneuver it wasnt  telling someone to do something in such a way that if they ignore there will be no consequences as is the case here isnt really telling anyone to do anything as for sanctions and embargoes being illegal youll need to walk me through that first ive ever heard  i didnt say sanctions and embargoes were illegal i said imposing sanctions for foreign domestic issues spits in the face of the concept of sovereignty which is probably the most important concept in international relationsgtsovereignty in laymans terms means a state or a governing body has the full right and power to govern itself without any interference from outside sources or bodies in political theory sovereignty is a substantive term designating supreme authority over some polity it is a basic principle underlying the dominant westphalian model of state foundationlink no im pretty sure stop torturing your citizens or well stop trading with you is not a violation of sovereignty  edit sorry that was rude im not debating this any more believe what you will if ugruntbuggle is disingenuous youre nave please explain tell me why you think so  because you believe empty rhetoric from the governmentcondemning statements wow how effective we should do that with isis s i dont believe in empty rhetoric from government i accept the states limitations in actions with regards to foreign domestic issues on the world stage edit removed my edit for a more appropriate onesometimes the government has limitations sometimes bad things the conservatives do they do because they have no other choice it isnt right to criticize them for this it is beyond their control even if we had a liberal ndp or any other government the government would not act beyond this given the circumstances of the issue they just wouldnt  i thought saudi flogging embarrass people look at all those shitheels screaming for blood what a terrible place i defense of those guys when people are disliked accused of wrongdoing or convicted of wrongdoing over here there are lots of others screaming for terrible punishments though i notice in uscanada its a preference for being sexually assaulted in jail or executed in a painful way oh wow i assumed that it was a full on brutal flogging im sure that that probably stings but i cant see it being dangerous unless he is already very hurt or ill it could probably cause welts and draw blood and something tells me saudi prisons arent clean enough to prevent infections  it is which is why this is a nonstory  ive paid good money to be flogged harder and for longer than this pussy you like that dont you maybe u should go middle east and insult the prophet in public  then your dreams will be fulfilled why dont you take his place then and spend your life in jail enjoying your flogging people canada we expect them respect canadian law if canadians travel saudi arabia they respect saudi laws while there no matter insane barbaric its their laws going country you subject yourself them yes its barbaric yes its medieval when you travel there you implicitly agree subject their rules did you read the article raif badawi is himself a saudi this isnt about a canadian who travelled there his wife is in canada as a refugee  shes not canadian eitherwhat people are asking is for mr harper to put pressure on the saudi government to live up to their signature on the un convention banning torture gtwhat people are asking is for mr harper to put pressure on the saudi government to live up to their signature on the un convention banning torturesaudi arabia is sovereign nation i hate them i refuse to do business with them and i would like canada to sever ties with them we have more than enough oil to be selfsufficient as a country but they are still a sovereign country with their own laws ill admit i skimmed the article however if he was here as a refugee from saudi arabia and he voluntarily went back to be an agitator should we not then take that as a sign that perhaps his refugee claim was not well founded i would go so far as to say that we should revoke his status altogether and not let him back into the country  holy shit read the article  or even my comment he was never in canada as a refugee he never submitted a claim its his wife who is here as a refugee youre voicing an opinion on something that didnt happen i am chastised and guilty of high crimes against reddit id delete my post to hide my shame but only cowards do that  he was never in canada will someone gods sake link blog i trust until i half story is there anything he could have possibly written in that blog that would justify what is happening to him  no i cant answer that until i see the blog but this article is incomplete without explaining exactly what he did  his misdeed admitting on facebook that he is an atheist a supporter of womens rights and saying the combination of the sword and the quran are more dangerous than a nuclear bomb holy shit what could he have said that deserved  years and  lashes  no idea which is why i want to see this blog dont waste your time the principles of critical thinking are lost in this sub it sure looks that way  youre insane if you actually think that any blog posting at all could be worth that level of punishment he should consider himself lucky alot of countries in that region would consider beheading for that kind of insult people die for a lot less there how about you eat a dick you should look at things from as many different angles as you can its called critical thinking no matter what you are readingobservinghearing dont come to a conclusion until you have seen all the pieces of the puzzle have a wonderful afternoon  but by your logic there is something that he could have written that would warrant the punishment  what kind of blog entry do you think would warrant  lashes and  years it you applied critical thinking at all youd realise that there is literally nothing that anyone could say that would warrant such a terribly horrific punishment fucking lashes  being whipped weekly for  years  i can think of few crimes short of genocide that deserve this level of punishmentbut yeah maybe he called your mom fat or something and he deserves it who are you  stephen harpers son  go fuck yourself you fat turkey gti cant trust anything until i see the other half of the story really really  same thing with the gulags in north korea you would need to know what those peoples crimes were before you could trust that their punishment by the state was justified youre all kinds of fucked up bro  thats absolutely correct apparently in this day and age its fucked up to question whats going on around you and not accepting things on first glance enough of me and what i think this thread is about reaf  gtthats absolutely correctyikes just imagine for a second if you were a wwii soldier who discovered one of the concentration camps literally your reaction would be wait wait we cant let these prisoners out we have to hear the other side of the story from the nazisyoure fucked up bro theres no other way to put it  you have more than enough but here is more  i tried looking through it for info but there is just too much stuff i dont know what to believe either it states that he was criticizing high ranking officials in the wiki though but he has been doing it for years he was  first detained on apostasy charges in  and there were more incidents that followed iunno man i dont know enough to comment but i linked the wikipedia page if you want to check it out i couldnt find the original blog in my  mins of looking around gt detained on apostasy chargesthats some bullshit right therearrested for not being the right religion  yup full of selfconfidence yeah i know but i dont know enough about saudi arabia to comment further i linked the article above if you want to check it out you gave it a go and thats all that matters what are you expecting or hoping to see in the blog the content of the blog is irrelevant  ive read lot fiction nonfiction napoleonic era the descriptions what flogging people brutal barbaric actually worse than barbaric inhuman  this un problem canada problem go un complain august body wrong doings saudi arabia lady  we shit what we  a

thousands north korean political prisoners suffering x than privledged blogger hipster wife yeah you living shit country with shit rules deal with it dont expect canada save you your countries customs there way things deal withwho fuck upvotes clickbait shit gtthere are thousands of north korean political prisoners suffering x moreright so they should probablygtyeah if you dont like living in a shit country with shit rules deal with itwell shit  if those north koreans didnt like living in north korea they should just deal with it right im saying they are fucked and it isnt our job to save them im saying that that applies equally to north koreans as it does to saudis or anybody else so why bring up the north korean prisoners in the first place if you believe its not our job to save people from their abusive governments oh oh i know the answerits because he doesnt give a shit about anything except when he can use one cause to trivialize the other  im just making the point that if we were to become team canada world police we would have bigger issues to deal with than some blogger getting whipped a few times a day deleted im not sure how you went from pitying this guy for his impending flogging to no muslim immigrants plz if you want whipped saudi arabia seems simple enough and what do you suggest for people who are born there seems so simple coming from a privileged

they going chinese mining venture sounds tax loss sellingwhich usually takes place yearend you dont dump your entire portfolio for this why not  do you know what her portfolio consisted of  she sold the portfolio at year end which indicates likely tax loss selling  if you want to put on a tin foil hat be my guest  i assume she is a rational welleducated investor who would not have a portfolio that looks shabby enough to require a complete sell off in such a manner it is an assumption but likely a good one gti assumein other words you dont have a bloody clue sounds like  neither do you bro that is equivalent to an assumption back off yeah but im not wearing a tin foil hat and extrapolating what laureens stock portfolio consists of  take it to rconspiracyjust checked youre a hobbyist junior investor  everything is now explained i dont need to check your comment history to infer anything about you your original comment clearly shows you are a layperson in the realm of investments and finance i have spent years educating myself on this hobby i also have a nontrivial number of assets under my own managementalso you were the one who brought the tax loss selling up the onus is on you to explain under what situations tax loss selling would encompass an entire portfolio sell off  not for me to explain why it would not see if you can put together something yourself i dont want any investopedia ctrlcctrlvs here observeyou post you want ideas whatsoever but when you comment with laureen preparing leave husband tory slime machine downvotes oblivionmakes thing were something tory slime machine downvotes to obliviontory shillwhat is this rpolitics  i dont think theyve had tories in the states since the mid th century i mean the fact that youre talking about a tory slime machine downvotes and some other guy is talking about a tory shillits pathetic getting downvoted hurr its the tories following me on the interwebs to downvote the truthrpolitics has a similar level of quality  except that the cpc admitted to doing it and further seeing as they dont do much background research on their membership sent me instructions on how to do it as well  i am not a conservative big or little c im actually probably more leftleaning than you are but i downvoted a lot of these comments because they area baseless rumours andb meanjust because you dont like someones politics or other beliefs does not give you the right to be an ass towards them this is a huge problem in the political sphere  many people hate belittle or ridicule those they dont agree with simply because they assume someone who holds different opinions or beliefs is a bad person this attitude is far more damaging both to individuals and to the country than healthy disagreement over real issues i realise that showing respect is no longer a popular concept but it is an essential part of a civil society all thats fine and well but theres a war on for the soul of this country our current government has used a variety of tactics to force an uncanadian approach to our political discourse and how we present ourselves to the world im sick of it a lot of nice normal people are sick of it our government seems to spend far far more time attacking its opponents as well as running a documented fraud campaign against the canadian voting public robocalls attack ads mps cursing out other mps missing documents lies damned lies not to mention the documented cases in which they employ their resources to steer the conversation towards making the cpcs extremist social conservative position the new normal its pathetic its low and its working the cpc employs gop styled strategies to bury the inconvenient issues of the day its easier to call your opponent a commie a socialist naive whatever than to actually figure out a solution for the greater good for christs sake they only send stimulus funding to ridings they either currently hold of those they have a strong chance of winning the next time around they are the least transparent government weve ever had and theyre hostile to criticism of any kind remember youre either with us or the pedophiles id like to see the political discourse rise back up to a respectable level but for the moment this is where some people boot vent their fully understandable frustrations so be it and let it be better someone vent and feel good when up voted than bottle it up and lash out in a more violent way our society is stressed the fuck out and much of our stress comes principally not from our own actions or lack thereof but from whatever else is outside our control happening down south or around the world but instead of us still being the goodguys seeking the greater good at home and working towards the betterment of the world were increasingly becoming the mr burns of the socalled civilized world let people kvetch it has little effect on you and dont forget more often than not the tories here are bonafide shills people so disconnected from whats good and right do form a strict minority in our society were still quite good for the most part  i know a tory shill that actually calls himself silver slimer lol  ha doesnt surprise me subtlety is not their fort i honestly care this newsworthy deleted why should we care what a politicians family does if it doesnt effect their ability to do their job insider trading would have the ability to effect the whole country so shes financially independent husband spends lot time with female rcmp bodyguard retains residence under assumed chateau lauriersounds marriage rocks perhaps shes born christian hed like person who deliver photograph laureen rcmp officer chateau laurier im surprised investments arent held blind trust seriously wtf is wrong with me agreeing with you

whatever issues i with husband i commend zombieoriented planning acquisitions thanks downvotes cuntservatives d deleted is this just your own personal speculation or has there been evidence of marital problems mrsharper being a closeted lesbian is a rumor that has been going around the gay community for years  when is ths idiotic rumor going to die there was a rumour going around this time last year when you hear it its pretty unbelievable  harper divorce but staying together for appearances  ms harper is a lesbian and has taken up a suite at the chateau laurier with her new rcmp girlfriend and bodyguard  yep thats it heard that from several people in the pmo another few in dfait and half the citizens of ottawa  deleted haha fair enoughim not much of a harper fan but i dont wish the heartache and messiness of divorce on anyone  rumor has it that shes shacking up with a female rcmp officer and she rides a motorcycle just sayin this is a blog post referring to a couple of articles that have been deleted i dont think it qualifies as any sort of evidence at all this has been rumoured for many years not that any of it matters really they both deserve a happy life together or apart environmental bloggers who cant see anything right with stephen harper and believe the majority of his caucus is extremely right wing there is someone with major insights to his marriage and wifes personal life  soif a woman likes motorcycles shes a lesbian not likes rides still stereotyping lesbians bigot and we have the correct responsetory shill squad downvoted the right answer to oblivion i didnt downvote that shit  does extremely irresponsible were free what we want with what we have but yelling fire crowded theatre people are free to do what they want with their moneyher and harper are getting older most people should move more of their investments out of stocks as they get closer to retirement  i have no idea if this is whats happening here and i just dont see why anyone would care you grossly overestimate the power of an individual on the market hilariously uninformed comment it isnt just one person simply selling their portfolio though it is a person who has deep access to previously unknown information about what the government is planningto be clear i do not think that she is likely doing this because of this knowledge but simply wanting to sell it can however seem different to other people i am a hobbyist junior investor this may seem scary wrong or whatever to a lay person that does not matter they are lay people who know next to nothing within this context anyone with any knowledge of finance and investing knows this is a complete nonissue it is hilarious that one would think so i am not up to date on the canadian laws regarding insider trading but in the us elected officials are exempted on sec fines and lawsuits regarding insider trading due to the nature of their positions as a result of this you can read many articles in which traders have very successful portfolios by mimicking the movements of a member of congress or the senate if they have access to that data getting to my point now  mimicking a politicians portfolio movements may prove to be a useful strategy but following their complete portfolio dump out of equities means absolutely nothing this is not a useful datapoint if you inferred that she had insider information that she is working on that says the markets are going to take a huge dive there are faaaaar more profitable approaches to such a scenario than dumping everything look up shortselling options trading and other financial derivatives markets to learn more about these as i said i dont think it is an issue but i can see why some people might get the wrong idea from it that being said i personally think that

the whole point there keep up awareness keep up morale bring volunteers community nothing wrong with what shes doing ive spent the last few days wondering how differently the perceptions would be if any other party was there i can imagine some pretty fierce outrage if say trudeau his family and a select group of liberal mps were out in force making a media event of their contributions you can guarantee that they would be criticized for attempting to score political points off of a natural disaster and only there for personal gain as opposed to actually helping yet doing the exact same thing seems to be almost expected from the standing government which i can also understand gtive spent the last few days wondering how differently the perceptions would be if any other party was there i can imagine some pretty fierce outrage if say trudeau his family and a select group of liberal mps were out in force making a media event of their contributions well know soon enough to be fair the article states that her father lives in an affected area she doesnt need any ulterior political motive to be helping out although no doubt she doesnt object to the positive publicity it brings her family and her partywhereas if trudeau showed up it would seem much more likely to be primarily a political publicity stunt because afaik he has no family or friends in the area he identifies primarily as a quebecker and by extension is presumed to hate alberta and all its inhabitants   although really i dislike that level of cynicism regardless of party  i mean how can any politician win in that sort of situation  if they help out they are exploiting the situation for political gain but if they dont they are cold and uncaring aloof from the disaster sometimes perhaps its enough to be glad they are doing the right thing and let them worry about their motives i agree and have previously said i am glad she is becoming more active in societythe optics of her new public persona i think are what many question where has she been since  why now is her new role to make harper and by the extension the government softer and more caring is her being in the spotlight to take some away from the current scandalsi think those among others are fair questions to ask because up until very recently we rarely saw and even more rarely heard her now she appears to be going all us first lady again i think its great its  more person doing good publicly i do wonder why though  shes been fairly active with a variety of fundraisers and charities since  she often attends events that require the attendance of the pm when he cant make it yes thats right most notably being in attendance at the charity event where justin stripped downsorry i guess didnt explain it well enough what i meant was is it being reported now why is she only now getting a public persona ive seen a bunch of stories very recently about her charity work etc where as a couple years ago or even  months ago you only knew about what she was doing if she was right in front of youlike i said im glad its becoming more public maybe there is no ulterior motive and she just wanted to stay in back because she was shy and now shes decided she wants a bigger presence thats cool up until very recently very very little that occurred within or around the cpc was offscript its just recently that a growing number of players seem to be getting fed up with their lines or the writers the pmo have just been getting sloppy even if this isnt actually the case it is the publicly perceived and accepted narrative of the cpc and the cpc has done next to nothing to try and correct this if it isnt the case so when laureen all of a sudden appears to be actively getting the attention of the public people immediately wonder why now  the reason we dont see it more than in the us is because were more reasonable about our elected officials  focus on the damned elected official not their familyhell chretiens son was in jail and we barely heard about it yet when reagans daughter posed for playboy people lost their shit oh absolutely i think we can maintain our reasonableness while encouraging positive press though it can be helpful in that it creates a different way for people to connect to governmentdemocracy the pms wife is not an elected official shes not attached to a political party shes not a politican but close enough that if you pay attention to her youll have an idea of what the government is doing the best example is the uss first lady people who dont like government or politicans can still be involved through her  interestingly enough thats sort of the whole point of the royal family and the governors so its interesting to see the pm and his wife trying to move into this area with this disaster we cant really fly the royal family here for this and our current batch of governors just isnt suited for this kind of thing somewhat intentionally id suspect i think id be fine with the various governors and their families being a little active im not sure if there is a lot of appeal for it though would be interesting to see for sure roger clinton good her its great taking advantage photoop that deleted  reports in  minutes  i think thats a record suffice it to say that if this is what you would consider to count as trying to stay classy your time in this subreddit will be shortlived

forces dominant powers pern try cooperate suddenly start things wanted you robinton recruiting females hall playing political games with elsebut silly theorycrafting very supported books tenuous connectionsi frankly think its dumb mhop basically invalidated menollys entire story merelan was harper formal title way written mhop the editors totally fell job pointing mccaffrey rewriting bits that i think that we can also take the isolation of halfcircle sea hold into account petiron probably never corrected it openly because not only would yanus not be convinced but then petiron would have lost all ethos with the locals of course as we know before he died petiron was trying to reach out to robinton on menollys behalf  i dont know  it doesnt make sense that petiron wouldnt let robinton know the name of the apprentice  undoubtedly robinton asked and didnt get an answer maybe because he wasnt told or maybe because it was truly all so late that by the time robintons letter made it there petiron was already gone  but petirons behavior strikes me as well the music is written already so let the hall use it but dont promise the girl something she cant haveor even since his mind seemed to be going at the end maybe he thought he was back at the hall and sort of followed old patterns of behavior regardless of how he felt about menollys prospects as a harperor maybe he just wanted a young harper to be sent so menolly could marry him and thought curiosity might lure one of the halls better musicians there theres point masterharper pern where newlypromoted master robinton deliberately searching females bring harper hallhe asks maizella halanna finish training i remember correctly i think there period time where there ton female harpers coupled with fax dominating holds and misogynist coupled with general misinformation remember sea holder yanus want menolly harper all would told stoppetiron married mastersinger yes merelan thata singer she elevated status prowess i think general harper terms journeymans level teach basic classes posted officially harper in fact taught very young petiron want it i think official duty anythingpetiron wouldnt thought wife harper hed thought singer that what hall why place on top that yanuss opinion female harpers and while taught menolly secret wish false hope leave holdthis place i wrong points meh thoughts merelan was mastersinger in mhop she also sang on a level that might be equivalent to a classicallytrained opera singer my theory taking canon into effect and running with it is as so regurgitate fax theory mennolys father interfered and disapproved halfcircle was extremely isolated that they barely got a dragonrider checkin after a bad fall and then add in the fact that petiron was old near  if i remember right his mind probably wasnt all it used to be plus he himself had hideward thinking and had been a hideboundthinking individual for over  years  plus he thought of menolly as being under his protection and he wasnt about to send her more than halfway across pern without some sort of protection and yanus definitely wasnt going along with that his letter to robinton spoke of trouble surrounding this new apprentice as petiron never gave a gender my thinking was that menollys gender didnt matter to petiron the issue of yanus needed to be dealt with gently and petiron died before he could talk it outyeah scattered thoughts but i did just switch mental language to read this might edit tomorrow once im thinking in english again i think youre on to something and yanus is definitely the sticking point there would be no way that petiron wouldnt trust robinton to take care of menolly in the hall but the issue would be getting menolly out of the hold yanus ran a fairly tight hold and kept track of everything so menolly wouldnt be able to go illegally missing for long the only reason she managed to run away in the first place was because of threadfall and the dragonrider picking her uptherefore petiron would have needed yanuss permission to send menolly away and given yanuss attitude towards harpers and female harpers in general knew he needed more assistance there was no reason to give menolly a false hope when petiron himself hadnt yet secured her departure plus theres fax and his huge sphere of influence without a dragonrider pair to get menolly to the harper hall she would have to go the long way  by ship or wagon  yanus would never lend a ship out to get her to fort hold harbor which is described as several hours travel away from fort hold even in dragonsdawn neither would yanus send guards with his nearlyestranged daughter  she was a woman a resident of his seahold and however else he may have felt about her his daughter  she was useful to him there for the express purpose of tending to the elderly familya simple drudge would not be high enough in status to take care of yanus elderly family and to his thinking useful to no one else due to her extreme and allencompassing musicality  a useless thing in a woman to his thinkingso with no guards and no ship and the traders not stopping at halfcircleimplied not even yearly and even then theyd have to travel to another hold to get trade goods the only thing left would be to have harper hall send a dragonrider pair to pick her up which is tricky to manage crossweyr like thatbenden for halfcircle fort for harper hall and would require the authorisation and allowance of the masterharper and yanus it would have taken months to hash out at letter speed even with the runner hall expressrunning the letterspetiron didnt have the time sadly i find this explanation very emotionally satisfying perhaps petiron didnt tell menolly about women in the hall because he never talked about his personal life menolly didnt know about robinton for example he didnt want to give false hope before another harper was in the hold to try and change the situation he didnt have the skills to change mindsets  in mhop he misses things completely about his own wife and sonin the absence of information menolly assumed what others at the hold assumed women couldnt be harpers  several books note odd women crafts reckon with decline harper hall weyrs i thought they female singers harper taught play instruments drum signals instruments write music they rank responsibility teach young frequently called upon travel provide diplomatic services i think female singers merelan accorded status harpers merelan status than married petiron i thought that was a potential explanation but merelan also taught the young and could be posted in different holds shes also called a mastersinger not just a singer finally theres a line in masterharper where robinton remarks on being surprised that there was another craft which valued women as much as the harper hall did i thought merelan was only posted in different holds because she was going with petiron and that she did a lot of the teaching just because petiron did not want to do it as ujessipirate suggested i also agree with uzwidomini that mhop seems to be quite a bit of revisionist history the world of dragonflight and dragonsong seems very different than mhop or i guess one could argue that pernese society took a huge step back especially in terms of how women were viewed during the last interval and especially during faxs reign i guess harper hall could have been a bit different too since communication was much more limited between the holds and crafthalls without the fire lizards and when the weyrs kept more to themselves merelan took a posting at benden hold without petiron when they began seriously arguing over robinton now that may have been a special case because of the situation but merelan mentions that gennell  had been asking her to take this position for some time ah good memory i really cant explain it except that perhaps anne didnt want to write gennell as a bad guy i do remember silvina being confused when menolly mentioned that petiron had told her girls couldnt be harpers she even said something like maybe under another masterharper but surely petiron knew his own son wouldnt be like that i dont have the book right in front of me for access but im pretty sure thats in dragonsinger i recall menollys dad asshole perhaps deliberate disinformation this easy one a masterharper mucisian masterharper teacherprofessormediator a mastersinger good singer because its full plot holes im rereading pern series couple decades basically grownup dumb  yeeeesh i hated

special allbat family team mission that would cool i second this i especially needs me more tim drake for sure yeah i dont want them to go into jason todds death extensively but i want to be able to see more visible effects as to how it affected bat and sons i want members join team its going happen i remember mentioned they third season there would time skipi honestly feel we missed two years its kinda disappointing five i wait inevitable shit storm nightwing megan secret aqua lad i wait ensuing shit storm super boy megan you tell what did but megan mind wiped aqualad how will that affect the mission how will the guilt affect megan  im hoping this stunt makes her realize what shes done and that superboy will be the one to really hit her e with that fact and even better itd be nice if she learned how to reverse it as much of a cop out as it seems also with him incapacitated how will that affect the mission hard to get intel when your mole is brain dead  a good point but he did caldur did see all the members of the light and im sure megan got a hefty dose of their faces the mole work may have paid off in the long run i really cant wait to see how nightwing deals with everything hes the middleman and everything will converge on him soon the fallout between nightwing and wally will be awesome artemis is trapped she could leave but she wont leave kaldur behind she doesnt have her bow either and there wont be any help outside of nightwing wally and mgann unless nightwing decides to reveal his plan to the league and the team whos going to stand by nightwing after they find out what he has done anyone think jason todd back snap brainwashing hell join arsenal tagteam antihero campaign the light i just creamed yes please i wanna darkseid some missions space

again  but still i want to see wally take up the mantle of the flash at some point d oh yeah i totally do too especially since he doesnt even exist anymore in the comics a little bit off topic from

holy shit hes bragging about being published in the sun that fucking hilarious i mean sun garbage tabloid trash im pretty british fox news viewers treat with disdain hey hey hey he was published along with other great literary works like the page three girl didnt they have a campaign to pull page three girls already are still going there was a bunch of news coverage about how theyd pulled the page three girl because there hadnt been one for a few issuesother news agencies wrote about this because it was so exemplary that it had been gonethen the sun clarified it with a really rude page three girl the following weekit was depressing because other people noticed and kinda went oh i guess they got nice but then they were like nah were still awful lol iirc all the outlets that reported on it were owned by the same parent company so it was just a publicity stunt tbf they havent published a page  girl since then so i think it might have died but it seems they didnt want to get rid of it without demonstrating just how shitty they can be the sun is owned by rupert murdoch so its kind of like saying hey fox news treats me seriouslyis it a right wing paperyes of course it is isnt that like bragging about being published in the national enquirer well the sun is the most read newspaper in the uk sure that says more about the uk than it does about the quality of the sun but its certainly not a fringe publication gtwell the sun is the most read newspaper in the uknot in liverpool it isnt p are you sure that read is the right word wont make a blip on the paper considering the people who actually like the sun are too busy being angry at the mangy scots gits ed milliband potentially being pm as of writing neck and neck between labour and the conservatives and the people who actually hate the sun have already thrown their bile at katie hopkins whos like british ann coulter if youre wondering gt british ann coultertmilooks for brain bleach the sun is terrible in other countries too ahahahahaha thats amazingltcanadian the sunsunmedia here is basically a tabloid that features real news and its awful and yet i dont think theres some international conglomerate called the sun go figure i kind of want to start using that now ggs evidence of collusion is about as circumstantial as thinking that the sun media groups are all working together because they happen to suck in the same way their ridiculously dumb gotchafront page published during the falklands war is often used as a prime example of yellow journalism you might get a kick out of this the sun is a mass of incandescent gas  a gigantic nuclear furnace  where hydrogen is built into helium  at a temperature of millions of degreesthe sun is hotit is so hot that everything on it is a gas iron copper aluminum and many othersthe sun is largeif the sun were hollow a million earths could fit inside and yet the sun is only a middlesized starthe sun is far awayabout  million miles away and thats why it looks so small sol is a tabloid i see the light we need its light  we need its heat  we need its energy  without the sun without a doubt  thered be no you and me they might be giants fuck yeah  no no no no the vancouver sun is unaffiliated with sunmedia and is the liberal paper in bc so at least theres that ohhh right i forgot about that that always throws me off when i visit bc haha the baltimore sun was in the last season of the wire i guessing from its portrayal there that it is a pretty liberal paper well hes a breitbart writer so being published in a trashy tabloid is a major step up dont buy the sun one good thing i can say about scousers is that they follow this advice i think you use phrase im gonna  what i  you seriously rethink your perspective im gonna do to my cat what i did to my other catpet them and hug them and listen to their wonderful little purriness im gonna do to this burrito what i did to the other  burritos devour themand then probably throw up but worth i went to an eatallyouwant buffe yesterday now im a sizey person with a lot of room in my tummy that is only overshadowed by my wish to eat as much veggie thai food as i can then a bit more then a few pancakes to top it off then a cup of coffee and the since i feel so heavy in the stomach i need something to cool me down like a milkshakeit was a combined bestworst dinner ive had in years and you found thai pancakes coffee and milkshakes at the same ayce buffet that sounds glorious yes its a place in my town named global buff restaurangbasically they have thai sushi swedish food i live in sweden as well as some random stuff like ice creamso not only the stuff i mentioned but i also ate a nice bean salad with great dressing and some veggie sushihad i eaten meat i could also have combined it with swedish meatballs fish au gratin and some porky thing with honey on itfor about  usd thats a lot of foodbtw in sweden every restaurant has coffee nearly every hot dog stand has coffee  deleted heh unfortunately not pbut yeah if youre ever in gothenburg then check it out the quality of each dish may not be the superbest ever but the variance and amount for the money more than makes up for iti go there perhaps once a month for my own healths sake but yesterday they had unusually much nice veggie stuff im not sure if thats my idea or heaven or hell heaven or hellth you mean p i want to be there now iuhit seems i need to take a trip to sweden for umresearch purposes yeah runs to find passport swedish food  sorstrummungsp yeah surstrmming is very swedish but its not in all of sweden in my region its pretty rare but as you get northover it becomes much more common though its still kind of weird food and not something people eat on like a regular day but more that they have surstrmmingparties once a year or somethingive never eaten it and only smelled it when weve used it against nazis im gunna do to this comment what i do o all comments ignore the autocorrect failures and sort of loose my thread halfway burrito cats you monster hes a miniscule little person who thinks he has power he doesnt hes just a troll who desperately scrabbles to remain relevant by trying to be as offensive as possible but hes too predictable to even manage that he literally threatening destroy destroyed shanley wow ethics journalist ikr he really doesnt seem to realise that this doesnt look like journalism at all but petty animosity i know stuff that you dont want the public to know and ill reveal it if you behave in ways i dont like  could be be any more obvious in his wish to cause harm to women who dont know their place hes also basically admitting that the shanley stuff was nothing but a hit piece on someone he disliked way to go milo youre admitting that everyone who ever called you a pathetic excuse for a journalist was correct maybe might want to go brush up on that journalistic code of ethics gg was passing around a few months ago gt i know stuff that you dont want the public to know and ill reveal it if you behave in ways i dont like isnt this blackmail isnt that illegal its never been about journalism its always been about providing a platform for milos ego  he literally threatened her with it like i did to shanley holy shit i dont know who this shanley is i dont know if that discredits or reinforces his statement shes a feminist who writes about women in tech her exboyfriend was weev white supremacist hacker  and professional troll milo wrote a hitpiece on her using info from weev  weev said shanley used to share his racist views and he taught her to troll which lets be honest is rather irrelevant in light of her current views she took a break from twitter i guess she was talking about mra types trying to slutshame her today hes managed to monetize being a professional gossip deleted lol wut deleted lol gtposts in coontown subredditcancer and kiayeah gg totally isnt a right wing hate group  blech banned lol using ed sourcemilo is like journalisticfor seriouses though i where people hear coffins married sex doll shit where they go oh right wow total bullshit im wasting life at point trolls whore running shit up pretty stupid fucks pardon french will it but ed is a compulsive read and addictive sad when i google for peter coffin the majority of links are gatorrun so who is he exactly i read a storifya while back that only offered that coffin is just a youtuber that happened to be someone slade villena roguestar decided to target ive seen an accusationthat it started when coffin did a dramatic reading of roguestars manifestoi have no idea if that timeline is accurate or if the video was coffins way of striking back after the harassment started that it takes  days for someone to reply to that tweet with the fake girlfriend mythos might suggest that at least that part of the harassment hadnt started yet as of the time the video was made also peter used to post here but i havent seen him in a long time i really liked this videoof his the sex doll thing had already started on chan but it really blew up when cloudflare gave his details to hotwheels and who then spilled them on baph baph was created later in december though wasnt it and hotwheels tweeted cloudflare emails in january so that video published on dec th couldnt be a reaction to either it started on cow the harrassment was well under way when rogue jumped on the bandwagon it intensified later but rogue is really a small player in the whole thing ahhh gotcha thanks my knowledge about coffin is definitely limited to the storify that focused on rogueand the little bit ive peeped at his twitter some youtuber that gg got mad at these days theyve shifted from the free background check to the free personalized fanfic it seems i milo room journalistic ethics they met at a party thrown by academia oncemilo didnt know anyone there but insisted on being allowed to attend because his dad was friends with the landlordto be polite journalistic ethics made half a minute of awkward small talk with him with a forced smile on its face and then excused itselfmilo spent the rest of the evening in a corner with a metre of empty space around him havent they taken their best swings randi failed dismally i they find embittered zoepostshanleyblog treatment i imagine randi fuck apart correcting fabricated parts thankful shes longer with whatever loser trying wring minutes fame association with her like she said everything they threw at her she turned into a win this will probably be no different though im sure theyll try to spin it like anne wheaton donating to femfreq and itll look embarrassing i have no doubt milo will turn up a couple of people willing to whine about randi or make some bullshit up whatll be interesting to see is the gator reaction to it  whether their randi derangement syndrome will lead them to spread another garbage hit piece as gospel considering he phrased his ultimatum as id do to you what i did to shanley i think only the fringiest of journalists would take him seriously the rest of his audience are pretty much his attack dogs and treats them as such they already consider ed to be gospel most importantly fired telegraph hitler jokes i more the edgiest jokes of  wait til you hear his william henry harrison material and hes proud of it yes keep working angles using spurious sources milo im pulitzer corner and he was literally just talking about how he writes about important topics like the middle east not petty bullshit by the end of it hes digging for an expos on the critical global topic of randi harper ive covered wars you know if you worked with randi milo great job keep sending those emails wherein hashtags ukip yet no hashtag telling me why i should give a shit about what he thinks of the eu gt im shitstirrersatirist talk rights mid east than rd wave femfuck offfff racist screeds you hate arabs confer sort authority talk middle east use cudgel keep uppity women you piece shit on the plus side his use of rd wave fem as a reductive label is a handy indication to any reader not to take him seriously unless you happen to be a yearold edgelord does write definitive gay guide hes decided straight i wont claim to know what sexuality milo is or isnt but isnt it interesting that he appears to believe that sexuality is for pointscoring and nothing else some adults would be embarrassed by the admission that theyre still behaving like bratty and racist teenagers not milo its a badge he wears proudly i only ever saw that article because someone on facebook was holding it up as proof that all gay people choose their orientation i honestly dont know if he meant it to be taken seriously or not i just know how conservatives in the wild are reading it im sure that is satirical it is but its sometimes hard to see which parts in milos writing are jokes which parts are serious and which parts are just him pandering to his audience that particular article builds up to thisgtno other subset of the populace is as relentlessly maligned and demonised as those with the misfortune of being born white straight and a manand thats the part where milo is just telling his audience what they want to hear its absolutely depressing harrowing remorseless hack horrible shitstain person milo attention than people calling vile nature i see freebsdgirls posts on my twitter feed rarely do i see milo in the wild  well duh youre probably not subscribed to milos twitter feed  of milos followed are journalists whose friends have been screwed over by  him and cant wait to air his dirty laundry ok you got me he does have more attention hes an established journalist who used to be respectable so its not surprising he has more attention you can cost for years on early victories milo league arguing with popehatgtmilo women raped killed oppressed middle east western feminists stage complaining instagram commentsgtpopehat so people killed their views middle

anti-Harper subreddit.","subreddit":"metacanada","subredditId":"t5_2sh5g","thumbnail":"self","selftext":"I know you all may be confused as to why we are now an anti-Harper subreddit. Simply put, we have seen the light. No longer need we be brainwashed by Conservative propaganda. Read this list and *just try* to tell me you can honestly support the Harper Government. \n\n---\n\n**1. Contempt for Canada**\n\nThe Harper administration was found to be in contempt of Canadian parliament. This is the first time in the history of any commonwealth government that this has happened. The Speaker of the House of Commons had to rule three times that \"the Harper government\" appeared to breach parliamentary privilege.\n\n**2. Cheated in the 2006 Election**\n\nIn Spring of 2011, a federal court found that Harper\u0027s Conservatives wilfully violated the $18.3 million election spending limit, during the campaign which originally brought them to power in 2006. 4 Conservatives currently face charges and possible jail time.\n\n**3. Turned Canada\u0027s Surplus into Debt**\n\nIn 1993, the Conservatives chalked up a $38 Billion deficit. By 2006, under non-conservative leadership, this had been turned around into a $16 Billion surplus. Four years later, and Harper\u0027s Conservatives have returned Canada to a record $56 Billion deficit.\n\n**4. Wants US-style bank deregulation**\n\nWhen Harper was president of the National Citizens Coalition, founded in 1967 to oppose universal health care, he supported US-style bank deregulation. Nevertheless, since the 2008 Financial Crisis, he has been taking credit for the relative strength of our financial sector, based on a system he inherited, but didn’t support.\n\n**5. Opposes universal health care**\n\nHarper believes that universal health care should be provincial, and wants to break it up. While heading the National Citizens Coalition, founded to oppose universal health care, he said \"the feds\" should scrap the Canada Health Act.\n\n**6. Harper shut down Parliament. Twice.**\nOne of the Conservative platform promises was more accountability. Since making this promise, Harper has shut down Parliament twice. Once for several months to block an inquiry into Afghan detainees and to stall government bills, and a second time to avoid a vote of non-confidence which he was expected to lose.\n\n**7. Wants to replace the stable CPP with the untested PRPP**\n\nAlthough seniors\u0027 incomes have dropped for the first time in decades, it is clear that the Harper government was laying the groundwork to replace Canada\u0027s well-run, cost-effective, and stable CPP with a private, more expensive pension scheme - the Pooled Registered Pension Plan (PRPP), run by the bank, mutual fund, and insurance industries. This new plan would mean Canadians would have to work for longer, or to retire on less.\n\n**8. Shut down Women\u0027s and Minority advocacy groups**\n\nSince coming into power, Harper has cut funding for women\u0027s advocacy by 43 per cent, shut down 12 out of 16 Status of Women offices in Canada and eliminated funding of legal voices for women and minority groups, including the National Association of Women and the Law and the Courts Challenges Program.\n\n**9. The Economic Action plan has been to the benefit of the super rich**\n\nHarper\u0027s economic \u0027recovery\u0027 favoured the extremely wealthy. Over 321,000 Canadians lost their jobs in 2008 and Canadians\u0027 average wages fell. Meanwhile Canada\u0027s 100 wealthiest persons became richer, reaching an average net worth of $1.7 billion each, up almost 5 per cent from 2008. The majority of those surveyed by the Parliamentary Budget Office reported that the program has had either a neutral or negative impact on jobs. Even the conservative Fraser Institute has criticized it.\n\n**10. Fraud.**\n\nOne of Harper\u0027s top aides, Bruce Carson, had been convicted of 5 counts of fraud, and is currently under investigation by the RCMP. Most recently he was lobbying the government to buy water filtration systems, from a company where his wife was employed.\n\n**11. Loosened regulations to allow more chemical residues on your food**\n\nSince taking office, Stephen Harper has weakened regulations so that more pesticide residues can be left on your fruits and vegetables. The plan is to bring Canadian regulations in line with U.S. Levels, which can be up to 100 times higher. Under additional new regulations, corporate food producers will be allowed to conduct their own safety inspections. In 2008, when Luc Pomerleau, a biologist at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency with a flawless 20 year record with the agency, leaked these plans, he was immediately fired. Since then, the listeriosis meat outbreak killed 17 Canadians.\n\n**12. Wasteful G20 spending, and a record number of arrests**\n\nAt the 2010 G20 summit in Toronto, Harper spent $1.9 million building an artifical lake and nearly $1 Billion on security for the 3 day event. 1,105 arrests were made - the largest mass arrest in Canadian history. Of those 1,105 arrests, only 99 criminal charges were laid.\n\n**13. Report an unsafe nuclear reactor; get fired.**\n\nIn 2008, Linda Keen, President of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, reported that the aging Chalk River nuclear facility was at a risk 1000 times greater than the international average. Harper quickly fired her.\n\n**14. Stephen Harper has shut down Canadian aid to the world\u0027s most impoverished countries**\n\nDespite consistently pointing out that Canada\u0027s economy is a global leader - Harper used the excuse of poor economic times to freeze aid to some of the world\u0027s most impoverished countries. An example of this is the African nation of Malawi, one of the 10 poorest nations in the world. Before Harper, Canada was the 6th largest aid donor to Malawi, and the largest supplier of school books. After coming into power, he closed the Canadian embassy in Malawi and took the country (alongside 6 other African nations) off of Canada\u0027s aid priority list. Harper cut aid to Africa in half, before finally freezing all foreign aid in 2010.\n\n**15. The Harper Conservatives want to buy 65 stealth fighter jets using $29 billion of tax payers\u0027 money**\n\nThat works out to around $1000 per person in Canada. The Conservatives initially reported the cost would be $9 billion, plus $7 billion in maintenance costs. In March, Parliamentary Budget Officer Kevin Page warned Canadians that the Harper Government was low-balling the cost by more than $12 billion.\n\n**16. Refusal to sign UN declaration designating clean water as a human right.**\n\nIn the 2011 budget, the Harper government failed to allocate any new funding for drinking water on First Nations reserves. 100 First Nations communities currently have water advisories, including 49 communities which are high risk. He also refuses to sign the UN declaration designating clean water as a human right.\n\n**17. Harper tried to quietly eliminate the Canadian long form census**\n\nThe long form census is how our government determines the state and needs of the country, and is used extensively in various fields of research. In eliminating the census, many projects would be affected negatively, and it will become much more difficult to understand the needs of the country.\n\n**18. Never kept promises of cutting $1.4 Billion in federal subsidies given to oil companies**\n\nIn 2007, Harper cut $1.2 Billion from the establishment of national childcare, but failed to keep his promise of cutting the $1.4 billion in tax breaks he gives to oil companies, which continue to see record profits.\n\n**19. Sabotaging efforts to deal with climate change**\n\nProtecting the interests of large oil companies, Harper has fought global efforts to deal with climate change. In 2009, he cut science research funding by $138 Million, and imposed limitations on scientists at Environment Canada, requiring that they obtain permission to do interviews, and often screened their responses. The result is that Canadian media coverage of climate change science has been reduced by 80%. His efforts here have been so destructive, that in 2009 prominent politicians and scientists called for Canada to be removed from the Commonwealth. The last time this mark of shame was used, it was against South Africa while it was still under racist apartheid rule.\n\n**20. Cancelled the Kelowna accord**\n\nThe Kelowna accord was a $5 billion breakthrough agreement to improve the quality of health and education for Canada\u0027s First Nation\u0027s Peoples. Harper cancelled it in 2006, immediately after taking office.\n\n**21. Tarnishing our international reputation as Peacekeepers.**\n\n\u0027We detained, and handed over for severe torture, a lot of innocent people.\u0027 in 2009 Canadian Diplomat Richard Colvin shocked the nation with these words. In Afghanistan, Canada captured 6x more prisoners than the British and 20x as many as the Dutch. Colvin explained that \u0027Many were just local people: farmers; truck drivers; tailors, peasants...the likelihood is that all the Afghans we handed over were tortured.\u0027\n\n**22. Wants more power, less oversight**\n\nThe Conservatives have vowed to implement unprecedented levels of monitoring on Canadians\u0027 internet activities. Harper has tried and failed (4 times) to create a law that would implement mass scale internet surveillance, and that would allow the government access to private information without any warrants, and without any court oversight.\n\n**23. Wasteful prison spending increases, and shutting down rehabilitation centres**\n\nEven though crime rates have been falling for a decade, the Harper administration plans to implement tougher laws, and to incarcerate more Canadians than ever before. Plans are to double annual prison spending by 2015 (an increase of $5 billion annually). Meanwhile, six prison farms, considered by some to be Canada\u0027s most effective rehabilitation programs, where inmates produced food for themselves and other prisons - have been closed. This is in spite of having support from the majority of Canadians. Observers say that this will result in inmates being hardened, instead of healed.\n- See more at: http://www.whynotharper.ca/#printablelist","selftextHTML":"\u0026lt;!-- SC_OFF --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div class\u003d\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I know you all may be confused as to why we are now an anti-Harper subreddit.

Shut down Women\u0026amp;#39;s and Minority advocacy groups\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Since coming into power, Harper has cut funding for women\u0026amp;#39;s advocacy by 43 per cent, shut down 12 out of 16 Status of Women offices in Canada and eliminated funding of legal voices for women and minority groups, including the National Association of Women and the Law and the Courts Challenges Program.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;9. The Economic Action plan has been to the benefit of the super rich\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Harper\u0026amp;#39;s economic \u0026amp;#39;recovery\u0026amp;#39; favoured the extremely wealthy. Over 321,000 Canadians lost their jobs in 2008 and Canadians\u0026amp;#39; average wages fell. Meanwhile Canada\u0026amp;#39;s 100 wealthiest persons became richer, reaching an average net worth of $1.7 billion each, up almost 5 per cent from 2008. The majority of those surveyed by the Parliamentary Budget Office reported that the program has had either a neutral or negative impact on jobs. Even the conservative Fraser Institute has criticized it.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;10. Fraud.\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;One of Harper\u0026amp;#39;s top aides, Bruce Carson, had been convicted of 5 counts of fraud, and is currently under investigation by the RCMP. Most recently he was lobbying the government to buy water filtration systems, from a company where his wife was employed.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;11. Loosened regulations to allow more chemical residues on your food\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Since taking office, Stephen Harper has weakened regulations so that more pesticide residues can be left on your fruits and vegetables. The plan is to bring Canadian regulations in line with U.S. Levels, which can be up to 100 times higher. Under additional new regulations, corporate food producers will be allowed to conduct their own safety inspections. In 2008, when Luc Pomerleau, a biologist at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency with a flawless 20 year record with the agency, leaked these plans, he was immediately fired. Since then, the listeriosis meat outbreak killed 17 Canadians.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;12. Wasteful G20 spending, and a record number of arrests\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;At the 2010 G20 summit in Toronto, Harper spent $1.9 million building an artifical lake and nearly $1 Billion on security for the 3 day event. 1,105 arrests were made - the largest mass arrest in Canadian history. Of those 1,105 arrests, only 99 criminal charges were laid.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;13. Report an unsafe nuclear reactor; get fired.\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In 2008, Linda Keen, President of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, reported that the aging Chalk River nuclear facility was at a risk 1000 times greater than the international average. Harper quickly fired her.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;14. Stephen Harper has shut down Canadian aid to the world\u0026amp;#39;s most impoverished countries\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Despite consistently pointing out that Canada\u0026amp;#39;s economy is a global leader - Harper used the excuse of poor economic times to freeze aid to some of the world\u0026amp;#39;s most impoverished countries. An example of this is the African nation of Malawi, one of the 10 poorest nations in the world. Before Harper, Canada was the 6th largest aid donor to Malawi, and the largest supplier of school books. After coming into power, he closed the Canadian embassy in Malawi and took the country (alongside 6 other African nations) off of Canada\u0026amp;#39;s aid priority list. Harper cut aid to Africa in half, before finally freezing all foreign aid in 2010.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;15. The Harper Conservatives want to buy 65 stealth fighter jets using $29 billion of tax payers\u0026amp;#39; money\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;That works out to around $1000 per person in Canada. The Conservatives initially reported the cost would be $9 billion, plus $7 billion in maintenance costs. In March, Parliamentary Budget Officer Kevin Page warned Canadians that the Harper Government was low-balling the cost by more than $12 billion.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;16. Refusal to sign UN declaration designating clean water as a human right.\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In the 2011 budget, the Harper government failed to allocate any new funding for drinking water on First Nations reserves. 100 First Nations communities currently have water advisories, including 49 communities which are high risk. He also refuses to sign the UN declaration designating clean water as a human right.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;17. Harper tried to quietly eliminate the Canadian long form census\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The long form census is how our government determines the state and needs of the country, and is used extensively in various fields of research. In eliminating the census, many projects would be affected negatively, and it will become much more difficult to understand the needs of the country.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;18. Never kept promises of cutting $1.4 Billion in federal subsidies given to oil companies\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In 2007, Harper cut $1.2 Billion from the establishment of national childcare, but failed to keep his promise of cutting the $1.4 billion in tax breaks he gives to oil companies, which continue to see record profits.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;19. Sabotaging efforts to deal with climate change\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Protecting the interests of large oil companies, Harper has fought global efforts to deal with climate change. In 2009, he cut science research funding by $138 Million, and imposed limitations on scientists at Environment Canada, requiring that they obtain permission to do interviews, and often screened their responses. The result is that Canadian media coverage of climate change science has been reduced by 80%. His efforts here have been so destructive, that in 2009 prominent politicians and scientists called for Canada to be removed from the Commonwealth. The last time this mark of shame was used, it was against South Africa while it was still under racist apartheid rule.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;20. Cancelled the Kelowna accord\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The Kelowna accord was a $5 billion breakthrough agreement to improve the quality of health and education for Canada\u0026amp;#39;s First Nation\u0026amp;#39;s Peoples. Harper cancelled it in 2006, immediately after taking office.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;21. Tarnishing our international reputation as Peacekeepers.\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026amp;#39;We detained, and handed over for severe torture, a lot of innocent people.\u0026amp;#39; in 2009 Canadian Diplomat Richard Colvin shocked the nation with these words. In Afghanistan, Canada captured 6x more prisoners than the British and 20x as many as the Dutch. Colvin explained that \u0026amp;#39;Many were just local people: farmers; truck drivers; tailors, peasants...the likelihood is that all the Afghans we handed over were tortured.\u0026amp;#39;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;22. Wants more power, less oversight\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The Conservatives have vowed to implement unprecedented levels of monitoring on Canadians\u0026amp;#39; internet activities. Harper has tried and failed (4 times) to create a law that would implement mass scale internet surveillance, and that would allow the government access to private information without any warrants, and without any court oversight.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;23. Wasteful prison spending increases, and shutting down rehabilitation centres\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Even though crime rates have been falling for a decade, the Harper administration plans to implement tougher laws, and to incarcerate more Canadians than ever before. Plans are to double annual prison spending by 2015 (an increase of $5 billion annually). Meanwhile, six prison farms, considered by some to be Canada\u0026amp;#39;s most effective rehabilitation programs, where inmates produced food for themselves and other prisons - have been closed. This is in spite of having support from the majority of Canadians. Observers say that this will result in inmates being hardened, instead of healed.\n- See more at: \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://www.whynotharper.ca/#printablelist\"\u0026gt;http://www.whynotharper.ca/#printablelist\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;","domain":"self.metacanada","gilded":0,"commentCount":35,"score":18,"upVotes":18,"downVotes":0,"created":1.389321067E9,"createdUTC":1.389321067E9,"visited":false,"self":false,"saved":false,"edited":false,"stickied":false,"nsfw":false,"hidden":false,"clicked":false,"users":["loneconservative","[deleted]","harvo","[deleted]","vanderbugger","[deleted]","reddit4lifedawg","barosa","harvo","barosa","rockonparker","[deleted]","reddit4lifedawg","awarethelegend","barosa","[deleted]","barosa","[deleted]","ergonomicndplover","[deleted]","awarethelegend","only_never","[deleted]","loneconservative","toughitoutcupcake","ergonomicndplover","barosa","[deleted]","barosa","charasmash","[deleted]","dave35","plonkys","loneconservative","only_never","zionistbill","canucksluo","lucky75"],"kind":"t3","identifier":"1uumlo","fullName":"t3_1uumlo"},{"user":{"username":"hellovn","modhash":"ca811axhrr4406206fb17310d1181ef458e779eff52cd6165d","cookie":"31563347,2015-06-15T10:36:27,666e275ac47ccc1a59788ba95e19e1c1c7be5677","password":"111111"},"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/16c7st/harpers_wife_liquidates_entire_stock_portfolio/c7uphqw","commentContent":"i liquidated stock profile  years ago at i going reinvest i ended up partying till gone maybe mrs harper wants slizzered long time financially retarded way embrace bad decisions liquidated your stockes  maybe you are a lesbofry cant you see the connectionit couldnt be that she is intending to reinvest elsewhere that would be too obviousshit mine mature every  years the portfolio is sometimes renewed but often liquidated and reinvestedbut then again i do likes me the ladies so maybe im lesbian gtat first i was going to reinvest instead i ended up partying till it was all goneand we all know what you meant by partying well that was awkward so meta subs i posts titled i think theyre completely contrived find nope posts referenced that dumb what this i even ","permalink":"/r/metacanada/comments/16cmf4/mrs_harper_is_a_closet_lesbo_who_is_about_divorce/?ref\u003dsearch_posts","author":"toughitoutcupcake","title":"Mrs Harper is a closet Lesbo who is about divorce her husband.

Short story: she is in another state , new life, no chance of continuing. We parted amicably.  The Fat Lady has well and truly sang on Opera Woman.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Sitting on the hotel bed by myself I shed a tear (or two). But being the bastard cheater that I am I decided not to waste the room and \u0026amp;quot;dust myself off and get back on the horse\u0026amp;quot; by calling an escort. TBH I was still horny as fuck even after the bad news. Enter Kandy, Allan Harper\u0026amp;#39;s second wife. I never though there was anyone on this planet with Kandy\u0026amp;#39;s voice or personality. Well, I found her. She didn\u0026amp;#39;t look like Kandy(also went by another name) but if I closed my eyes I was right next to her.  She took everything I said literaly, just like Kandy. And just like Kandy she is one sweet girl. She is no Opera Woman but I was definitely singing a different tune by the time I came home....\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON
