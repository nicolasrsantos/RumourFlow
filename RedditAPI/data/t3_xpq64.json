That\u0027s probably the main reason McCain went with Palin over Romney in \u002708; he had to appeal to the GOP base.  Only the GOP had to go with Romney this year because the party has become so screwed-up and was left with no other viable candidates that they liked and who might beat Obama.  Now they\u0027re just gonna have to sit there and take whatever baggage comes with Romney, because they hate Obama so much.
