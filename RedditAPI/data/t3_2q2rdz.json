An estimated 286 to 890 civilians have been killed, including 168 to 197 children. Amnesty International found that a number of victims were unarmed and that some strikes could amount to war crimes.\r\rhttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_attacks_in_Pakistan\r","duration":"","id":410,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cn2i7c8","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":409,"links":[392],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Sleekery","label":"[Drones killed 0-4 Pakistani civilians in 2013](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-01-21/news/sns-rt-us-pakistan-drones-20140120_1_civilian-casualties-strikes-drone) (out of 108-195 total killed) and [0-2 Pakistani civilians in 2014](http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2014/06/11/obama-2014-pakistan-drone-strikes/) (out of 104-168 total killed), according to the anti-drone British non-profit organization, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.\n\nOverall:\n\n* [Bureau of Investigative Journalism](http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/category/projects/drones/drones-graphs/) \u003d 77-83% militants.\n\n* [New America Foundation](http://natsec.newamerica.net/drones/pakistan/analysis) \u003d 80-90% militants in Pakistan from 2004-2014.\n\n* [Columbia Human Rights Clinic (PDF)](http://web.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/microsites/human-rights-institute/files/COLUMBIACountingDronesFinal.pdf) \u003d 72-87% militants in Pakistan in 2011.

Because I hate to break it to you but the legality of this \u0027war\u0027 you talk about is highly debated. \n\n\u0026gt;In a classic rhetorical device Brennan threw out perhaps the most contentious aspect of his analysis as though it was a given, stating that “as a matter of international law, the United States is in an armed conflict with al-Qa’ida, the Taliban, and associated forces.”\n\n\u0026gt;This legal analysis, while widely accepted in the United States, is both highly contentious and deeply flawed. In fact, it is so contentious that no other NATO member shares it.\n\n\u0026gt;Wars are fought between states in defined theaters of conflict. Brennan drew a comparison with World War II, but World War II was fought on the territories occupied by the parties to the conflict and not just anywhere that was considered expedient.\n\n\u0026gt;In World War II the United States and its allies recognized the neutrality of non-combatant states.\n\nPeople are being bombed in countries we are not at war with, and manny innocent people are dying because of it. \n\n\u0026gt;If anything, they\u0027re more precise\n\nThat\u0027s another misconception, from the same article:\n\n\u0026gt;There are two distinct types of CIA drone mission: ‘personality strikes’ and ‘signature strikes’. Personality strikes target an individual on one of the Obama administration’s kill lists. **Signature strikes are operations triggered by pattern analysis – pulling together threads such as suspect vehicles, suspect buildings, communications nodes, group numbers and patterns of behavior to identify a promising target of opportunity.**\n\nYou know how sometimes Netflix recommends something to you that you really hate? Thats because data and profiling are inherently flawed, they can easily be misrepresented and read incorrectly. \n\n\u0026gt;We know that it took fourteen attempts before the CIA finally killed the leader of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) Baitullah Mehsud in a drone strike in Waziristan in 2009.

Their primary sources are media outlets, for which they try to build a consensus, erring on the side of reporting more civilian casualties.\n\n* The Columbia Human Rights Clinic describes their criteria for identifying victims as civilians and militants on page 24, which is basically their independent analysis of media reports and other drone-tracking organizations.\n\n* The Long War Journal gets their numbers from Pakistani sources and original reporting.\n\n* The AP interviewed local villagers to obtain their number.

This places them third in the country for the entire Gallup poll of 16 American institutions. They ranked higher than things like the Supreme Court, the medical system, and most importantly the Presidency. For comparison, the Presidency enjoyed a confidence rating of only 29%. And, if you want to compile their \u0027disapproval\u0027 rating, only 16% of Americans have very little to no confidence in the police, while 44% of Americans have little to no confidence in the Presidency.\n\nI would contend you\u0027re misapplying the experience of the urban poor to that of all poor. Rural and suburban poor likely don\u0027t have anywhere near the experience of poor urban minorities. Their interactions with the police are likely limited and less combative. I think it would even be foolish to assume as you did that all urban poor hate cops, just as it would be foolish to think all wealthy Americans like cops. There is certainly a correlation with class but there are without a doubt those who don\u0027t conform to that norm in every class. And the data presented corroborates the fact that confidence in the police cannot be purely class based just on the numbers (otherwise people would not have such high confidence in the police). \n\nAll things considered I think you\u0027d be hard pressed to find someone who is more closely scrutinized than the president. And to those who want to argue that recent events have changed perceptions of the police, that may be the case but these polls are done annually so there isn\u0027t really reliable data to show recent changes. And I can\u0027t imagine the recent swing is so drastic as to completely reverse the current perception.","duration":"","id":725,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_cn2gdx5","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":723,"links":[722],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Greensmoken","label":"I think its definitely possible for over half the country to hate cops.

Period.  Any level of disruption of our government would be acceptable to root out a systemic corruption which allows such barbaric acts, and we would be better for it in the future.\n\nI know it\u0027s not going to happen, but we can at least do what we can to make sure it doesn\u0027t become acceptable to our culture as Americans.","duration":"","id":898,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cn2hefh","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":798,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"sumner67","label":"Never happen because it would lead to 3/4 of congress and the current administration being investigated and prosecuted too. \n\nWhy can\u0027t people get it through their heads that this wasn\u0027t just bush/cheney doing this?

What I mean is that it is optimal strategy in game theory as it relates to control over the natural resources in the world that determine the future economic hegemony of a state(America). Labeling it neoconservative has some weird negative connotations that I do not think  should be attached to it(labels in general cloud objectivity). It is actually a brutally realistic view on how  to protect your people(state) economically in the long run.  Something whose very existence and way of life(economic well being) is always in peril in time frames that span 20 years.  Just because you aren\u0027t playing the game does not mean others are not, therefore you must play ball or eventually not exist because you let someone else decide the outcomes of regional/outside state affairs that directly influence your future economic well being in some way(worst case scenario would be \"in a bad way\". This comes into conflict with a lot of morals/social norms we have but it is a reality we must deal with in increasingly interconnected or globalized economy.  How are you going to tell your people who are now starving that you did all you could when you let a foreign state\u0027s politics be determined by variables that do not favor your people\u0027s interests? And you just let it happen because x.  That\u0027s not the state acting in its people\u0027s interests even though the people may be against this action. Very real variables produce the future prosperity of a country, you just can\u0027t ignore those. \n\nI think people don\u0027t realize that ethical state behavior is different from ethical people behavior because the consequences of action or inaction are radically different. A state acting could save millions of your people\u0027s lives and the literal quality of life of your people.  It would be great if we could produce this peaceful world where we treat everyone as if they are equal and all humans but we have to acknowledge what moral limits that are presented to us by the scarce resources that allow us to sustain the population we are trying to produce a respectable quality of life for.  China does not have a respectable quality of life for people, not even close. Yeah the economic gap between rich and poor in America is bad, but America\u0027s poor aren\u0027t really poor compared to China\u0027s.  America is able to do great things for its own people while being the guardian of western civilization, literally, if you look at America\u0027s role in NATO.  The western world is not better  because of some prejudice, it actually is, as it allows less suffering to exist for the greatest amount of people in an area.  America\u0027s problems are \"first world problems\", despite people acting as if every American problem is some apocalyptic problem,  they are relatively insignificant in comparison to most non western countries.
