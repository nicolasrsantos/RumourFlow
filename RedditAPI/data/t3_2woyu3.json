I think Bill Nye talked about it when he had that debate with Ken Ham. Basically, you just bombard the other side with so many points that it becomes a downright chore to reply to each one, even though all of the points may be falsifiable. So when you give up, it looks like you\u0027ve lost! You\u0027ll also notice that the points are repeated frequently regardless of how much they\u0027ve been debunked (melted steel, for example).\n\nA tactic that conspiracy theorists really like to use is to bring up anomalies, like the passport thing. Anomalies are strange because you\u0027d think that they don\u0027t happen frequently, that\u0027s in the definition. But because of the staggering number of events going on at any given time, anomalies happen frequently. And so, for every major conspiracy there\u0027s a major anomaly to go with it which will then be used to support a conspiracy theory. And really, the best explanation for an anomaly is that \"it just happens!\" which isn\u0027t very satisfactory.\n\nBut the biggest issue, by far, is that you\u0027re generally not having a discussion with someone who is willing to be convinced. I tried this discussion bit many years ago with creationists but it\u0027s just not very fun or productive. I mean, it helps me understand my own point of view, so that\u0027s nice. But aside from that, it\u0027s just a waste of time.\n\nSo yeah, I understand that it can all make their responses seem more valid, but it does get very frustrating to deal with. :p","duration":"","id":195,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_cotaev0","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":194,"links":[193],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Prayball","label":"I\u0027m arguing that the point is that if you dismiss them it makes the problem worse.

I think Bill Nye talked about it when he had that debate with Ken Ham. Basically, you just bombard the other side with so many points that it becomes a downright chore to reply to each one, even though all of the points may be falsifiable. So when you give up, it looks like you\u0027ve lost! You\u0027ll also notice that the points are repeated frequently regardless of how much they\u0027ve been debunked (melted steel, for example).\n\nA tactic that conspiracy theorists really like to use is to bring up anomalies, like the passport thing. Anomalies are strange because you\u0027d think that they don\u0027t happen frequently, that\u0027s in the definition. But because of the staggering number of events going on at any given time, anomalies happen frequently. And so, for every major conspiracy there\u0027s a major anomaly to go with it which will then be used to support a conspiracy theory. And really, the best explanation for an anomaly is that \"it just happens!\" which isn\u0027t very satisfactory.\n\nBut the biggest issue, by far, is that you\u0027re generally not having a discussion with someone who is willing to be convinced. I tried this discussion bit many years ago with creationists but it\u0027s just not very fun or productive. I mean, it helps me understand my own point of view, so that\u0027s nice.
