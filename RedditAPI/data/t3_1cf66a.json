Authorities have not blamed anyone, although [unreliable tabloids](http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/authorities_under_suspect_guard_y2m8cJO29uC2PDGIjYBalO?utm_source\u003dSFnewyorkpost\u0026amp;utm_medium\u003dSFnewyorkpost) have unearthed that the police may have detained a Saudi national who was himself injured in the bombing -- and may, in fact, be a victim rather than a perpetrator of the attack. The Boston Police Department has [denied](http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/boston-police-no-arrests-have-been-made-in) they have arrested a Saudi national.\n\nBefore anyone had been blamed at all, FOX News Contributor Erik Rush had already [tweeted](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/erik-rush-kill-all-muslims-response-boston-marathon-attack), \"Kill All Muslims\". Likewise, commentators from [Breitbart](http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/04/15/Report-Post-Saudi-national) have already blamed Islam, the Arab Spring, and President Obama for complicity in the attack.\n\nThis is not new. As with previous terrorist attacks, Muslims are blamed before it is even clear who carried out the attack. After the Oklahoma City Bombing, for example, carried out by a white, non-Muslim American terrorist, Muslims were blamed and [a number of hate crimes were carried out against individuals perceived as Muslim or Arab](http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page\u003dtopic\u0026amp;tocid\u003d463af2212\u0026amp;toid\u003d469f2df32\u0026amp;publisher\u003d\u0026amp;type\u003d\u0026amp;coi\u003dUSA\u0026amp;docid\u003d45db101e2\u0026amp;skip\u003d0). Likewise, news station after news station [blamed Islam and Muslims](http://mediamatters.org/research/2011/07/25/media-rushed-to-suggest-radical-muslims-might-h/183148) for the horrendous murder of hundreds of children in Norway at the hands of an Islamophobic, pro-Israel, right-wing fanatic. \n\nAlthough it is too soon to say who carried out the attack, there is no reason to prematurely dismiss the notion that the killer could fit the profile of the various despondent white men who carried out recent mass shootings, or that he could be a right-wing extremist like Anders Brevik or Timothy McVeigh. In the event that he is, not only will the right-wing commentators seem more obviously insane than they do now, it is almost certain that they will not switch their hatred to blame \"the West,\" \"Christianity,\" or other identifiers as they do with the Arab and Muslim world. \n\nBut if the killer is a Muslim, and if he is associated with an anti-American Islamist organization such as Al Qaeda, certain things are almost certainly true:\n\nA) He was most likely not motivated by Islam, but by opposition to U.S. military aggression in the Muslim world. Almost every independent analysis suggests that acts of terrorism such as this one and its support stem from opposition to occupying forces. A 2004 DOD study suggested that [Muslims do not \"hate our freedom\" but \"hate our policies\"](http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/dod/dsb/commun.pdf) (page 40). An independent analysis by counter terrorism expert Robert Pape, funded by the Defense Department found [virtually no correlation between suicide bombings and Islam, but plenty of correlation between suicide bombings and perceived foreign military occupation.](http://www.politico.com/blogs/laurarozen/1010/Researcher_Suicide_terrorism_linked_to_military_occupation.html?showall). The notion that Muslims, and Muslim extremists especially, simply hate America for its culture or feel motivated by their religion to attack, and other cultural explanations for politically-motivated terrorism are designed to degrade and objectify a part of the world, muting the motives for animosity and making terrorist attacks seem incomprehensible. \n\nB) He had nothing to do with the Arab Spring. The Arab Spring, with the exception of Syria, has been almost completely non-violent and based on mass protest. Although right-wing extremists often blame Obama for not properly suppressing the Arab Spring -- perceiving democracy in the Middle East as a threat to American power and to Israel -- the reality is the exact opposite. The Obama Administration has continued backing Arab autocrats against their own people, in [Bahrain](http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2012/0514/US-resumes-arms-sales-to-Bahrain.-Activists-feel-abandoned), [Saudi Arabia](http://www.washdiplomat.com/index.php?option\u003dcom_content\u0026amp;view\u003darticle\u0026amp;id\u003d8818:us-saudi-relationship-weathers-arab-spring\u0026amp;catid\u003d1496\u0026amp;Itemid\u003d428), [Yemen](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/when-us-drones-kill-civilians-yemens-government-tries-to-conceal-it/2012/12/24/bd4d7ac2-486d-11e2-8af9-9b50cb4605a7_print.html), [Tunisia](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-zunes/us-backs-tunisian-dictato_b_808886.html), and even [Libya](http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/157348.pdf) (where he later broke with the dictator and supported an [illegal war on that country](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/21/opinion/21Ackerman.html) ). In Egypt, the Obama Administration [continued to support Mubarak](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2011/01/obama_and_mubarak_and_democrac.html) until it was clear that the regime risked collapse, and sought to [buy off newly elected Muslim Brotherhood](http://www.policymic.com/articles/15530/muslim-brotherhood-and-obama-us-sends-450-million-dollars-in-aid-to-egypt) as they repeat the abuses of prior dictatorship.\n\nIt is unclear why right-wing extremists would link shady news reports blaming a Saudi suspect for this bombing to the Arab Spring at all, except out of Islamphobia and American chauvinism. The notion that Obama\u0027s perceived \"weakness\" in failing to prevent the downfall of some Middle Eastern autocrats motivated the attack is exactly the opposite of reality: it is American \"strength\" -- namely, its military occupations, support for Israel, support for dictatorship, drone strikes against Muslims, and other interventionist and aggressive policies -- that are not only listed in poll after [poll](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/feb/15/us-obama-muslims-animosity-deepens) for why the Muslim world is critical of the United States, but are also confirmed by the studies above and by the [manifestos of terrorist organizations themselves](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/military/july-dec96/fatwa_1996.html). \n\nC) He thwarted an extensive system of surveillance, armed security personnel, and security measures. A security expert [described to the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/us/explosions-reported-at-site-of-boston-marathon.html?pagewanted\u003d2) how Boston PD had used analytic cameras, rooftop snipers, and helicopters, and had welded manhole covers shut and run through the marathon\u0027s path. That is in addition to any information about the culprit (who at the moment, isn\u0027t even known) that could have been mined by intelligence agencies investigating terrorism. Despite the fact that we live in a wholesale surveillance society, with cameras, rooftop snipers, warrantless searches, see-through airport scanners, kill lists, e-mail mining, and other abuses of power, someone was able to plant a number of crude explosive devices and kill at least two people while injuring far more in public. \n\nThis is more evidence that high-security \"counter-terrorism\" measures that violate civil liberties are ineffective in stopping terrorist attacks while effective in mining data about the general population. \n\nOn a more personal note, as an American currently living in a predominantly Muslim country -- one where Obama\u0027s apparent \"weakness\" during the Arab Spring has nonetheless involved sending millions of dollars in tear gas and bullets to the same police apparatus that existed before the revolution -- I am disturbed by the anti-Muslim rhetoric being spread about. Everyone here is just as upset about the bombing and they have sent me their condolences. ","selftextHTML":"\u0026lt;!-- SC_OFF --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div class\u003d\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Already, right-wing extremists are blaming Islam and Muslims for the Boston bombings which killed 2 people and injured dozens more. Authorities have not blamed anyone, although \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/authorities_under_suspect_guard_y2m8cJO29uC2PDGIjYBalO?utm_source\u003dSFnewyorkpost\u0026amp;amp;utm_medium\u003dSFnewyorkpost\"\u0026gt;unreliable tabloids\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; have unearthed that the police may have detained a Saudi national who was himself injured in the bombing -- and may, in fact, be a victim rather than a perpetrator of the attack. The Boston Police Department has \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/boston-police-no-arrests-have-been-made-in\"\u0026gt;denied\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; they have arrested a Saudi national.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Before anyone had been blamed at all, FOX News Contributor Erik Rush had already \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/erik-rush-kill-all-muslims-response-boston-marathon-attack\"\u0026gt;tweeted\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, \u0026amp;quot;Kill All Muslims\u0026amp;quot;. Likewise, commentators from \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/04/15/Report-Post-Saudi-national\"\u0026gt;Breitbart\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; have already blamed Islam, the Arab Spring, and President Obama for complicity in the attack.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This is not new. As with previous terrorist attacks, Muslims are blamed before it is even clear who carried out the attack. After the Oklahoma City Bombing, for example, carried out by a white, non-Muslim American terrorist, Muslims were blamed and \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page\u003dtopic\u0026amp;amp;tocid\u003d463af2212\u0026amp;amp;toid\u003d469f2df32\u0026amp;amp;publisher\u003d\u0026amp;amp;type\u003d\u0026amp;amp;coi\u003dUSA\u0026amp;amp;docid\u003d45db101e2\u0026amp;amp;skip\u003d0\"\u0026gt;a number of hate crimes were carried out against individuals perceived as Muslim or Arab\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;. Likewise, news station after news station \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://mediamatters.org/research/2011/07/25/media-rushed-to-suggest-radical-muslims-might-h/183148\"\u0026gt;blamed Islam and Muslims\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; for the horrendous murder of hundreds of children in Norway at the hands of an Islamophobic, pro-Israel, right-wing fanatic. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Although it is too soon to say who carried out the attack, there is no reason to prematurely dismiss the notion that the killer could fit the profile of the various despondent white men who carried out recent mass shootings, or that he could be a right-wing extremist like Anders Brevik or Timothy McVeigh. In the event that he is, not only will the right-wing commentators seem more obviously insane than they do now, it is almost certain that they will not switch their hatred to blame \u0026amp;quot;the West,\u0026amp;quot; \u0026amp;quot;Christianity,\u0026amp;quot; or other identifiers as they do with the Arab and Muslim world. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;But if the killer is a Muslim, and if he is associated with an anti-American Islamist organization such as Al Qaeda, certain things are almost certainly true:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A) He was most likely not motivated by Islam, but by opposition to U.S. military aggression in the Muslim world. Almost every independent analysis suggests that acts of terrorism such as this one and its support stem from opposition to occupying forces. A 2004 DOD study suggested that \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/dod/dsb/commun.pdf\"\u0026gt;Muslims do not \u0026amp;quot;hate our freedom\u0026amp;quot; but \u0026amp;quot;hate our policies\u0026amp;quot;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; (page 40). An independent analysis by counter terrorism expert Robert Pape, funded by the Defense Department found \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/laurarozen/1010/Researcher_Suicide_terrorism_linked_to_military_occupation.html?showall\"\u0026gt;virtually no correlation between suicide bombings and Islam, but plenty of correlation between suicide bombings and perceived foreign military occupation.\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;. The notion that Muslims, and Muslim extremists especially, simply hate America for its culture or feel motivated by their religion to attack, and other cultural explanations for politically-motivated terrorism are designed to degrade and objectify a part of the world, muting the motives for animosity and making terrorist attacks seem incomprehensible. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;B) He had nothing to do with the Arab Spring. The Arab Spring, with the exception of Syria, has been almost completely non-violent and based on mass protest. Although right-wing extremists often blame Obama for not properly suppressing the Arab Spring -- perceiving democracy in the Middle East as a threat to American power and to Israel -- the reality is the exact opposite. The Obama Administration has continued backing Arab autocrats against their own people, in \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2012/0514/US-resumes-arms-sales-to-Bahrain.-Activists-feel-abandoned\"\u0026gt;Bahrain\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://www.washdiplomat.com/index.php?option\u003dcom_content\u0026amp;amp;view\u003darticle\u0026amp;amp;id\u003d8818:us-saudi-relationship-weathers-arab-spring\u0026amp;amp;catid\u003d1496\u0026amp;amp;Itemid\u003d428\"\u0026gt;Saudi Arabia\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/when-us-drones-kill-civilians-yemens-government-tries-to-conceal-it/2012/12/24/bd4d7ac2-486d-11e2-8af9-9b50cb4605a7_print.html\"\u0026gt;Yemen\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-zunes/us-backs-tunisian-dictato_b_808886.html\"\u0026gt;Tunisia\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, and even \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/157348.pdf\"\u0026gt;Libya\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; (where he later broke with the dictator and supported an \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/21/opinion/21Ackerman.html\"\u0026gt;illegal war on that country\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; ).
