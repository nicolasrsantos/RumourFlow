According to Stephen Szymanski of the University of Michigan, [until 1980 \"soccer\" and \"football\" were interchangeably used in Britain](http://ns.umich.edu/Releases/2014/June14/Its-football-not-soccer.pdf), when \"soccer\" became less popular because of a mistaken belief that it is an Americanism.\n\n[In the English-speaking world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_\\(word\\)#National_usage), \"football\" is only unambiguously association football in Great Britain. In Ireland, \"football\" \u003d Gaelic football or rugby union, and \"soccer\" is frequently used. In Australia, \"football\" \u003d rugby, rugby league, or Australian rules. In New Zealand, \"football\" \u003d rugby or association football. In South Africa (as /u/Arrow218 mentioned), association football is called \"soccer\" as often as in the US. In Canada, \"football\" \u003d American or Canadian football. In other words, **among English speakers Brits are outnumbered—whether by population or number of countries—in terms of how they use \"football\".**\n\nItaly uses \"calcio\", which means \"to kick\". Yet, for some strange reason Italians never ever get criticized for not calling the sport \"football\" or some other language\u0027s variant of that word, nor do self-loathingly pretentious Italians feel the need to call the sport by its \"correct\" name; strange, that.","duration":"","id":58,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_crto5pf","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":49,"links":[48],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"linesreadlines","label":"Fun fact: It\u0027s a region specific Oxford slang, that adds an -er to ends of things, like \"rugger\" for rugby, \"soccer\" for as**soc**iation football and \"tenner\" for a ten pound bill.
