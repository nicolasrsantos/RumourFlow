Policy decisions are also often taken without debate or explanation, and a small group of officials — known as the executive committee — operates with outsize power. FIFA has for years functioned with little oversight and even less transparency. Alexandra Wrage, a governance consultant who once unsuccessfully attempted to help overhaul FIFA’s methods, famously labeled the organization “byzantine and impenetrable.”\n\n\n\u0026gt;Law enforcement officials said much of the inquiry involves Concacaf, one of the six regional confederations that compose FIFA. Concacaf — which stands for Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football — includes major countries like the United States and Mexico, and also tiny ones like Barbados and Montserrat.\n\n\n\u0026gt;According to the indictment, several international soccer events were tainted by bribes and kickbacks involving media and marketing rights: World Cup qualifiers in the Concacaf region; the Gold Cup, a regional championship tournament; the Concacaf Champions League; the Copa América; and the ASouth American club championship, the Copa Libertadores. The indictment also claims that bribes and kickbacks were found in connection with the selection of the host country for the 2010 World Cup.\n\n\n\u0026gt;Concacaf was led from 1990 to 2011 by Mr. Warner, the longtime head of Trinidad \u0026amp; Tobago’s federation. A key powerbroker in FIFA’s governing executive committee, Mr. Warner had been dogged by accusations of corruption. He was accused of illegally profiting from the resale of tickets to the 2006 World Cup, and of withholding the bonuses of the Trinidad players who participated in that tournament.\n\n\n\u0026gt;Mr. Warner resigned his positions in FIFA, Concacaf and his national association in 2011 amid mounting evidence that he had been part of an attempt to buy the votes of Caribbean federation officials in the 2011 FIFA presidential election. A 2013 Concacaf report also found that he had received tens of millions of dollars in misappropriated funds.\n\n\n\u0026gt;But according to the rules of FIFA at the time, Mr. Warner’s resignation led to the immediate closure of all ethics committee cases against him. “The presumption of innocence is maintained,” FIFA said in a short statement announcing his departure.\n\n\n\u0026gt;Many observers found the bid process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to be flawed from the start: the decision to award two tournaments at once, critics said, would invite vote-trading and other inducements. Since only the 24 members of the executive committee would decide on the hosts, persuading even a few of them might be enough to swing the vote.\n\n\n\u0026gt;Even before the vote took place, two committee members — Amos Adamu of Nigeria and Reynald Temarii of Tahiti — were suspended after an investigation by The Sunday Times caught both men on tape asking for payments in exchange for their support. It was later revealed by England’s bid chief that four ExCo members had solicited bribes from him for their votes; one asked for $2.5 million, while another, Nicolas Leoz of Paraguay, requested a knighthood.\n\n\n\u0026gt;As new accounts of bribery continued to emerge — a whistleblower who worked for the Qatar bid team claimed that several African officials were paid $1.5 million each to support Qatar — FIFA in 2012 started an investigation of the bid process. It was led by a former United States attorney, Michael J. Garcia, who spent nearly two years compiling a report. That report, however, has never been made public; instead, the top judge on the ethics committee, the German Joachim Eckert, released a summary of the report. In it, he declared that while violations of the code of ethics had occurred, they had not affected the integrity of the vote.\n\n\n\u0026gt;Within hours, Garcia had criticised Eckert’s summary as incorrect and incomplete, charging that it contained “numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts.” Nonetheless, FIFA moved quickly to embrace the report’s absolution of the bid process. Qatar World Cup officials said the review had upheld “the integrity and quality of our bid,” And Russia’s sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, told reporters, “I hope we will not have talk about this again.”\n\n\n\u0026gt;The issue was, in fact, raised against Wednesday. When pressed by reporters at the news conference, Mr. de Gregorio repeatedly said that FIFA would not consider reopening the bid process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.\n\n***\n\n[And here\u0027s FIFA\u0027s response.](http://i.imgur.com/A6lGjPJ.jpg)\n","duration":"","id":6,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_crmdhxo","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"FIFA Officials Arrested on Corruption Charges; Sepp Blatter Isn’t Among Them.","label":"ballsywallsy","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_37g3wr","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.43275438E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.432754803E9,"simScore":0.6675770861267835,"sentiment":"  Positive"},{"index":7,"links":[6],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"zvcx","label":"FIFA have their own investigation into corruption, dont release the report, say they found nothing wrong.

We\u0027ve seen van Persie not being able to sprint after a ball around minute 70 and we\u0027ve also seen a younger player like Shaw having to be subbed off because he was tired after 50 or 60 minutes.\n\nObviously, not all players are equally affected by running and/or sprinting, but isn\u0027t it strange that a few players (the most obvious case being Cristiano) don\u0027t seem to be affected by that *at all*? Physically, technically and mentally flawless regardless if it\u0027s the 5th minute of the match or if we\u0027re 15 minutes into extra time of a Champions League final, *your 55+th match of the season*.

Every little thing helps. And it\u0027s not like dodgy techniques are new, there\u0027s been quite a few cases throughout recent history involving Ajax, Barcelona [and even Guardiola was suspended for four months in 2001](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/10424370/Flashback-Pep-Guardiolas-failed-drug-test-in-2001.html).\n\nDenying this is akin to denying the doping in cycling. It\u0027s extremely likely that all the big clubs, including United, use some sort of technique to enhance the performance of the players, to help them with their concentration, nerves, blood oxygen levels, etc.  These techniques may not be currently illegal (I\u0027m not sure), but are things that most clubs would rather not talk about. And when a case comes up, there are many players or officials that say that doping \"is the norm.\" It happened in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, 00s, and we\u0027re going to pretend it doesn\u0027t happen now?\n\nEDIT: Here is an article that talks about [the case of Juventus in the nineties](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-drug-scandal-that-blackens-the-name-of-juves-team-of-the-nineties-6156776.html), and [a great article about doping in the last 50 years of football](http://web.archive.org/web/20130315050531/http://www.4dfoot.com/2013/02/09/doping-in-football-fifty-years-of-evidence).","duration":"","id":34,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_crmkt5i","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":33,"links":[32],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"shinkag","label":"Lol, the bit about performance enhancing drugs is bullshit.
