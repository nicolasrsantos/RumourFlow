This was the fault of the Bush administration. \"Sovereign\" countries like Yemen and Somalia have had military operations since 2001 as well. This is a poor argument\n\n2) Republicans all conspired together to block everything Obama tried to accomplish, they admitted this in speeches and books talking about private dinners the leadership had. To claim Obama could have done more is just blatantly false. Plus the health problems of Ted Kennedy meant they were short 1 vote for months, and even then they needed the conservative Joe Lieberman to pass anything.\n\nRemember this is a new different era of politics, in the Clinton era you only needed 50 votes in the Senate plus the Vice President to break the 50-50 split.\n\nToday, Republicans made it so **every big vote now requires 60 votes in the Senate.**\n\nThat is a huge change, blaming Obama is wrong.\n\n3) Obamacare barely passed, and you want to pretend Single payer had a chance? Serious question here, how old are you? Do you know anything about politics?\n\n4) Of course wall st made out better than everyone else, that is how the economy works, and has worked since the country started, but especially since de-regulation starting with Carter then Reagan.\n\nYou couldn\u0027t jail most bankers because they did nothing criminal. You can\u0027t just throw bankers in jail for revenge this is a democracy. There were mortgage bankers who went to jail for fraud though. So this argument is wrong.\n\nObama couldn\u0027t do much about inequality since Congress writes laws.\n\nWall st is everyone\u0027s biggest contributor, blame finance laws.\n\nThe nominations were done because again, Republicans blocked EVERYTHING and Obama had to nominate people that Republicans accepted.\n\nUnemployment rate differences has always been the case, this is not a really good argument to make just like it wasn\u0027t during the Bush years either. Of course the working age population needs more jobs, but again this goes back to Congress writing laws to help them, not have dictator Obama create magic out of thin air. The New Deal required Congress to act, it wasn\u0027t FDR doing everything by himself.\n\nNo idea about this complaint with GM, manufacturing jobs are very strong with companies like GM making profits and hiring new workers and building plants, the doom and gloom claim of America not building anything anymore is wrong.\n\n5) Claiming people are misinformed while your entire post is 100% misinformation is the height of hypocrisy. \n\nYou are misinformed for not understanding Obama didn\u0027t campaign as being a liberal, he campaigned on being a hardline tough on terrorism pro military candidate who was going to change the cronyism of the Bush years and do everything to help regular people. Obamacare was the first step, helping fix the economy the next, then the 2010 midterms and the Dems lost the House and barely hung onto the Senate. Then the blocking of laws got worse, and government really couldn\u0027t do anything to help like Obama promised. So blame Republicans and some Democrats for not supporting policies that would work because their voters hate the idea of Obama. \n\n\u0026gt;is a president worse than W. because he has legitimated and continued the worst excesses of the Executive branch under the Cheney/ W. regime\n\nDumbest thing ever said.

Be realistic. You\u0027re being far too idealistic and naive. And, no offense, but extremely ignorant. You\u0027re upset about things that contradict other things and you have very little to back up your claims. \n\nGM is not a financial service company. It\u0027s a car company. GMAC sold the majority of it\u0027s shares in 2006 to a holdings group, which included Goldman Sach\u0027s. They filed bankruptcy, and now GMAC is called Ally Bank. It is now profitable, as well. \n\nWould you like to show me a list of the people he\u0027s nominated, these cronies? INitially he brought back the same economic team Bill Clinton had. That\u0027s not cronyism, it\u0027s using people who have had the success doing the same thing in the past. It\u0027s smart. The only move I can see that was bad was electing the head of that cable company as the head regulator for the industry. Outside of that keep in mind this is the man who brought Elizabeth Warren in to handle TARP and other financial issues. Also, not to make this the longest paragraph ever but his appointments need to be approved by congress, they filibustered basically everyone, we didn\u0027t have have heads for numerous government agencies for over A YEAR because of the filibusters. Take a look at this graph: http://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/11/22/National-Politics/Graphics/w-Filibuster296.jpg?uuid\u003d96xxplMQEeOe5iWACG2CVA \n\nI am a realist. I would love for Obama to be able to do what FDR did. And in a way, I believe he has. Things move slowly in Washington, and when you have a congress that can\u0027t get anything passed, it\u0027s extremely hard to do anything. \n\n\u0026gt; The reported unemployment rate the U3 is a highly massaged statistic. What matters most is how bad inequality is, and inequality has grown more under Obama than any other President. Yes, our economy depended on the American \"consumer,\" but the \"consumer\" depended on a Keynesian notion that demand drives the economic growth, so policies (and taxes) worked to redistribute wealth and profits to lessen inequality and increase demand on an individual level.\n\nIs there a point there or did you just copy and paste something. The inequality we have started with the Bush Tax cuts. Bush took over with a gigantic surplus and decided, while at war, to LOWER taxes on the rich (no President had ever lowered taxes at war time, ever). So, the top 1 percent has done incredibly well, even through the \"great recession\" but the lower, working and middle classes have stagnated. I wouldn\u0027t necessarily say that that is Obama\u0027s fault. \n\nObama returned the top tax rate to the rate that it was under Clinton. And he got hell for it. It was only 3.6% but people flipped out. He also went after offshore bank accounts, etc. \n\n[Please read this, in regards to inequality](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/07/28/heres-why-obama-should-get-credit-for-reducing-income-inequality/). It has grown under him, but he has done what he can to make it grow less. The snow ball Bush pushed has grown out of control. The affordable care act (which I am proud to say I am using), the student loan relief, the tax raising on the top 1 percent. \n\n[This shows what the inequality would\u0027ve been had he simply gone along with what Bush did](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/07/23/obama_and_income_inequality_after_taxes_the_rich_poor_gap_is_shrinking.html) honestly, it\u0027s going to take decades to fix what Bush did. The deficit rose so high under Obama partially because he decided to put the war cost on the deficit, which Bush didn\u0027t do because he didn\u0027t want to seem like a deficit spender. \n\nAgain, under the realities of the situation. He has done a great job. I truly believe that. Your views on drone strikes are simply completely wrong. We don\u0027t support any leaders of consequence right now. Assad isn\u0027t our friend. But, let\u0027s be honest. Like I said. Things were better when Hussein and Gaddafi were in power. More stable. And when you\u0027re fighting a \"war\" with people with no uniforms or borders, you\u0027re going to have to attack in sovereign nations. And, if you were correct in your assertion that we support ineffectual leaders, then why are you and them complaining about how we are violating their sovereign borders??? \n\nThis is what drives me crazy. Obama supporters turning on the guy instead of supporting him when they can\u0027t even make a two sentence argument without completely contradicting themselves. \n\nThe bottom line is things take time, and he\u0027s laid a great foundation for the future that will help lessen the damaging effects of the W. era. Even FDR didn\u0027t get what he wanted in regards to healthcare, or the second \"economic\" bill of rights he was going to push through congress. He understood and stated that he laid the groundwork for healthcare, and LBJ helped expand on that. Reagan tore it apart, as did W. Obama is going back to the traditions of the real Democrats, and I support him for it.

I didn\u0027t add that to my list because Obama didn\u0027t write that bill, but that\u0027s a huge accomplishment in it\u0027s own right and is something that you need to understand. \n\nObama is simply working under the reigns of the system. Be realistic. You\u0027re being far too idealistic and naive. And, no offense, but extremely ignorant. You\u0027re upset about things that contradict other things and you have very little to back up your claims. \n\nGM is not a financial service company. It\u0027s a car company. GMAC sold the majority of it\u0027s shares in 2006 to a holdings group, which included Goldman Sach\u0027s. They filed bankruptcy, and now GMAC is called Ally Bank. It is now profitable, as well. \n\nWould you like to show me a list of the people he\u0027s nominated, these cronies? INitially he brought back the same economic team Bill Clinton had. That\u0027s not cronyism, it\u0027s using people who have had the success doing the same thing in the past. It\u0027s smart. The only move I can see that was bad was electing the head of that cable company as the head regulator for the industry. Outside of that keep in mind this is the man who brought Elizabeth Warren in to handle TARP and other financial issues. Also, not to make this the longest paragraph ever but his appointments need to be approved by congress, they filibustered basically everyone, we didn\u0027t have have heads for numerous government agencies for over A YEAR because of the filibusters. Take a look at this graph: http://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/11/22/National-Politics/Graphics/w-Filibuster296.jpg?uuid\u003d96xxplMQEeOe5iWACG2CVA \n\nI am a realist. I would love for Obama to be able to do what FDR did. And in a way, I believe he has. Things move slowly in Washington, and when you have a congress that can\u0027t get anything passed, it\u0027s extremely hard to do anything. \n\n\u0026gt; The reported unemployment rate the U3 is a highly massaged statistic. What matters most is how bad inequality is, and inequality has grown more under Obama than any other President. Yes, our economy depended on the American \"consumer,\" but the \"consumer\" depended on a Keynesian notion that demand drives the economic growth, so policies (and taxes) worked to redistribute wealth and profits to lessen inequality and increase demand on an individual level.\n\nIs there a point there or did you just copy and paste something. The inequality we have started with the Bush Tax cuts. Bush took over with a gigantic surplus and decided, while at war, to LOWER taxes on the rich (no President had ever lowered taxes at war time, ever). So, the top 1 percent has done incredibly well, even through the \"great recession\" but the lower, working and middle classes have stagnated. I wouldn\u0027t necessarily say that that is Obama\u0027s fault. \n\nObama returned the top tax rate to the rate that it was under Clinton. And he got hell for it. It was only 3.6% but people flipped out. He also went after offshore bank accounts, etc. \n\n[Please read this, in regards to inequality](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/07/28/heres-why-obama-should-get-credit-for-reducing-income-inequality/). It has grown under him, but he has done what he can to make it grow less. The snow ball Bush pushed has grown out of control. The affordable care act (which I am proud to say I am using), the student loan relief, the tax raising on the top 1 percent. \n\n[This shows what the inequality would\u0027ve been had he simply gone along with what Bush did](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/07/23/obama_and_income_inequality_after_taxes_the_rich_poor_gap_is_shrinking.html) honestly, it\u0027s going to take decades to fix what Bush did. The deficit rose so high under Obama partially because he decided to put the war cost on the deficit, which Bush didn\u0027t do because he didn\u0027t want to seem like a deficit spender. \n\nAgain, under the realities of the situation. He has done a great job. I truly believe that. Your views on drone strikes are simply completely wrong. We don\u0027t support any leaders of consequence right now. Assad isn\u0027t our friend. But, let\u0027s be honest. Like I said. Things were better when Hussein and Gaddafi were in power. More stable. And when you\u0027re fighting a \"war\" with people with no uniforms or borders, you\u0027re going to have to attack in sovereign nations. And, if you were correct in your assertion that we support ineffectual leaders, then why are you and them complaining about how we are violating their sovereign borders??? \n\nThis is what drives me crazy. Obama supporters turning on the guy instead of supporting him when they can\u0027t even make a two sentence argument without completely contradicting themselves. \n\nThe bottom line is things take time, and he\u0027s laid a great foundation for the future that will help lessen the damaging effects of the W. era. Even FDR didn\u0027t get what he wanted in regards to healthcare, or the second \"economic\" bill of rights he was going to push through congress. He understood and stated that he laid the groundwork for healthcare, and LBJ helped expand on that. Reagan tore it apart, as did W. Obama is going back to the traditions of the real Democrats, and I support him for it.

And he publicly defends those excesses, institutionally defends them and expands them, all while undermining the concept of citizenship in this country.\n\nSo lets take your points as you presented them.\n\n1) Al Qaeda. Yeah, Obama bagged bin Laden. But the drone war and the insertion of special forces into sovereign countries while supporting corrupt, ineffectual \"leaders\" in the ME has only caused the chaos to spread (Syria, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Somali, Mali, Gaza) and re-ignite in Iraq. While he scores tactical victories and cuts off the head of jihadi groups, jihadism as a movement (or struggle) has only grown and metastasised. The strategy of the GWOT is a failure, yet Obama continues it.\n\n2) The GOP. Look, Obama in 2008 had OFA, I giant grassroots org that got him elected. He used to work for ACORN. He could have, if he really wanted to bring about serious change, continued to use OFA as an adjunct to the Democratic party apparatus (as in touting local pols who will come to DC to support the agenda), as well as having OFA stage actions against various Congresspeople in their district. \nYou want to move a politician into your column without money, then give them lots of bad press.\n\nInstead OFA existed as a fundraising mechanism and an email blast list. While Obama sold himself as a change agent, he really isn\u0027t into change.\n\n3) Obamacare. Single payer was taken off the table. The ACA was written by a Biden staffer who went to United Health after the laws passage. There\u0027s lots of critical writing about the ACA from the left, because a lot of us see this as the government guaranteeing insurance company profits. \n\n4) The economy. Wall St. crashed and a bunch of banksters made out big and continue to make out big, as the rest of us working stiffs are making less and less. \n\n* None of the banksters have even made a perp walk (and Madoff doesn\u0027t count).\n* The same issues that crashed the economy still exist and are even bigger (derivatives, derivatives, and integrals (that\u0027s a joke))\n* Obama talked about inequality and did nothing about it. While he can\u0027t legislate, he does have a bully pulpit, used effectively by T. Roosevelt for trustbusting. Shame is incredibly powerful.\n* Wall St. was/is his biggest contributor.\n* Nominates people who are Wall St. cronies for key positions in the SEC, etc.\n* The reported unemployment rate the U3 is a highly massaged statistic. What matters most is how bad inequality is, and inequality has grown more under Obama than any other President. Yes, our economy depended on the American \"consumer,\" but the \"consumer\" depended on a Keynesian notion that demand drives the economic growth, so policies (and taxes) worked to redistribute wealth and profits to lessen inequality and increase demand on an individual level. \n* He saved GM (which is really a financial services company) while letting the PE (private equity) vultures continue to come into industry after industry to offshore jobs and sell off capital stock (machinery) while engaging in financial shenanigans that lead to serious instability and economic crises.

Obama, 727 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2012)\n\nThe district court held that (a) Nasser Al-Aulaqi lacked standing to sue because he had failed to provide an adequate explanation for why his son was unable to appear on his own behalf and that, in any event, (b) Nasser Al-Aulaqi’s claims presented the complex policy questions historically held non-justiciable under the political question doctrine.\n\nQuoting Baker v. Carr, the court set forth the Supreme Court’s six-factor political question test: \n\n* [1] a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or \n* [2] a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or \n* [3] the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or \n* [4] the impossibility of a court’s undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of respect due coordinate branches of government; or \n* [5] an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or \n* [6] the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.”\n\nQuoting El-Shifa, the court explained, “[i]t is not the role of judges to second-guess, with the benefit of hindsight, another branch’s determination that the interests of the United States call for military action.” And, “any post hoc judicial assessment as to the propriety of the Executive’s decision to employ military force abroad ‘would be anathema to … separation of powers’ principles.”\n\nhttp://www.lawfareblog.com/wiki/the-lawfare-wiki-document-library/post-911-era-materials/post-911-era-materials-court-cases/al-aulaqi-v-obama-727-f-supp-2d-1-d-d-c-2010/","duration":"","id":65,"color":"black","redditID":"t1_ckbvt3u","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":64,"links":[63],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"KazooMSU","label":"I am not confusing the two.
