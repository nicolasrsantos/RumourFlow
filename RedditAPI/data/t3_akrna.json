Professionals doing research (engineers, and so on) publish papers in either scientific or trade journals that their peers read. That way their peers can review their work.

Yes, I can make the argument stronger than I did here.  (There\u0027s always a trade off--brevity vs. detail.  And there\u0027s always \"inattentional blindness\" lurking, as any programmer knows--it\u0027s so easy to make little mistakes here and there.  It takes careful debugging to craft a message.  That\u0027s the very thing people guffawing about being made aware of logical fallacies--that these are logical bugs that need to be removed.  That people don\u0027t realize these are bugs and that they need to be removed is itself a form of inattentional blindness.)\n\n\nExactly:  Just because someone makes a logical fallacy in an argument does not mean that the thesis of the argument is bogus.  Indeed, and I pointed that out yesterday in an effort to get people here to stop using these misleading fallacy-ridden arguments which blind people from seeing facts objectively.  Regardless, this does not excuse people from using logic; my aim is to draw attention to the art of thinking.\n\nIndeed, there are ways to make excuses for Sunder\u0027s in-person comments.  What is inexcusable is that this is representative of their entire investigation.  I pointed out a few such problems, and I can point out many more.  \n\nNIST ruled out conclusively something for which they did not have conclusive evidence.  That is a logical problem found not just in Sunder\u0027s comments on one day but in the means of investigation itself.  Certainly we should not trust their conclusions if they failed to address something that may be crucial to consider.\n\nImportant to keep in mind (and I\u0027ll provide more support for this assertion below):  NIST has failed to assert.  Appeals to them as an ultimate source of truth are appeals to unauthorized authority.  This is important to realize:  Arguments based on NIST\u0027s claims are logically flawed as a result.  Realizing that makes the next bits of evidence make more sense. \n\n1) Something crucial that David Chandler pointed out and NIST changed their tune about at the last minute:  freefall occurred.  \n\nDavid Chandler\u0027s Videos Concerning the Rate of Freefall Acceleration of WTC7:\n\nWTC7: NIST Finally Admits Freefall (Part I)\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dV0GHVEKrhng  (10 min)\n\nWTC7: NIST Finally Admits Freefall (Part II)\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dXtKLtUiww80  (10 min)\n  - They created a simulation of WTC7, so obviously they did deal with more than one data point--an unrepresentative sample.  (Unscientific and a logical fallacy known as a hasty generalization.)  Yet that simulation has never been made available in a usable form, so we cannot verify the integrity of their model.  But using independently available data, we can know it is flawed.  This is what David Chandler pointed out and why NIST significantly revised their assessments about whether freefall occurred.  (I believe it is in this same video that Sunder claims in August 2008 that freefall could not have occurred.  Yet that\u0027s exactly the story his final report claims, which was released later that year.)\n\nWTC7: NIST Finally Admits Freefall (Part III)\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dVz43hcKYBm4  (10 min)\n\n\n2)  Something crucial that NIST still denies:  temperatures higher than NIST claims\n\nThe color of the metal flowing from the South Tower minutes before its destruction tells us that there\u0027s a problem with the explanation NIST gave concerning temperatures in the buildings (that maximum peak temperatures were 1100C or roughly 2012F):  Aluminum would look silvery at that temperature.  (Nobody has done experiments to show how aluminum can look orange at those temperatures, but yet NIST uses this red herring--in the absence of experimental data--to answer the question.  In fact, experiments have shown aluminum does not mix with organics, as NIST\u0027s unscientific explanation would have you believe.)\n\nHere\u0027s a link that has various bits of evidence:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dfs_ogSbQFbM\n(The argument can be made stronger than in this commercial-like video, but there\u0027s a lot of good stuff in there quickly.  Of course, logical fallacies can be used to argue against every bit of the evidence--but that does not cause this evidence to be worthless.  You just have to learn to spot the fallacies.  Sorry I don\u0027t have space here to share the list of pertinent fallacies I\u0027ve seen used to respond to this kind of stuff.  Usually, though, the red herring fallacy is among the more popular.) \n\nConcerning the orange molten metal:\n\nHere\u0027s a little physics tutorial for any who may need it:\n\nIn physics we talk about \"blackbody\" radiation.  The wavelength distribution of a black body turns out to be a function of temperature and nothing else.  Composition is irrelevant.  It doesn\u0027t even have to be the chemical properties of an object that cause it to be black.  A commonly used blackbody in the lab is a stack of razor blades, looking at the adjacent wedge edges.  Light incident on the stack of edges will undergo multiple reflections before coming back out, so essentially all of it is absorbed regardless of wavelength.  A cavity (made of any kind of material) with a small hole in it is black by virtue of multiple reflections of any light that enters, so essentially none gets back out.  A heated cavity thus will follow exactly the same radiation law.  The Exploratorium in San Francisco had a display with a simple 3\" x 5\" card file box painted black, with a hole in  the lid.  The question was which was blacker: the box or the hole.  Even with a light shining on it, the hole was clearly blacker than flat black paint.  When you open the box it turned out to be painted white inside.  Yet the cavity acted as a better \"black body\" than the chemically black paint, since it absorbed essentially all the light that entered.\n\nThe blackness of the body is significant because it simplifies things.  A black object is an \"unbiased absorber\" of all wavelengths of light.  The key point is that the same characteristics of a body that make it absorb light are exactly the same characteristics that cause it to radiate when heated (same process driven in reverse), so an unbiased absorber will be an unbiased emitter.  The lack of bias (of one wavelength rather than another) is what makes the radiation follow the simple, calculable radiation distribution law.  Therefore color is a function of temperature AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nMany real objects, even those that don\u0027t look particularly black, approximate black bodies when heated.  Therefore the color charts for metals at different temperatures will be close to, if not exactly the same as, the calculated blackbody radiation curve.\n\nTherefore the color indicates the temperature of what we are seeing.  The color indicates that whatever we are looking at is hot enough to melt steel.  If it was lead or aluminum, it was still hot enough to melt steel.  The simplest assumption, therefore, is that we are looking at molten steel, or possibly molten iron from a thermitic process being used to attack the steel.\n\n\nSidebar: Sunder claims in the August 21, 2008 phone interview with noliesradiowas that this metal was silver.  NIST\u0027s Web site has a contradictory claim since before John Gross made his assertions that there was no molten metal that he knew of:  NIST\u0027s Web site claims it must have been molten aluminum mixed with organics, but they made this bare assertion logical fallacy without any experimental data to support it.  In fact, experiments have been done that show molten aluminum at temperatures NIST claims were in the buildings would actually be silver.  Furthermore, nobody has shown as NIST asserted, without evidence, that anything can mix with molten aluminum to become orange.  And where is this mixer that would uniformly mix the hypothetical organic materials with molten metal?

Yes, I can make the argument stronger than I did here.  (There\u0027s always a trade off--brevity vs. detail.  And there\u0027s always \"inattentional blindness\" lurking, as any programmer knows--it\u0027s so easy to make little mistakes here and there.  It takes careful debugging to craft a message.  That\u0027s the very thing people guffawing about being made aware of logical fallacies--that these are logical bugs that need to be removed.  That people don\u0027t realize these are bugs and that they need to be removed is itself a form of inattentional blindness.)\n\n\nExactly:  Just because someone makes a logical fallacy in an argument does not mean that the thesis of the argument is bogus.  Indeed, and I pointed that out yesterday in an effort to get people here to stop using these misleading fallacy-ridden arguments which blind people from seeing facts objectively.  Regardless, this does not excuse people from using logic; my aim is to draw attention to the art of thinking.\n\nIndeed, there are ways to make excuses for Sunder\u0027s in-person comments.  What is inexcusable is that this is representative of their entire investigation.  I pointed out a few such problems, and I can point out many more.  \n\nNIST ruled out conclusively something for which they did not have conclusive evidence.  That is a logical problem found not just in Sunder\u0027s comments on one day but in the means of investigation itself.  Certainly we should not trust their conclusions if they failed to address something that may be crucial to consider.\n\nImportant to keep in mind (and I\u0027ll provide more support for this assertion below):  NIST has failed to assert.  Appeals to them as an ultimate source of truth are appeals to unauthorized authority.  This is important to realize:  Arguments based on NIST\u0027s claims are logically flawed as a result.  Realizing that makes the next bits of evidence make more sense. \n\n1) Something crucial that David Chandler pointed out and NIST changed their tune about at the last minute:  freefall occurred.  \n\nDavid Chandler\u0027s Videos Concerning the Rate of Freefall Acceleration of WTC7:\n\nWTC7: NIST Finally Admits Freefall (Part I)\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dV0GHVEKrhng  (10 min)\n\nWTC7: NIST Finally Admits Freefall (Part II)\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dXtKLtUiww80  (10 min)\n  - They created a simulation of WTC7, so obviously they did deal with more than one data point--an unrepresentative sample.  (Unscientific and a logical fallacy known as a hasty generalization.)  Yet that simulation has never been made available in a usable form, so we cannot verify the integrity of their model.  But using independently available data, we can know it is flawed.  This is what David Chandler pointed out and why NIST significantly revised their assessments about whether freefall occurred.  (I believe it is in this same video that Sunder claims in August 2008 that freefall could not have occurred.  Yet that\u0027s exactly the story his final report claims, which was released later that year.)\n\nWTC7: NIST Finally Admits Freefall (Part III)\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dVz43hcKYBm4  (10 min)\n\n\n2)  Something crucial that NIST still denies:  temperatures higher than NIST claims\n\nThe color of the metal flowing from the South Tower minutes before its destruction tells us that there\u0027s a problem with the explanation NIST gave concerning temperatures in the buildings (that maximum peak temperatures were 1100C or roughly 2012F):  Aluminum would look silvery at that temperature.  (Nobody has done experiments to show how aluminum can look orange at those temperatures, but yet NIST uses this red herring--in the absence of experimental data--to answer the question.  In fact, experiments have shown aluminum does not mix with organics, as NIST\u0027s unscientific explanation would have you believe.)\n\nHere\u0027s a link that has various bits of evidence:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dfs_ogSbQFbM\n(The argument can be made stronger than in this commercial-like video, but there\u0027s a lot of good stuff in there quickly.  Of course, logical fallacies can be used to argue against every bit of the evidence--but that does not cause this evidence to be worthless.  You just have to learn to spot the fallacies.  Sorry I don\u0027t have space here to share the list of pertinent fallacies I\u0027ve seen used to respond to this kind of stuff.  Usually, though, the red herring fallacy is among the more popular.) \n\nConcerning the orange molten metal:\n\nHere\u0027s a little physics tutorial for any who may need it:\n\nIn physics we talk about \"blackbody\" radiation.  The wavelength distribution of a black body turns out to be a function of temperature and nothing else.  Composition is irrelevant.  It doesn\u0027t even have to be the chemical properties of an object that cause it to be black.  A commonly used blackbody in the lab is a stack of razor blades, looking at the adjacent wedge edges.  Light incident on the stack of edges will undergo multiple reflections before coming back out, so essentially all of it is absorbed regardless of wavelength.  A cavity (made of any kind of material) with a small hole in it is black by virtue of multiple reflections of any light that enters, so essentially none gets back out.  A heated cavity thus will follow exactly the same radiation law.  The Exploratorium in San Francisco had a display with a simple 3\" x 5\" card file box painted black, with a hole in  the lid.  The question was which was blacker: the box or the hole.  Even with a light shining on it, the hole was clearly blacker than flat black paint.  When you open the box it turned out to be painted white inside.  Yet the cavity acted as a better \"black body\" than the chemically black paint, since it absorbed essentially all the light that entered.\n\nThe blackness of the body is significant because it simplifies things.  A black object is an \"unbiased absorber\" of all wavelengths of light.  The key point is that the same characteristics of a body that make it absorb light are exactly the same characteristics that cause it to radiate when heated (same process driven in reverse), so an unbiased absorber will be an unbiased emitter.  The lack of bias (of one wavelength rather than another) is what makes the radiation follow the simple, calculable radiation distribution law.  Therefore color is a function of temperature AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nMany real objects, even those that don\u0027t look particularly black, approximate black bodies when heated.  Therefore the color charts for metals at different temperatures will be close to, if not exactly the same as, the calculated blackbody radiation curve.\n\nTherefore the color indicates the temperature of what we are seeing.  The color indicates that whatever we are looking at is hot enough to melt steel.  If it was lead or aluminum, it was still hot enough to melt steel.  The simplest assumption, therefore, is that we are looking at molten steel, or possibly molten iron from a thermitic process being used to attack the steel.\n\n\nSidebar: Sunder claims in the August 21, 2008 phone interview with noliesradiowas that this metal was silver.  NIST\u0027s Web site has a contradictory claim since before John Gross made his assertions that there was no molten metal that he knew of:  NIST\u0027s Web site claims it must have been molten aluminum mixed with organics, but they made this bare assertion logical fallacy without any experimental data to support it.  In fact, experiments have been done that show molten aluminum at temperatures NIST claims were in the buildings would actually be silver.  Furthermore, nobody has shown as NIST asserted, without evidence, that anything can mix with molten aluminum to become orange.  And where is this mixer that would uniformly mix the hypothetical organic materials with molten metal?  Occam\u0027s razor anyone?","duration":"","id":55,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_c0i4zzo","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":54,"links":[53],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"obtrusiveinterloper","label":"Well first of all, just because someone makes a logical fallacy this does not ipso facto debunk their beliefs, argument, ect.\n\nIt has to address the fundamental point they are making, or in a larger and more casual way demonstrate a pattern in their thinking.\n\nI\u0027m not familiar with the particular circumstance you are talking about, it may be he was making a logical fallacy.\n\nI will say that to say on one hand \"it would have taken too many explosives\" and on the other \"it was done without explosives\" is not necessarily contradictory.

This is what I feared: self-proclaimed experts drawing wrongful conclusions from blurry pixels.  My random thoughts:\n\n* A slight delay in live TV is not unexpected.  But 17 seconds is hardly enough to edit a flying plane in.\n* Do not, ever, take a reporter\u0027s live comment as face value.  They are not experts either and they are often completely clueless about what just happened.  They too try and make sense of the same blurry pixels, only they have to do it live.  They are prone to be wrong.\n* The pixel comparison in video 1 is unconvincing (it\u0027s not the pixel perfect copy they claim it to be).  Besides, the plane going out of the other side can be seen on every video, network or private.\n* Video 2 starts by claiming that *all* videos of the event are fake, which should ring an alarm.  This is simply not a credible position.\n* A plane can seem a different color and shape from different angles.  Its trajectory can also seem different and it can sound different.  Basically, video 2 is a collection of badly inspired claims.\n* In continues in video 3.  The shots that are deemed identical are clearly taken from different heights: one has the ground as a background to the towers, the other has the sky (no, it\u0027s not an erased background).  They are not the same video so it\u0027s normal that the trajectories look different (and consistent with each POV).\n* When video 3 asks \"is your intelligence insulted yet?\" the answer is yes, but not how they think it is.\n\nI\u0027ll stop there.  The whole piece doesn\u0027t have much value.  The only thing I found intriguing are the live black flashes on two networks.  The rest is just misinterpretation of images (I won\u0027t even mention proofs based on testimonials and live comments because that\u0027s ridiculous).","duration":"","id":60,"color":"black","redditID":"t1_c0i7npw","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":59,"links":[58],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"ghibmmm","label":"\u0026gt; He\u0027s not saying he\u0027s right because his scientists are better, he\u0027s saying his scientists published papers that can be scrutinized by their peers, which is the scientific method and not an appeal to authority.\n\nPeer review is not part of the scientific method, it is an attempt (and a misguided one, in its current implementation) to ensure that the scientific method is adhered to properly in experiments.

I was wondering if the following is indeed correct / plausible explanation. It all seems logical to me. \n\nHe said they were not constructed in the \u0027traditional\u0027 method; instead they were a central core with the elevators/electrical/pluming with a outer \u0027shell\u0027 composed only steel. The core and the shell were only connected with beams designed to carry the load of the floor / occupants. He then showed us a structure composed of a bottom plate and a top plate (a fair distance apart) connected with only with small metal rods. As you can imagine it was pretty unstable, prone to torsional and compressive loads. He then added additional plates in between the top and bottom plate (think of them as  floors) and voila it was very stable. Anyways, that was the his attempt to show us the basic idea of the structure of the towers. \n\nHe then went on to explain that the jet fuel (which burns at a higher temperature than normal office fires) melted the connecting beams between the outer shell and inner core (similar to removing the intermediate plates in his demo structure). He really stressed that the impact of the plane did not cause the building to fail, of course the WTC was designed to survive a plane impact, it\u0027s happened by accident with other tall towers in the past. He said that it was designed so that the connecting beams could survive a normal office fire, but no one really designed the beams that support the floors to hold up to 200k litters of jet fuel burning. \n\nAnyways he then took out the intermediate plates form his little demo, and applied a vertical compressive force simulating the weigh of the floors on top of it. Of course the metal vertical rods buckled outwards eventually leading to failure. He said that caused an entire floor of the tower to drop down onto the next floor that was also weakened. By the time all of this hit the unawakened floors, it had enough momentum and force to buckle to next floor leading to a domino effect. \n\nAnyways, that\u0027s how the guy described it, it sounds logical to me.

I was wondering if the following is indeed correct / plausible explanation. It all seems logical to me. \n\nHe said they were not constructed in the \u0027traditional\u0027 method; instead they were a central core with the elevators/electrical/pluming with a outer \u0027shell\u0027 composed only steel. The core and the shell were only connected with beams designed to carry the load of the floor / occupants. He then showed us a structure composed of a bottom plate and a top plate (a fair distance apart) connected with only with small metal rods. As you can imagine it was pretty unstable, prone to torsional and compressive loads. He then added additional plates in between the top and bottom plate (think of them as  floors) and voila it was very stable. Anyways, that was the his attempt to show us the basic idea of the structure of the towers. \n\nHe then went on to explain that the jet fuel (which burns at a higher temperature than normal office fires) melted the connecting beams between the outer shell and inner core (similar to removing the intermediate plates in his demo structure). He really stressed that the impact of the plane did not cause the building to fail, of course the WTC was designed to survive a plane impact, it\u0027s happened by accident with other tall towers in the past. He said that it was designed so that the connecting beams could survive a normal office fire, but no one really designed the beams that support the floors to hold up to 200k litters of jet fuel burning. \n\nAnyways he then took out the intermediate plates form his little demo, and applied a vertical compressive force simulating the weigh of the floors on top of it. Of course the metal vertical rods buckled outwards eventually leading to failure. He said that caused an entire floor of the tower to drop down onto the next floor that was also weakened. By the time all of this hit the unawakened floors, it had enough momentum and force to buckle to next floor leading to a domino effect. \n\nAnyways, that\u0027s how the guy described it, it sounds logical to me. I was wondering if this theory was indeed correct / plausible as to the reason the towers fell the way they did.

Even expert intuition fails. That\u0027s why we do science.\n\nHow true! Thank you riemannszeros for that statement. Too many people think they know \"the ring of truth\" when they hear it. The WTC collapse *looked* like a controlled demolition, therefore it *was* a controlled demolition. But human intuition is fallible. Scientific studies have shown that the heat of the fire was sufficient to cause structural failure. But so what! Scientific studies have also shown that a lone gunman could\u0027ve killed JFK. Nevertheless people believe whatever they want to believe. \"Truth\" is, in part, determined by people\u0027s preexisting ideas of reality. If science doesn\u0027t support some cherished idea then the science is questioned.\n\nAn example of this can be found on the Creationist web site AnswersInGenesis.com here:\nhttp://www.answersingenesis.org/about/faith\n\nScroll on down to Section 4: General, point #6. It says, in effect, that no contradictory evidence can overturn their beliefs. OK, this is an extreme example, but all folks (including myself) are resistant to change heartfelt beliefs.\n\nThe real question we should be asking is why people *want* to believe the WTC collapse was a controlled demolition. But then we must ask *chi bono?* Who benefits from this criminal act?\n\nI think Trufers share this overarching \"big idea\": the US government is no longer a true democracy; rather it is controlled by a powerful cabal of warmongers, neo-cons, Zionists, military/industrial plutocrats etc. These people blew up the towers to expand American dominance in the world. They are so evil that they would kill innocent Americans to further their interests, and they are so powerful that they can get away with it! That\u0027s a scary thought. Our government and its institutions are not to be trusted. Our democracy is in danger. Our future is in jeopardy.\n\nMy own theory is that this is an anxiety brought on by the decline of American prosperity. Real wages have fallen since the 1980s, job security is gone, and a better future is no longer guaranteed for our children. The specter of a new external enemy, Al-Qaeda, adds to our worries. But the idea of a secret *internal* enemy frightens us even more. The demolition of the WTC validates our suspicions and affirms our fears: the US public is not in control.","duration":"","id":209,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_c0i4eeh","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":194,"links":[193],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"riemannszeros","label":"\u0026gt; I have a mate who\u0027s a structural engineer for steel and concrete clad factory units ( not dissimilar to the construction of The World Trade Centre )\n\nYou should tell your mate that the WTC was not a steel/concrete construction but a pure steel construction.

Every office in the pentagon has classified files. You need a security clearance just to get into an office there. So that plane could have hit anywhere and it would\u0027ve destroyed classified material. Take this fact (classified material was destroyed when a plane hit a building full of classified material) and add conspiracy and you get someone saying \"maybe someone wanted that classified material destroyed.\" And then you add internet, and you get: OMG Bush personally flew the plane into the pentagon to destroy FILES!!!!1Oneoneone!.\"\nIf they wanted to destroy those files, they would have shredded them and said \"oops\" if anyone came looking for them.

Instead we must fly 2 planes into the tall towers, and hope that falling debris causes a fire in WTC7 and makes it collapse too, then fly a plane into the Pentagon and hope that the fire destroys all the offices with those files, and pray that there are no back-ups of any of these files anywhere!

To be honest, I don\u0027t know how someone would tell them apart just by looking at them (not saying it\u0027s impossible, just that I don\u0027t know how to do it). [Also, apparently the colour of the molten material is dependent on the temperature, not on the actual material itself, still looking into that, but seems actually reasonable].\nNow, theoretically, if an airplane crashed into a building, exploded, and then the building collapsed (say, like the WTC), you would probably find molten aluminum under the wreckage (think of the wreckage as being like a kiln, trapping all the heat). Steel wouldn\u0027t be melted by that sort of event.\nBut, yes, Thermite can melt steel.

Sure there are eye witnesses who said \"steel\", but if I saw molten metal running out of a building, I\u0027d probably say it was whatever popped into my head first. Also, it\u0027s possible that those people who did see the molten metal and said steel were asked if they saw steel. It\u0027s a simple leading question. \"Did you see molten metal?

You pretty much said that in your first sentence, but then went on to give us your opinion.\n\nI\u0027m not trying to start an argument here, but none of us know what the deal is with the Minetta thing, and we likely never will.  Maybe Minetta heard exactly what he said he heard, but since that doesn\u0027t help people debunk a 9/11 conspiracy theory, we will just push that aside, right?  The same goes with the other anomalies in the official story. Many of them are just dismissed as coincidence or irrelevant by debunkers and this is purely opinion.\n\nWhat is interesting to me is that we are all expected to pretend that the facts, as presented in large part by the U.S. Government, are absolute.  That the evidence was not tweaked at all.  I\u0027m not saying it was, but aren\u0027t you starting with a foundation in your debunking that assumes all the information you have gathered in your studies is the truth?  The truth is, we will never know the truth.

Actually, there appears to be very little of that in this thread so if anything it seems as though perhaps Mr Reinmannzeros has learned from those discussions. However, let\u0027s allow for the moment that those discussions got out of his control. \n\nAs he mentioned from the outset for this thread, this is to be a discussion based on scientific approach. You can\u0027t ask him to prove a negative which is what most conspiracy theories consist of. You can poke all the holes in the official report, but without evidence to back your own claims all you have are groundless claims (which does not make them untrue...). The discussion in this thread his been tremendously reasoned and handled well by both sides. \n\nUltimately, I agree with him in that you can believe that the government was behind this, but currently there is no reputable evidence. There is certainly no evidence to support that there were explosives planted. No evidence that it was not a plane that crashed into the Pentagon. One can argue that flight 93 was shot down (although there is strong evidence countering that claim as well), but that does not support a government conspiracy for the whole thing. \n\n ","duration":"","id":455,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_c0i3wi8","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":447,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"fear_of_the_downmod","label":"One thing is clear enough:  Mr. Riemann is willing to fight.

The reality is that conspiracy theorists are ready believe something before they even start looking for evidence.","duration":"","id":460,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_c0i42na","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":457,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"retinarow","label":"I don\u0027t really have any questions, but I just wanted to say thanks.

He was also using the strain used to develop the Anthrax vaccines. Which means we know how to protect against it. Once it was realized what was being dealt with, the threat diminished considerably.

Infrared seeking, or Radar seeking? Remember, except for the new PAC-3 anti-air missiles, all current-air-to-air missiles used by the American military use proximity fuses.

But from skinny Muslim kids with no such training???\n\nGo to pilotsfor911truth.org.\n\nSir, you just discredited everything else you said with that piece of illogical nonsense.

There\u0027s not enough energy in the pancake collapse explanation of things to turn most of the concrete into powder. It takes a large amount of heat and explosive force to do that and fires were not present on most floors of the buildings and pancake collapse theorists deny explosions or controlled demolition. Neither dropping the concrete from high altitude or the floors smashing together could cause this so how did it happen?\n\n* The tower that got hit first falls second, why is it that one of them burns for 50 some odd minutes and the other for nearly 2 hours and they both collapse in the same fashion. Wouldn\u0027t they fall in sequence of being hit? The properties of the buildings were relatively the same correct?\n\n* Nearly free fall speed of the collapse, that boggles my mind. I covered this in physics class and a billiard ball dropped from the top floor would have fallen at nearly the same speed. All floors would\u0027ve needed to collapse simultaneously for this to happen. The pancake theory, allowing for even minimal friction would take 20-30 seconds for a collapse but each tower fell in roughly 13 seconds. How did this manage to take place?\n\n* Molten steel in the basement. The fires I agree would weaken the steel but the melting point for the type of refined steel used in the towers was between 2500 and 2750 degrees while the hottest jet fuel can burn for a period of time is about 1500 degrees. Though the collapse due to the weakening of the steel is plausible, the molten steel is beyond logical reason. Why was there so much molten steel present during the excavation of the towers post-collapse?","duration":"","id":603,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c0i3hu5","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"I am a debunker of 9/11 conspiracy theories.

What you should know, however, is that appeals to NIST as the arbiter of truth and facts is an appeal to unqualified authority.  \n\nSee my other posts to see how I described that elsewhere:  http://www.reddit.com/user/fallacyhunter\n\nBtw, I don\u0027t appreciate being called a \"truther.\"  I appreciate the implied compliment, but not the implied grouping me with a bunch of people who make logical fallacies all the time.  (It\u0027s really easy for people on both sides to see poor arguments and think mistakenly that the other side is therefore wrong.)  \n\nIf this were email or I had a page on the Web, I\u0027d lay it out quite quickly because I have typed things out methodically to avoid errors.  (Man, remember: THis is like programming.  It\u0027s easy to fail to pay attention to something when you are typing fast.  That\u0027s not to say I haven\u0027t already debugged this in a long document.  (Leave your email address if you want me to send it to you.)  \n\nIn lieu of being able to share all the information at once and in context, I\u0027ll give you this small amount of information:\n\nUS Geological Survey (USGS) authors Heather A. Lowers and Gregory P. Meeker wrote \"Particle Atlas of World Trade Center Dust,\" available here:  http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2005/1165/508OF05-1165.html  In a 10/29/2007 email, Steven Jones told me, \"They show images of iron-rich spheres -- but don\u0027t say these are \u0027characteristic\u0027 of the wtc dust. I called G. Meeker, he said that the iron-rich spheres were common in the dust.\"  The clearest picture of the spheres that I have seen on the usgs.gov Web site is here:  http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2005/1165/graphics/IRON-04-IMAGE.jpg\n\nNote: RJ Lee Group did say the spheres are characteristic of the dust.\n\nHere\u0027s a little physics tutorial for any who may need it:\n\nIn physics we talk about \"blackbody\" radiation.  The wavelength distribution of a black body turns out to be a function of temperature and nothing else.  Composition is irrelevant.  It doesn\u0027t even have to be the chemical properties of an object that cause it to be black.  A commonly used blackbody in the lab is a stack of razor blades, looking at the adjacent wedge edges.  Light incident on the stack of edges will undergo multiple reflections before coming back out, so essentially all of it is absorbed regardless of wavelength.  A cavity (made of any kind of material) with a small hole in it is black by virtue of multiple reflections of any light that enters, so essentially none gets back out.  A heated cavity thus will follow exactly the same radiation law.  The Exploratorium in San Francisco had a display with a simple 3\" x 5\" card file box painted black, with a hole in  the lid.  The question was which was blacker: the box or the hole.  Even with a light shining on it, the hole was clearly blacker than flat black paint.  When you open the box it turned out to be painted white inside.  Yet the cavity acted as a better \"black body\" than the chemically black paint, since it absorbed essentially all the light that entered.\n\nThe blackness of the body is significant because it simplifies things.  A black object is an \"unbiased absorber\" of all wavelengths of light.  The key point is that the same characteristics of a body that make it absorb light are exactly the same characteristics that cause it to radiate when heated (same process driven in reverse), so an unbiased absorber will be an unbiased emitter.  The lack of bias (of one wavelength rather than another) is what makes the radiation follow the simple, calculable radiation distribution law.  Therefore color is a function of temperature AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nMany real objects, even those that don\u0027t look particularly black, approximate black bodies when heated.  Therefore the color charts for metals at different temperatures will be close to, if not exactly the same as, the calculated blackbody radiation curve.\n\nTherefore the color indicates the temperature of what we are seeing.  The color indicates that whatever we are looking at is hot enough to melt steel.  If it was lead or aluminum, it was still hot enough to melt steel.  The simplest assumption, therefore, is that we are looking at molten steel, or possibly molten iron from a thermitic process being used to attack the steel.\n","duration":"","id":663,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_c0i3y2n","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":662,"links":[661],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"SuperDuper125","label":"Ok, I\u0027ve got an issue with that video.

(It\u0027s really easy for people on both sides to see poor arguments and think mistakenly that the other side is therefore wrong.)  \n\nIf this were email or I had a page on the Web, I\u0027d lay it out quite quickly because I have typed things out methodically to avoid errors.  (Man, remember: THis is like programming.  It\u0027s easy to fail to pay attention to something when you are typing fast.  That\u0027s not to say I haven\u0027t already debugged this in a long document.  (Leave your email address if you want me to send it to you.)  \n\nIn lieu of being able to share all the information at once and in context, I\u0027ll give you this small amount of information:\n\nUS Geological Survey (USGS) authors Heather A. Lowers and Gregory P. Meeker wrote \"Particle Atlas of World Trade Center Dust,\" available here:  http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2005/1165/508OF05-1165.html  In a 10/29/2007 email, Steven Jones told me, \"They show images of iron-rich spheres -- but don\u0027t say these are \u0027characteristic\u0027 of the wtc dust. I called G. Meeker, he said that the iron-rich spheres were common in the dust.\"  The clearest picture of the spheres that I have seen on the usgs.gov Web site is here:  http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2005/1165/graphics/IRON-04-IMAGE.jpg\n\nNote: RJ Lee Group did say the spheres are characteristic of the dust.\n\nHere\u0027s a little physics tutorial for any who may need it:\n\nIn physics we talk about \"blackbody\" radiation.  The wavelength distribution of a black body turns out to be a function of temperature and nothing else.  Composition is irrelevant.  It doesn\u0027t even have to be the chemical properties of an object that cause it to be black.  A commonly used blackbody in the lab is a stack of razor blades, looking at the adjacent wedge edges.  Light incident on the stack of edges will undergo multiple reflections before coming back out, so essentially all of it is absorbed regardless of wavelength.  A cavity (made of any kind of material) with a small hole in it is black by virtue of multiple reflections of any light that enters, so essentially none gets back out.  A heated cavity thus will follow exactly the same radiation law.  The Exploratorium in San Francisco had a display with a simple 3\" x 5\" card file box painted black, with a hole in  the lid.  The question was which was blacker: the box or the hole.  Even with a light shining on it, the hole was clearly blacker than flat black paint.  When you open the box it turned out to be painted white inside.  Yet the cavity acted as a better \"black body\" than the chemically black paint, since it absorbed essentially all the light that entered.\n\nThe blackness of the body is significant because it simplifies things.  A black object is an \"unbiased absorber\" of all wavelengths of light.  The key point is that the same characteristics of a body that make it absorb light are exactly the same characteristics that cause it to radiate when heated (same process driven in reverse), so an unbiased absorber will be an unbiased emitter.  The lack of bias (of one wavelength rather than another) is what makes the radiation follow the simple, calculable radiation distribution law.  Therefore color is a function of temperature AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nMany real objects, even those that don\u0027t look particularly black, approximate black bodies when heated.  Therefore the color charts for metals at different temperatures will be close to, if not exactly the same as, the calculated blackbody radiation curve.\n\nTherefore the color indicates the temperature of what we are seeing.  The color indicates that whatever we are looking at is hot enough to melt steel.  If it was lead or aluminum, it was still hot enough to melt steel.  The simplest assumption, therefore, is that we are looking at molten steel, or possibly molten iron from a thermitic process being used to attack the steel.\n","duration":"","id":663,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_c0i3y2n","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":662,"links":[661],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"SuperDuper125","label":"Ok, I\u0027ve got an issue with that video.

You cant proof there were no cameras and I cant proof there were cameras. The only people able proofing either way will not do it.  The fact that there is no footage available does not proof such footage does not exist.\n\nThe fact that there is no such footage currently exists for the public is probably the only fact we can agree upon.

For example there is the theory that the building pancaked, which I find believable considering that 1/3 of the building dropped onto the rest which the momentum would continue to just rip through.  The top 3rd would NOT stop on each floor and wait to fall, rather it would just rip right through and much appear like close to free fall speed.\n\nThe problem: NIST (or whoever) did a computersimulaton showing pancaking floors but then they dont model the center columns.

Why not shut all truthers up by showing a model with beams/columns?\n\nAnother example is the Purdue (?) university simulation of the plane hitting the tower. But those people forget to model the engines on the plane. WTF? The engines have the highest density and weiht on the plane. Why not model those or update the model once this is pointed out?\n\nIn the end there is a shocking array of incompetence around many details of the events and the investigation that is so puzzling.\n\nI.e. Good \u0027ol Larry states on TV that They pulled the building. WTF? is he senile? Give the truthers morte ammo? I give him that any conspirator worth their weight would have prevented that from being aired IF he truly meant they blew it up. But WTF, why say such things? \n\nI.e.

Again is that sign of incompetence, cover up of incompetence or conspiracy?\n\nMany  events (see the 2000 posts above) can be explained through incompetence or conspiracy and quiet honestly I wonder which  would be worse :(\n\nThe answer might be in this fact that when the commander in chief is told that planes are flying into buildings that he decides to freeze and do less than the 5 year olds that were around him.  \n\nAnother point for incompetence is the fact that someone who has dark skin, was reported as a threat, has a cash paid one way ticket and NO  passport can walk onto a plane just by saying.

You can just assume that what you\u0027re told is right, without even thinking for yourself! What convenience that must be.\n\nYou\u0027re absolutely right. Being rational is incredibly convenient. I haven\u0027t attempted to verify the existence of the Holocaust. I also haven\u0027t tried to debunk the Armenian Genocide or the Rwandan Genocide. I haven\u0027t tried to debunk the moon landing (an event that has considerably fewer eyewitnesses and would be far easier to fake than the Holocaust). Experts tell us there\u0027s an international space station in orbit right now. Is there? Are you sure? How have you verified it?\n\nWhen there is reported agreement of subject matter experts, I accept their findings. For example, I\u0027ve been told by doctors that too much salt in my diet is a bad thing. If a single study popped up proclaiming the benefits of a high sodium diet, I\u0027d likely discount it. But if other studies were done that confirmed its conclusions I\u0027d be forced to change my belief based on the preponderance of evidence. Actually, since I don\u0027t run a lab nor do I read scientific journals, I\u0027d rely on experts to tell me that the preponderance of evidence had shifted. \n\nThere has been plenty of time for historians to convince their fellows that the Holocaust didn\u0027t happen or the numbers were greatly exaggerated. I don\u0027t believe most historians have a vested interest in the matter. If anything, I believe that there must be many German, Austrian, and Polish PhD candidates who would be highly motivated to shed new light on this subject.

This misinformation floats around from the Popular Mechanics article, but no government documentation ever makes this claim.  Both the FEMA report and NIST report agree that very little structural damage occurred to WTC 7, and structural damage **did not contribute** to the collapse.\n\nThe official story by the final NIST report released 2 years ago is that fires ignited from the debris of WTC 1 caused the collapse of WTC 7.\n\n\u0026gt; Fires burned on many floors (of the south side) for many hours\n\nSort of.  I believe there were between 8-13(? not positive, doing this from memory, but if it is important I can check my sources) floors that burned for \u0027hours\u0027.  The thing is, NIST wrote that fires could only burn for 30 minutes tops in any one area, because there just wasn\u0027t enough fuel.\n\nDebunkers like to point out to the conpsiracy theorists that the reason steel melted/weakened in the Twin Towers (that led to the collapse of verticle columns) was that jets filled with jet fuel smashed into them.  Sounds plausible to me.\n\nWhat doesn\u0027t work is how fires got just as hot in a building that didn\u0027t have any fuel in it.  To \u0027deal\u0027 with this, the NIST report decided arbitrarily (or at least, didn\u0027t see any citations) that each \u0027area\u0027 (cubical) in WTC 7 had *50%* more fuel in it than the Twin Towers did.\n\nWell, that *still* wasn\u0027t plausible, so they decided to use a margin of error of 10% for their fire simulation.  \n\nTheres more, but the overall simplest argument against the official government WTC 7 story is that fire burning for a few hours in maybe a third of the building somehow initiated a systematic collapse that occurred at almost free fall speeds. \n\nI\u0027m sure I don\u0027t have to remind you that there have been *plenty* of high rise steel buildings that have been completely consumed with fire and not one of them collapsed.  \n\nWhen I researched the Twin Towers collapse, I noted this also, and had many debunkers quickly point out that the other buildings didn\u0027t have *planes* smash into them.  Well, thats a damn good argument, but it only holds for the Twin Towers.  WTC 7 is a honest to God mystery.

FFFFFFFFUUUUUU! \n\nAnyway, I was trying to state how some say the US is the best government in the world. That may be in some aspects depending on which area of government someone is referring to. Somehow I don\u0027t believe more taxes (or taxes at all), more laws, bigger army\u0027s, and more government can lead to \u0027a better future.\u0027 \n\nFirst off I believe planes crashed into buildings. I also believe in the blow-back theory, and that the government has some responsibility due to past actions they have taken. That\u0027s still no reason to kill 1000\u0027s of innocent people, but there is SOME responsibility on its part.  \n\nHere goes what I would like to see your answers on:\n\nSlavery - If the government can take a portion of my labor, how is this not a conflict with the 13th amendment?\n\nAlcohol - How can the government pass all these laws/statues/regulations if it had to amend the constitution to ban alcohol? Why does it not have to amend the constitution to do so? This may be a simple answer, I just don\u0027t know it.\n\nIs there a difference in income vs taxable income?\n|The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes...\nCan congress pass a law to require Canadians to pay US income tax? Of course not! So there must be restrictions on who they can tax. Who they can tax must be defined. This is what governments like to do: Make law into legal terms which a common man thinks he knows what words mean, when the terms are legally defined as something else. If we can\u0027t read and understand the law as they would interpret it, how can I cooperate until I understand it? Or should one just pay anything anyone asks of me, voluntarily? Can you explain how a contract is not required between governments and an individual?\n\nWho was the law (In general) written for? \n\nLaws written that obligate me (obligations for me to do something, when our government was created based on negative rights of not being able to force others to do things) before born or before 18, how could they be valid? Can I contract for anyone in the future, and who? I would like to get started on some of these contracts.\n\nThese questions are not in the \u0027conspiracy\u0027 field. They are meant more to point out that we should be working toward creating a better society that is based on freedom, right and wrong, and justice. Prison, or \u0027Criminal College\u0027 does not do much for justice or the debt to the victim, besides make them pay for it through taxes.\n\nHas a law ever stopped a crime from happening? Why do we not work on incentive\u0027s for good actions and dis-incentive\u0027s for bad actions? The free market does a pretty good job of this on its own. \n\nIf someone believes in sound money, that their labor is 100% their own, and that all government\u0027s are a monopoly on force, how would you view that person? I think I\u0027m a sensible person, I just have a real hard time believing in \u0027a means to an end\u0027 is correct.

True compression and oxygen flow can help, but this thing was burning orange hot for 10 weeks!\n\nAgain, you severely underestimate the temperature your basic office fire in a compressed oven-like enviornment can burn.

But there seems to be some missing thermo mass somewhere making all the debris hot.\n\nThis is one of those ideas where a solution APPEARS more plausible than it is. The energy density of thermite sucks. It simply doesn\u0027t produce anywhere NEAR the order of magnitude energy that, for example, your basic office fire would. And therefore even if there was thermite, it is CERTAIN, it provided only a fraction of the energy as the normal combustibles.\n\nIn other words, if the normal fire can\u0027t create that heat, neither can thermite.\n\n\u0026gt; And secondly, The actual fall of the towers.

The collapse of the building, seen in numerous videos, is \r\ndescribed by NIST as the collapse of the \"facade,\" the hollow shell.  They have no evidence for this \r\nscenario, however, and a great deal of evidence contradicts it.  After the collapse of the east penthouse \r\nthere is no visible distortion of the walls and only a few windows are broken at this time. Had the \r\nfailure of interior columns propagated throughout the interior of the building, as asserted by NIST, it \r\nwould surely have propagated to the much closer exterior walls and distorted or collapsed them. (Major \r\ncrumpling of the exterior walls, by the way, is exactly what is shown in the animations produced by \r\nNIST\u0027s computer simulation of the collapse.)  But the actual videos of the building show that the \r\nexterior remained rigid during this early period.  At the onset of collapse you can see in the videos that \r\nthe building suddenly goes limp, like a dying person giving up the ghost.

You\n\u0026gt; haven\u0027t, yet.\n\nI\u0027m sorry that physics bores you but if you\u0027re going to play the role\nof expert you need dig deep and find some curiosity about the subject\nmater you\u0027re trying to claim knowledge of.\n\nI don\u0027t have to read beyond the simple statements that you have \nsent to me to know that you aren\u0027t capable of debunking anything,\n\nOk, here goes some more typing that I hope won\u0027t bore you too much.\n\nThis might be a bit hard for you to understand as there is some\nsubtlety to this that takes some study to understand.\n\nThere are 2 forms or resistance that come into play here :\n\n#1) The resistance that you are focusing on, the steel columns\nthat support the the building. \n\n#2) The inertial resistance of the mass that is the construction\nmaterial itself.\n\nThere are 2 general categories of collisions: elastic and inelastic.\nbilliard balls are the classic example of an elastic collision where\nas an inelastic collision would be of the nature of a moving car\ncrashing into another car (motionless), getting stuck together.\n\nWhen the moving car hits the stationary car it must slow down because\nit has increased the amount of mass in motion (conservation of energy\n-- look it up).\n\nClearly in this case we are talking about inelastic collision(s).\n\nNow in order to understand the role inertia plays lets create an\nidealized \"thought experiment\" -- I know it must hurt a bit for you\nto do this but it is a perfectly acceptable form of analysis for\nproblems in physics.\n\nLets isolate the aspect of inertial by modeling one of the towers as\na series of blocks stacked on top of each other with just a little bit\nof space between each.\n\nOf course in real life you can have no space in between the blocks as\ngravity would pull the above block down until it hit the block blow\nit -- this is why you have to do this as a thought experiment.\n\nPerhaps an easier way to picture this is to consider the same blocks\nlying on their sides supported by a perfectly level and smooth surface\nwith zero friction between the blocks and the surface.\n\n(Now, don\u0027t give me a bunch of crap about how this is not realistic\nand therefore not useful. Anyone who has taken basic college level\nphysics courses will tell you that instructional/analytical problems\nare approached like this all the time. The problems sets they\nrequired to pass 101 level classes are full of these types of\nproblems.\n\nNow, lets put a magnet in one of the block on one of the ends and fix\na magnet to the surface at the other end and lets pretend that the\nforce these magnets exert on one another is equal to the force of\ngravity.\n\nAs soon as you release the block with the magnet in it the block will\nstart to move in the direction of the fixed magnet -- just as the\nblock would fall from an elevated position and accelerate at the rate\nof gravity.\n\nThis would be equivalent to free fall EXCEPT for the fact that it will\nnow encounter the other blocks (on the frictionless surface) as it\nmoves.\n\nAs the moving block hits a still block it encounters inertia,\notherwise known as RESISTANCE and will slow the rate of acceleration\ndown, the more mass it encounters the more it will slow down.\n\nEach time a new block is encountered mass is added to the equation.\n\n(We\u0027re talking MASSIVE blocks here).\n\nSo even without adding the resistance of the steel columns it is\nimpossible for the block to transgress the distance to the fixed\nmagnet (i.e. the ground) in free fall time.\n\nNOW, add the resistance of the steel columns and think about it.\n\nNow, I am very rusty at doing these types of calculations and will\nnot attempt it, but I have seen papers that do and it is clear that\nthe time the buildings took to fall does not jive with reality\naccording to physics.\n\nSo as you accuse me of being \"loose with terminology\" or using a term\nthat as you put it is a \"colloquial term masquerading as a technical\nterm\" and accusing me of \"pretending this stuff is actually in the\nlaws of physics\" -- I call BS and massive arrogance and stupidity\non your part.\n","duration":"","id":925,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_c0i5xhy","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":924,"links":[922],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"riemannszeros","label":"\u0026gt; \u0026lt;snip boring lecture\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026gt; Accounting from the obvious typos I assume you are stating that Newton\u0027s laws do not address \"resistance\".

They brought up the number and expertise, I put it in perspective. I agree that one well argued and well supported analysis is far better than 1,000 petitions. *They* presented the argument that somehow the petition was meaningful. So it matters if their 1,000 is a larger or small portion of the total number of architects and engineers. (And, at least, I gave the figure for the number of civil engineers, there is no telling if they restrict their petition to civil engineers, or if they are open to all fields of engineering.)\n\n\u0026gt;As to specific things you might want to see on their site, you could go for the first video on their home page, I guess that\u0027s a start: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dO36ReZixfiY\n\nDo you have some text? Video is a difficult subject to discuss. It take far longer to watch than to read the same number of words, it is hard to quote and hard to reference. \n\nThat said, I watched the first minute and it seems to ignore two great big issues. First, we see the building start to collapse *before* that \"jet\". Second, the support columns for the WTC were in the core, not the corners of the building. Taking the building down would not include putting some explosives in the corners.\n\nAt 1:45 they say that the \"puff\" moves with the building, but if you look all of the smoke exhaust is dropping with the building. \n\nAt 2:20 they show a graph: this is exactly why I dislike such video. If the thing is meaningful, then give me the graph (and provide the data as a download). I can make up any number of impressive looking graphs to seem to support any given idea. Having circle and colors and trend lines does not mean a thing. Do you know what they are measuring in the graph? Where they got the data? What it means? Or are you just impressed that some engineer has a graph?\n\nOK, at about 3:30 or so they are now telling me that there are explosions going off in the building *after* it collapses. I don\u0027t get how that is suppose to make sense. The building is already falling down, but somehow that was not enough, they had to set off more of these \"super thermite\" charges and somehow were able to time it perfectly so that the collapsing building covers up the evidence. Did that really make sense to you?\n\nAnd then at 4:07 we get what I consider the single most bizarre truther claim: the \"molten iron\" in the rubble. Think of the jet they were showing, think of how big an explosion (or thermite melting) was be needed to do that. Then think of size of that great big building falling down. How are those relatively tiny explosions going to somehow cause those small jet of dust, yet lead to large chunks of molten steel that stays so hot for days? It makes no sense at all to connect the claimed charges with the claimed molten steel. The one could not have caused the other.\n\n","duration":"","id":962,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_c0i71p8","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":961,"links":[960],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"wabbitsdo","label":"I was pointing out the \"architect and engineers part\".

They brought up the number and expertise, I put it in perspective. I agree that one well argued and well supported analysis is far better than 1,000 petitions. *They* presented the argument that somehow the petition was meaningful. So it matters if their 1,000 is a larger or small portion of the total number of architects and engineers. (And, at least, I gave the figure for the number of civil engineers, there is no telling if they restrict their petition to civil engineers, or if they are open to all fields of engineering.)\n\n\u0026gt;As to specific things you might want to see on their site, you could go for the first video on their home page, I guess that\u0027s a start: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dO36ReZixfiY\n\nDo you have some text? Video is a difficult subject to discuss. It take far longer to watch than to read the same number of words, it is hard to quote and hard to reference. \n\nThat said, I watched the first minute and it seems to ignore two great big issues. First, we see the building start to collapse *before* that \"jet\". Second, the support columns for the WTC were in the core, not the corners of the building. Taking the building down would not include putting some explosives in the corners.\n\nAt 1:45 they say that the \"puff\" moves with the building, but if you look all of the smoke exhaust is dropping with the building. \n\nAt 2:20 they show a graph: this is exactly why I dislike such video. If the thing is meaningful, then give me the graph (and provide the data as a download). I can make up any number of impressive looking graphs to seem to support any given idea. Having circle and colors and trend lines does not mean a thing. Do you know what they are measuring in the graph? Where they got the data? What it means? Or are you just impressed that some engineer has a graph?\n\nOK, at about 3:30 or so they are now telling me that there are explosions going off in the building *after* it collapses. I don\u0027t get how that is suppose to make sense. The building is already falling down, but somehow that was not enough, they had to set off more of these \"super thermite\" charges and somehow were able to time it perfectly so that the collapsing building covers up the evidence. Did that really make sense to you?\n\nAnd then at 4:07 we get what I consider the single most bizarre truther claim: the \"molten iron\" in the rubble. Think of the jet they were showing, think of how big an explosion (or thermite melting) was be needed to do that. Then think of size of that great big building falling down. How are those relatively tiny explosions going to somehow cause those small jet of dust, yet lead to large chunks of molten steel that stays so hot for days? It makes no sense at all to connect the claimed charges with the claimed molten steel. The one could not have caused the other.\n\n","duration":"","id":962,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_c0i71p8","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":961,"links":[960],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"wabbitsdo","label":"I was pointing out the \"architect and engineers part\".

I got involved, got worn out, and mostly stopped. I hang around reddit and decided to \"unretire\" just for this post. \n\nIt is true that there is alot I don\u0027t know. Most people focus on the MIHOP issues which are easily disprovable and are what I know the most about. I\u0027ve done very little digging on the LIHOP side of things.\n\n\u0026gt; So what do you get out of it?\n\nFirst, I learn alot. You learn a tremendous amount convincing yourself they are wrong. But I go one step further and actually engage them.... that requires a careful explanation.\n\nI view it in the light of greater skepticism. It\u0027s the same reason I argue with creationists. It\u0027s about how I believe psuedoscience is dangerous.

In fact, we\u0027ve only been able to see four frames with no clear view as to what it is we\u0027re looking at? [This](http://www.freedomfiles.org/war/Cnn%5B1%5D.Pentagon.Jamie.Mcintyre.swf) is an interesting video from CNN on the scene moments after the \"crash.\"\n\nFBI claim that over 84 video cameras show ZERO evidence of a plane crashing into the Pentagon. That\u0027s a lot of camera footage and not even one image of the plane skipping across the ground into the Pentagon. \n\nRemember, I\u0027m talking about a Boeing 757 airliner, these things aren\u0027t able to dissolve, in fact not one test has been able to duplicate what the official line is regarding the plane and it\u0027s disappearance into nothingness. Well there has been one other plane in history to do the same thing, that plane went down in a field in Pennsylvania; Flight 93 and totally disintegrated across 8 miles of land. One more thing, even though both towers were struck and they both collapsed and all of the fire and heat and debris tumbled atop of each others in a mass of destruction and devastation, both planes engines were recovered. Strange how they can go through all of that destruction and still be intact and identifiable, yet the Pentagon has nothing to show cept some sheet metal and a giant hole. Not even the grass/ground was disturbed. Strange. \n\n[Here](http://www.apfn.org/apfn/flight77.htm) is a very interesting study of that particular crash. Tell me how this is to be debunked then tie it all together into a nice package of \"Your Government didn\u0027t do this nor did they exploit it for power gain.\" ","duration":"","id":1002,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c0i3lv0","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"I am a debunker of 9/11 conspiracy theories.

Most people keep asking and do not know that every one of these -- as far as I am aware -- has been released. If you know of a video that has not been released, tell me, and I will retract.

Aluminum melts at a much lower temperature and so it would have been liquid long before steel. \n\n**Links**\n\n* [good collection of links to debunking sites](http://forums.randi.org/local_links.php?catid\u003d18)\n* [good wiki style list of common claims](http://www.debunk911myths.org/topics/Main_Page)\n* [extensive debunking of various claims](http://wtc7lies.googlepages.com/)\n\n**updates**\n\n1.
