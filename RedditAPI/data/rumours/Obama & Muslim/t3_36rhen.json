She is beautiful, athletic and honestly the smartest girl I know.  She plans to go to Duke and I plan to go to West Point.   I plan to date this girl through college and hopefully beyond.  We are both virgins and juniors in High School in good old USA.  My mother is *very* conservative.  Like believes Obama was born in Kenya and is a communist Muslim.  She believes whatever the party believes and backs it up with the \"you\u0027re too young to understand card\". She also has a tendency to scream and yell when confronted.  For example when I told her I supported net neutrality and said that it would damage the way we communicate and life, she started yelling about how I haven\u0027t done my research and I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m talking about.\n\nThe problem stems from my mother discovering through my father that my girlfriend and I are semi-sexually active.  This is her first relationship and my first sexual one (others stopped at touching).  The most we\u0027ve done is blowjobs and fingering.  We are comfortable where we are sexually and have chosen not to move past it for the time being.  I also believe that living with your SO before marriage is a must for a number of reasons.  Mainly because after seeing how much and badly my parents argue I feel like living with someone helps you see how they really are.   \n\nMy problem started when my mom began making very overt comments about how she \"knows what [my girlfriend and I] do in her basement\"  she tries to make me uncomfortable by bringing it up in front of my younger siblings and using phrases such as \"do we want me to tell them how she services you\". That word, services,  really bothers me especially because that\u0027s not something a girlfriend does.  A hooker services you, there\u0027s no love or affection in it.  \n\nHowever the point of this post was what she said last night.  Offhandedly she mentioned how my gf was \"not a good girl\".
