Now, I\u0027m not sure how many of you are American and I am not sure how many of you keep up with our politics. If you do not know there have been a lot of criticisms of President Obama, of course there are some that are legitimate. One criticism that came up even before he took office, when he was just a senator running for presidency is that he was actually Muslim. Of course, another criticism was his choice in a Christian church, which would seem to a contradiction. \n\nSome of this may stem from his attending a Muslim school in Indonesia as a boy. There is a name for it I have heard of, but cannot recall. There are pictures of him meeting with different leaders in predominantly Muslim countries always purporting that he is doing something to make his allegiance to Islam and dedication to Allah known. \n\nI must state that while I don\u0027t believe he is Muslim, I don\u0027t think he is strongly religious at all but he is at least somewhat Christian, I would not have a problem. People use Muslim like it would be an insult or as though one cannot be a \"real\" American if one is Muslim. This is ridiculous and most Americans feel this way, but a vocal minority is very anti-Islam.\n\nI was wondering, however, if there were any Muslims who felt \"yeah, he is actually one of us\". So, do any of you think President Obama is a Muslim like yourselves?\n\nThanks for any answers and have a great day!","selftextHTML":"\u0026lt;!-- SC_OFF --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div class\u003d\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Good morning!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I come to you with a question as a non-Muslim.
