Funny, I thought they were Native American Indians.\nWere those Muslims that celebrated the first Thanksgiving day?   Sorry again, those were Pilgrims and Native American Indians.\nCan you show me one Muslim signature on the: United States Constitution?\nDeclaration of Independence ?\nBill of Rights?\nDidn\u0027t think so.\nDid Muslims fight for this country\u0027s freedom from England ?  No.\n\nDid Muslims fight during the Civil War to free the slaves in America ?   No, they did not.\nIn fact, Muslims to this day are still the largest traffickers in human slavery.   Your own half-brother, a devout Muslim, still advocates slavery himself, even though Muslims of Arabic descent refer to black Muslims as \"pug nosed slaves.\"  Says a lot of what the Muslim world really thinks of your family\u0027s \"rich Islamic heritage,\" doesn\u0027t it Mr. Obama?\n\nWhere were Muslims during the Civil Rights era of this country?\nNot present.\nThere are no pictures or media accounts of Muslims walking side by side with Martin Luther King, Jr. or helping to advance the cause of Civil Rights.\n\nWhere were Muslims during this country\u0027s Woman\u0027s Suffrage era?\nAgain, not present. In fact, devout Muslims demand that women are subservient to men in the Islamic culture.   So much so, that often they are beaten for not wearing the \u0027hajib\u0027 or for talking to a man who is not a direct family member or their husband.   Yep, the Muslims are all for women\u0027s rights, aren\u0027t they?\n\nWhere were Muslims during World War II?\nThey were aligned with Adolf Hitler. The Muslim grand mufti himself met with Adolf Hitler, reviewed the troops and accepted support from the Nazi\u0027s in killing Jews.\nFinally, Mr. Obama, where were Muslims on Sept. 11th, 2001?\nIf they weren\u0027t flying planes into the World Trade Center , the Pentagon or a field in Pennsylvania killing nearly 3,000 people on our own soil, they were rejoicing in the Middle East .   No one can dispute the pictures shown from all parts of the Muslim world celebrating on CNN, Fox News, MSNBC and other cable news network\u0027s that day.  Strangely, the very \"moderate\" Muslims who\u0027s asses you bent over backwards to kiss in Cairo, Egypt on June 4th were stone cold silent post 9-11.   To many Americans, their silence has meant approval for the acts of that day.\n\nAnd THAT, Mr. Obama, is the \"rich heritage\" Muslims have here in America ...\nOh, I\u0027m sorry, I forgot to mention the Barbary Pirates.  They were Muslims.\n\nAnd now we can add November 5, 2009 - the slaughter of American soldiers at Fort Hood by a Muslim major who is a doctor and a psychiatrist who was supposed to be counseling soldiers returning from battle in Iraq and Afghanistan .\nAlso, don\u0027t forget the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15.2013 was done by 2 Muslim Brothers.
