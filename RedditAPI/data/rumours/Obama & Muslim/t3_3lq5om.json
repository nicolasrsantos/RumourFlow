Never mind that this is exactly what Mohammed himself said multiple times, we now have a score of over +1,000 calling the boy a fraud.\n\n\u0026gt;This is a weird video.\nWe don\u0027t think the kid invented the clock.

You know why everyone thinks this boy trolled his school with an edgy bomb threat? Because that\u0027s what they do on Reddit.

I just assume it\u0027s a normal clock and everyone was overreacting. Then I saw on another news days later that the clock was a suitcase.\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;The whole school made a mockery of themselves for arresting the kid. But, this raises the question whether the kid intentionally doing this.\n\nSuitcase? More like this [pencil case](https://i.imgur.com/MRr0mlx.jpg). I know if I wanted people to think I had a bomb, I would remove the housing from a bedside alarm clock and put it in a pencil case. ISIS should put one of these on each plane and train in America - bring the country to a screeching halt.\n\n\u0026gt;Maybe he intentionally made it look malicious? [4th top]\n\nMaybe he didn\u0027t. See, equal amount of evidence given. But one opinion rises to the top, the other sinks to the bottom. \n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;WOOWOO CHECK YOUR PRIVILEGE BRO! [top reply, with a score more than 50% higher than its parent comment]\n\nWhat? I mean - wait what? They\u0027re not even trying anymore, it\u0027s just the Two Minutes of Hate. \n\n\u0026gt;So, they suggest a possible motive for this reassembly of the clock was to manufacture a suspicious looking device. The device would set off alarm bells at the school. The stunt would give the child\u0027s father a platform to speak to muslims and aid his political ambitions.\n\n\u0026gt;I think this is entirely plausible.\n\n\u0026gt;But... intentions don\u0027t matter when the reason people are upset is still entirely valid. The police and administration still made a lot of mistakes and outright ignored Ahmed\u0027s rights. [next top, fuck counting]\n\nIma break this down for y\u0027all. Here\u0027s what went down yeah. Ahmed\u0027s dad told Ahmed to bring a fake bomb to school. But *joke\u0027s on you*! It\u0027s not a bomb, *it\u0027s a clock!*. See you might think the 14-year-old electronics geek who was handcuffed and arrested was the victim, but actually it was the poor cops and school administrators who got punkd by this brown boy. Anyway back to Dad. So Dad goes \"Son, bring this to school, because I want to ~~give pizzas to journalists~~ use my 15 minutes of fame to become a politician. Now here\u0027s your pencil case, say hi to the President for me.\" Totes plausb.\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;This has been my exact feeling since this story broke. I\u0027m not going to pretend like I know Ahmed\u0027s motives (though political stunt seems far fetched), but ever since I saw the clock and recognized that he didn\u0027t invent or even tinker with anything, I was immediately reminded of my own pre-teen angst and desire to antagonize authority figures/see what I could get away with. I was interrogated by a police officer and principal in the 8th grade for vandalism I ACTUALLY did, fervently denying the accusations until the bitter end. ... This rant brought to you by an extremely jealous EE grad student. [top reply]\n\nWell at least he admitted he was just jealous. So actual petty criminals are admitting actual petty crime, but somehow Mohammed is the guilty one. Remember earlier I said projection? This is cinema-grade stuff.\n\n\u0026gt;\"My hobby is to invent stuff and I do a lot of stuff for example inventing this type of stuff, right here transformers, you get what im saying, but I made a clock..\"\nHe doesnt want to show or talk about his other inventions which is strange, you think he would want to show off actual inventions he made but he always goes back to his clock bomb. [6th top]\n\nWeird how this 14-year-old wasn\u0027t as clear and charismatic as George Clooney was when he was interviewed on TV. Kid must be guilty. Our commenter continues:\n\n\u0026gt;I think he knew it looked like a movie bomb and thats what he wanted. ... When I was young I wouldve thought it would be cool to make a bomb looking clock and play at home with it with my friends pretending it was a bomb.\n\nGimme a P! Gimme an R! Gimme an O! What does it spell? PRO-JERK-TION!\n\n\u0026gt;The screen is also on the inside, my guess is he was inspired by COD bombs   because it would look all \"bomby\" with the wires and everything looking exposed.\n\nTotally just wanted to make it look all bomby and all. I play Call of Duty, he must play Call of Duty. Case closed.\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Ahmed is going to be spending a lot of late nights learning electronics to catch up to his reputation! Fake it \u0027til you make it.\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Dont worry. The media and all those companies who sent him tweets will make good on that for him. Then he\u0027ll be painted as an entrepeneur and us peasants will be told what it\u0027s possible to do with just a \u0027little hard work and determination\u0027...\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;I fucking hate this planet.\n\nAre the Two Minutes of Fucking Hate over yet? He\u0027s just a faker, and from his *privilege* he will get good, and leave me behind. Life\u0027s not fair. Why hasn\u0027t the President invited me to dinner? Where\u0027s *my* trophy? \n\nRemember a while ago the \u0027woowoo x ur privlej\u0027 crap? Ha ha, over-sensitive Ess-Jay-Dubya\u0027s rite? Well what is this guy now complaining about? Privilege. His entire comment is just \u0027Check your privilege, Ahmed\u0027. \u0027You\u0027re not an inventor, you\u0027re not better than me, you\u0027re just privileged.\u0027 I guess we only hate it when women say it. But we\u0027re allowed to say it when it suits us. K? K.\n\nThere are so very many more comments like these, some of which are gilded, so I shall just quote the one that typifies them all:\n\n\u0026gt;I wish I was discriminated against so I could meet the president and join NASA. [+150]\n\n\u0027Stupid minorities. So lucky that they get discriminated against. So privileged.\u0027\n\nSo what;s going in here? First Reddit loves the boy, but by the end they hate him. I\u0027m old, so I\u0027ll explain.\n\nReddit is smug. It is also insecure. It wants to be superior to everyone. At first everyone on Reddit sided with Ahmed because it allowed them to pull down the teachers, the police, basically the authorities. Reddit likes to be counter-culture. But then Ahmed Mohammed became mainstream, with support from even President Obama. This is when Reddit\u0027s [second option bias](https://np.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/yngzi/reddits_strange_affinity_for_socialism_how/c5x6adc) shifted towards disliking the boy. \n\nThink of a wine critic. If the critic says he likes the wine, he might be seen as a know-nothing child, who likes every fizzy pop they taste. But if he says the wine isn\u0027t good enough for his refined palate, then he is superior to the winemaker. Reddit pulled this boy down so they could feel superior to him, because for all their brave talk, they are suffering from a deep superiority complex. First they pulled down the teachers and cops, but as soon as they realised that they were in agreement with the majority, they blamed the victim, so they could show how smart and free-thinking they are. \n\nThe good that came out of this situation is public awareness that it is racist to arrest Muslims for having an interest in electronics, because Muslims aren\u0027t terrorists. And Reddit got that message, but flushed it straight down the toilet, just so they could feel superior to a skinny science geek in glasses, because that is just how insecure their fragile little egos are.\n\n#######istandwithahmed","selftextHTML":"\u0026lt;!-- SC_OFF --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div class\u003d\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A 9th-grader was handcuffed, arrested, fingerprinted, and interrogated without his parents for bringing the insides of a digital alarm clock to school, which his teacher mistook for a bomb.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href\u003d\"https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3l5qsv/ahmed_mohammed_texas_9th_grader_arrested_because/\"\u0026gt;Ahmed Mohammed, Texas 9th grader, arrested because he made a homemade clock and his teachers thought \u0026amp;quot;it looked like a bomb\u0026amp;quot;.\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href\u003d\"https://i.imgur.com/sfhWiOs.jpg\"\u0026gt;pic\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Kid\u0026amp;#39;s wearing a NASA shirt, too.

See you might think the 14-year-old electronics geek who was handcuffed and arrested was the victim, but actually it was the poor cops and school administrators who got punkd by this brown boy. Anyway back to Dad. So Dad goes \u0026amp;quot;Son, bring this to school, because I want to \u0026lt;del\u0026gt;give pizzas to journalists\u0026lt;/del\u0026gt; use my 15 minutes of fame to become a politician.

I\u0026amp;#39;m not going to pretend like I know Ahmed\u0026amp;#39;s motives (though political stunt seems far fetched), but ever since I saw the clock and recognized that he didn\u0026amp;#39;t invent or even tinker with anything, I was immediately reminded of my own pre-teen angst and desire to antagonize authority figures/see what I could get away with. I was interrogated by a police officer and principal in the 8th grade for vandalism I ACTUALLY did, fervently denying the accusations until the bitter end. ...

K.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;There are so very many more comments like these, some of which are gilded, so I shall just quote the one that typifies them all:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I wish I was discriminated against so I could meet the president and join NASA.

So privileged.\u0026amp;#39;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So what;s going in here? First Reddit loves the boy, but by the end they hate him. I\u0026amp;#39;m old, so I\u0026amp;#39;ll explain.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Reddit is smug. It is also insecure. It wants to be superior to everyone. At first everyone on Reddit sided with Ahmed because it allowed them to pull down the teachers, the police, basically the authorities. Reddit likes to be counter-culture. But then Ahmed Mohammed became mainstream, with support from even President Obama. This is when Reddit\u0026amp;#39;s \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"https://np.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/yngzi/reddits_strange_affinity_for_socialism_how/c5x6adc\"\u0026gt;second option bias\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; shifted towards disliking the boy. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Think of a wine critic. If the critic says he likes the wine, he might be seen as a know-nothing child, who likes every fizzy pop they taste. But if he says the wine isn\u0026amp;#39;t good enough for his refined palate, then he is superior to the winemaker. Reddit pulled this boy down so they could feel superior to him, because for all their brave talk, they are suffering from a deep superiority complex. First they pulled down the teachers and cops, but as soon as they realised that they were in agreement with the majority, they blamed the victim, so they could show how smart and free-thinking they are. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The good that came out of this situation is public awareness that it is racist to arrest Muslims for having an interest in electronics, because Muslims aren\u0026amp;#39;t terrorists. And Reddit got that message, but flushed it straight down the toilet, just so they could feel superior to a skinny science geek in glasses, because that is just how insecure their fragile little egos are.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;h6\u0026gt;#istandwithahmed\u0026lt;/h6\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;","domain":"self.circlebroke","gilded":0,"commentCount":165,"score":464,"upVotes":464,"downVotes":0,"created":1.442814835E9,"createdUTC":1.442786035E9,"visited":false,"self":false,"saved":false,"edited":false,"stickied":false,"nsfw":false,"hidden":false,"clicked":false,"kind":"t3","identifier":"3lq5om","fullName":"t3_3lq5om"}],"sankeyNodes":[],"sentiments":[]}
