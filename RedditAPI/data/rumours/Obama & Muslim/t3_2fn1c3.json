Everything. They have filibustered more than any congress in history. Despite that he passed one of the most sweeping changes to our health care system EVER. It isn\u0027t perfect, it isn\u0027t single payer, but it\u0027s a start.

Major financial firms collapsed, and the economy, now based on paper, not  manufacturing prowess and a middle class of consumers, was close to collapse as well. \n\nFast forward to 2014 and the economy is growing. The unemployment rate in my state is 4.5%, he single handedly saved GM which is now growing and building great cars in America once again. \n\nHonestly, in our 24 hour news cycle and hyper short attention span era, I don\u0027t think people have really sat back and analyzed what a great job he\u0027s done despite the complete lack of support from congress. I think that history will look back at his term as one of the best in history. I truly do. \n\nHe saved GM, he stopped the economic spiral by infusing capital when no one else could. He ended both wars, but is keeping a presence in each country (which seems to be the American way, ask Germany), he is attacking Al Qaeda and ISIS the way you attack a group that doesn\u0027t function under borders or with uniforms. You use intel, tradecraft, etc. and execute air strikes or covert ops to capture a target if necessary. \n\nI would love to hear from a conservative on this.
