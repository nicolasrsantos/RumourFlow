He always tries to tell me things that I KNOW is just complete Fox News-y bullshit but I can\u0027t really argue with him because I don\u0027t have anything of value to say.

And while I am VERY pro-choice and completely against anything that involves making anyone a 2nd class citizen, he has the same stance as above to those too. Pretty much if it doesn\u0027t affect him, he doesn\u0027t care. All he cares about is who is going to help out our economy and he believes that Romney will do that. \n\n**EDIT 2:** You all are awesome.","selftextHTML":"\u0026lt;!-- SC_OFF --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div class\u003d\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Okay, so I don\u0026amp;#39;t follow what is going on with all the presidential candidates\u0026amp;#39; views and potential policies and stuff.
