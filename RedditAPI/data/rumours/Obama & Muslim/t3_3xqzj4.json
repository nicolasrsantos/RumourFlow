Never posted here but my wife (47F) and I are at an utter loss as to what to do about this situation. Our families have always alternated where Christmas is held every year, some years it\u0027s at our house, sometimes my brother\u0027s, sometimes her sister\u0027s, etc. This year it\u0027s (or was supposed to be) at ours. Until a week or so ago, when people started canceling because they\u0027re terrified of ISIS airplane hijackers.\n\nWe live in the US. All of us are scattered across the country so pretty much everyone has to fly every year except for whoever\u0027s hosting. So this year the first to cancel were my parents, in their 70s. Admittedly they\u0027re both getting a little senile in their old age and more prone to irrational thinking, but this is the most extreme by far. My mother told me she had \"gotten an email warning her about a big secret ISIS terrorist attack plot on the US coordinated by Obama\" planned for this week. She even passed it on to everyone else in the family, which is how I saw it\u0027s obviously a fake chain letter. I explained that, said it wasn\u0027t real and was just someone\u0027s sick idea of a prank. She either didn\u0027t understand or didn\u0027t believe me. She thinks it\u0027s real and that Obama is a radical Muslim who\u0027s overseeing ISIS members getting ready to take over every plane in the country over Christmas break and bomb us. \n\nNow if this was just my parents I\u0027d be frustrated but I\u0027d ultimately give up and wait for them to see nothing happens and it\u0027s not true. As for missing Christmas, that\u0027d be their loss. But the unbelievable thing about this whole situation is that nearly everyone my mom forwarded the chain letter to, including my brother, my in-laws, and my 20 year old daughter in college, believe it. I got a panicked call from my daughter this morning asking if I\u0027d gotten the warning about the terrorist attacks and saying I need to make sure no one in the family flies here for Christmas. She said she\u0027s signed up to stay on campus over break after her exams end today instead of flying home tomorrow. \n\nReddit, I don\u0027t know what the f to do. Our daughter is intelligent, in college, getting good grades. My brother and my in-laws are smart people with respectable jobs, maybe a bit conservative in their politics but never getting into this kind of far right wing panic about conspiracies and terrorists. This is just unacceptable to me. How do I get through to my relatives? How do I get my daughter to come home for Christmas like every other kid? My wife\u0027s parents still plan to come but only because they said they\u0027re going to drive 9 hours across multiple states instead of flying. Other than that, if I can\u0027t figure out what to do there\u0027s going to be a lot of empty seats at the table. And I\u0027m disturbed because I thought better of everyone than this. Help me out here…\n\nTL;DR nearly the entire family has decided not to come for Christmas because of a fake chain letter claiming there\u0027s going to be large scale terrorist attacks.
