Thanks for your participation thus far. We\u0027ve almost reached 2000 subscribers in just over a year! yay! And this week is Freedom Week in N. America! Yay! Fuck the British!*\n\nAs we move into the mid-term elections this fall, I look forward to some truly enjoyable threads. Let the fun times begin!\n\nNow, brass tacks: \n\nA little re-cap as to our purpose here. **We are NOT here to bash all conservatives.** We\u0027re here to point out what a silly place /r/conservative can be at times (okay, usually), and how poorly it represents \u0027conservatism\u0027 in general. Let\u0027s try to avoid being just another reddit liberal circlejerk. We have plenty of those already. It\u0027s called, the rest of reddit. :)\n\nNow, that\u0027s not to say you cant be a self-proclaimed \u0027liberal\u0027 and post here. Of course you can. It just means we want to try to avoid bashing conservatives in general. Not all conservatives believe Obama is a Muslim, nor do they all believe in walking around Wal Mart carrying a loaded AR-15.\n\nThe point here is to both point out the silly shit, as well as actually have useful political discussion. Let\u0027s aim for that, eh?\n\nWith that said, let\u0027s talk about  bit about linking to threads in r/con, and about NON PARTICIPATION in those threads. **Don\u0027t vote in linked threads**, up or down. Don\u0027t comment in those threads. PLEASE, for the love of Allah, don\u0027t create sock-puppets to troll their sub. It accomplishes nothing, and ruins the fun for everyone. It\u0027s like white lines. Don\u0027t  do it! There is PLENTY of dumb shit to point and laugh at, there\u0027s no need to make it appear even worse than it already tends to be.\n\n\n**Harassing/stalking mods**: Dont do it! We have a few users here who are clearly just stalking, harassing a few of the mods there, creating sock puppets, constantly digging through their submission history, etc. STOP! I\u0027m just going to start banning people who do this if it gets any more out of hand. Yes, we know many of the mods there can be incredibly difficult, but take the high road! (blazeit420!) You don\u0027t do anyone any favors by appearing as bad as they are. \n\n\n\nSo, moving forward, we need to cut down on posts based on stuff mods say in other subs. This sub is pretty much for posting things seen in /r/conservative, not follwoing mods around and x-posting dumb shit they say on /r/whiterights, or trp, etc. We get it, they say dumb shit. Once in a while is fine when it seems relevant, but let\u0027s avoid too much of it, okay? Thanks.\n\n\n**Now, to the /r/conservative moderators:**\n\nI would like to begin enforcing an np-only rule here (even though I personally despise np links). But I can\u0027t do that unless you guys build it into your own site, as well.  So, what do you say? Let me know how you feel, either by posting in this thread, or by sending us a mod mail. \n\nFurthermore, if you see people harassing you, let us mods know via modmail. We don\u0027t like it any more than you, and we\u0027ll do our best to address it. (Yes, even you, chab, you ol Sport!)\n\n^(*sorry my Queen, I jest!
