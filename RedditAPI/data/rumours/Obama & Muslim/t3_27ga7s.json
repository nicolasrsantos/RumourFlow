Feel free to tell me I\u0027m wrong and he\u0027s right if that\u0027s how you feel, but I\u0027m hoping you guys can offer some perspective into the evolution of conspiracy-mindedness, and whether he\u0027s likely just going through a beginner\u0027s phase before his beliefs mature, or advice on how to tackle debunking them with him. (I\u0027m not asking for the debunking, more like an over-arching strategy on how to get through to him.)

Obama\u0027s a Muslim.  Common Core is a nefarious plan to brainwash kids (or worse.)  Obama will never relinquish the White House, and will seek global domination... maybe somehow through the UN.  Sandyhook was staged, no kids were harmed.  9/11 inside job.  There are guillotines in Georgia or something, planning for some sort of culling and organ-harvesting (maybe FEMA is involved?)  Agenda 21 is a plan for mass murder.  Fluoride in the water is a nefarious plot.  Global Warming is a nefarious lie for *reasons.* He doesn\u0027t want to discuss any of this over the phone because the NSA is listening.\n\nSo... is this whole list common?
