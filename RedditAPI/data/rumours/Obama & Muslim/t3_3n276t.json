I have been living with them for a couple of months and I am at my wits end. My mother is a religious fanatic who makes Kim Davis seem lukewarm. As soon as I walk in the door to my house, she will start ranting about God. I am a prisoner in my home because I don\u0027t have the heart to tell her that I do not agree with her beliefs. As each day passes, I am becoming less patient and I have started to get into a lot of heated arguments with her. Here are some of her crazy beliefs.\n\n- She still thinks Obama is a Muslim\n- She thinks that we are living in the \"end times\" that was written in the book of Daniel and Revelations. Any negative world event seems to bolster her arguments. \"Oh there was an earthquake? That\u0027s because it is a sign of the end times. Isis just took over another village? It\u0027s because of the holy war that was foretold in the bible.\"\n- Videogames are a tool for the Devil to recruit people into his dark army. I shit you not. She actually believes this.\n- Anything negative that happens in life is because of the devil and his demons. She believes that there are specific demons that will cause certain catastrophes in your life. \"Oh you just lost your job? - That\u0027s because the demon of financial ruin is over your life. You need to repent and cast it out.\"\n- To contrast the previous point, anything positive in life is from Jesus. Jesus this, Jesus that. She cannot finish a sentence without mentioning Jesus. \"Oh you were diagnosed with cancer? Pray to Jesus and have faith for he is the great healer. The doctor performed a life saving procedure to save your life? It was Jesus who was guiding his hands.\"\n\nI am at a point where I genuinely think she needs some counseling. The problem is that she blames all of life\u0027s problems and issues on the Devil. It would be blasphemous to even mention the notion that she may have anxiety issues and that she may need help. In her mind, the only true answer to any of life\u0027s issues is to repent and pray to Jesus. I cannot get any logical points across to her. There are three factors that contribute to her fanaticism. She is stupid. Not the sharpest tool in the shed. She is stubborn. I have never seen her apologize. Ever. She is also very fearful of everything. These personality traits make it impossible to reason with her. I would like to get the fuck out of my house again, but I am in no situation to move out. I may need to endure her crazy rants for another year. How do I deal with her? Has anyone ever converted their loved ones away from religion? Is it even possible? Help!\n\n\nTLDR: Living with a crazy religious nut who happens to be my mom. What can I do to sway her away from her beliefs?\n\nEdit: Thank you for all of the advice, I read everyone\u0027s comments and I have decided to try my best to ignore her and get my ass out of the house.
