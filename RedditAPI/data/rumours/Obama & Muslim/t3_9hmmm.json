To call them bat shit crazy would be an insult to bat shit.\n\n\n.\n\n\n**Things Only a Republican Could Believe:**\n\n* Parents who don\u0027t want their children to pray in school are Anti-American zealots -- parents who don\u0027t want their children to listen to a speech by the President of the United States telling them to work hard and get good grades are noble patriots.\n\n* Peacefully demonstrating against the country starting an international war is treason -- showing up with automatic weapons to protest healthcare reform is democracy at its finest.\n\n* Any government official with a desk job should have every action scrutinized -- any government official with a badge and a gun should never be questioned or disrespected. At all. Ever.\n\n* Questioning the legitimacy of an election because the \"winner\" was selected by the Supreme Court is sour grapes -- questioning the legitimacy of an election because the winner (by the largest number of votes in American history) is really a Kenyan born Muslim despite all evidence to the contrary is being a vigilant American.\n\n* Lying about a blowjob is an impeachable offense -- lying about a war is no big deal, really.\n\n* Investigating a shady land deal involving the First Lady is a matter of National Identity -- investigating the use of torture at the direction of the Executive Branch is a partisan witch hunt.\n\n* Executing Japanese officers for waterboarding prisoners during WWII shows that we have the moral high-ground on human rights -- waterboarding prisoners of our shows that we have the moral high-ground on human rights.\n\n* Sitting two rows in front of Jane Fonda in a 1970 anti-war rally is an OUTRAGE! Shaking Saddam\u0027s hand in 1983...meh, not so much.\n\n* Anyone who questions the president during a time of war is giving aide and comfort to the enemy and should be deported...unless the president in question has a (D) next to their name in which case you should undermine them at every turn even if you have to routinely make shit up to do it.\n\n* Socialism, Marxism, Communism and Fascism are all interchangeable words that mean pretty much the same thing.\n\n* Anyone who abuses drugs should be locked up indefinitely...unless they are a popular Republican radio host in which case they need your prayers as they recover from the illness of addiction.\n\n* Health Insurance companies have your best interests in mind and anyone who thinks otherwise is trying to turn America into the Godless heathen nation of Sweden where EVERYONE in the country dies (eventually).\n\n* Obama is an atheist communist muslim who attended a radical christian church.\n\n* Believing that human activity could impact the global environment is crazy talk -- believing that an invisible man in the sky personally told George Bush to invade Iraq to fulfill Biblical prophecy is logically sound.\n\n* The verdict is still out on evolution -- but Jesus Christ returning in our lifetimes is a pretty much a given.\n\n* The media are unquestionably biased against Republicans -- Talk Radio, The Washington Times, The Weekly Standard, The Wall Street Journal, Rightwing Blogs, Fox News and NewsCorp are not part of the media.\n\n* The government should have no part in regulating multi-national corporations as they make decisions that impact the lives of millions of people -- government should regulate individuals by determining who they can marry, what kind of intercourse they can have, what they can smoke, how to manage their pregnancy and how to proceed with end of life decisions.\n\n* Communicating with hostile nations is a stab in the back to our great nation -- Reagan communicating with the USSR during the Cold War was Political Genius.\n\n* Iran is a mortal threat to our nation and anyone who attempts to talk to them is traitorous scum -- selling weapons to Iran and then funneling the money to start wars in South America is clearly in our National interest.\n\n* George Bush kept the nation safe after 9-11 (NOTE: the Anthrax attacks, the DC Sniper and Hurricane Katrina don\u0027t count. Also, the fact that 9-11 happened on his watch despite receiving a security briefing specifically warning of the attack doesn\u0027t count either.)\n\n* Social Security, Meidcare, public schooling, public libraries, fire departments, police departments and the US Military are as American as Apple Pie -- universal healthcare is ZOMGDEATHPANELSOCIALISM!!\n\n* George W Bush is a regular \u0027ole Texas rancher just like you and me despite the fact that he was born in Connecticut, attended two Ivy League schools, bought the Crawford ranch just before running for president, sold it immediate after leaving office and is terrified of horses.\n\n* The two guys at the center of the Watergate and Iran-Contra scandals are trustworthy voices in discussions of current national policy and should be taken at face-value.","selftextHTML":"\u0026lt;!-- SC_OFF --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div class\u003d\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So, y\u0026amp;#39;all remember that email that went around years ago called \u0026amp;quot;Things Only a Republican Could Believe\u0026amp;quot;?
