Nothing in what I typed earlier suggests that their formatting wouldn\u0027t change the moment there was a monetary incentive to do so.  Indeed, this is exactly what happened to MSNBC in response to the rise of Fox News. It swung left to become the station watched by those on the other side of the ideological aisle from Fox News. If the Libretarians ever became a political force, and a large market segment of the population, there would be a news channel that catered to them as well. \r\n\r\nThey do, in any case, have to deliver content so that people will watch their programming and buy what they and their sponsers are selling.

Herman and Chomsky outline five filters, interrelated to some extent, through which these events must pass in order to become newsworthy.\n\n**1. Media is a business**   \nHuge transnational businesses own much of the media - a fact probably more true now than in 1988 when the book was written with Disney, Westinghouse, and Microsoft bullying in on the news markets.\nThe corporate interests of these companies need not, and probably do not, coincide with the public\u0027s interests, and, consequently, some news and some interpretations of news stories critical of business interests will probably not make it to press.\n\n**2. The product is advertising**   \nSince advertising is crucial to keeping subscription costs low, media will shape their news away from serious investigative documentaries to more entertaining revues in order to keep viewer or reader interest and will cater to the audience to which the advertising is directed;\nBefore advertising became central to keeping a paper competitive, working class papers, for example, were much more prevalent, leading to a much broader range of interpretations of events (and thus more room for a reader to make up his own mind) than can be found by perusing the pages of the Wall Street Journal and the Boston Globe.\n\n**3. It reports on what others say, not reality**   \nMedia depend crucially on sources and these sources will inescapably have their own agendas. Reliability of information should be important (although it may not be as shown by the tabloidization of the mass media in Monica Lewinsky affair), but the press also needs a steady stream of events to make into news.\nThis leads to a reliance on the public relations bureaucracies of government and corporate agencies for whom some measure of accepted credibility exists and who will also probably have a statement about major happenings. However, by relying substantially on the statements these parties, the media becomes less an investigative body and more a megaphone for propaganda; independent confirmation of facts as well as interpretation eludes it.\n\n**4. Stories must either create successful drama, or downplay all drama**   \nThere are costs to producing an incendiary news item -- one which attacks powerful interests whether they be advertisers, government agencies, corporate bodies, or public interest groups.

Many people have an intellectual disease that makes them try to turn everything into a label, or force a tired label where it doesn\u0027t fit.  Most people want to hear \"its the x\u0027s vs. the y\u0027s!\" because that\u0027s cut and dried and fits into a 30 sec blurb on tv.  Still, I instigated, so I\u0027ll do my best to reply:\n\nThe most dangerous conflict in the world, by my estimation, is between certain tyrants of the business elite and everyone else on the planet.  Corporations are not the problem.  However, they are an idiotically unguarded tool that is used as a vehicle for exploitation by the people I\u0027m concerned about.  If a network tech ever left a backdoor open like that inherent in American and Canadian (and many other countries) corporations, they would never work again.\n\nThere is a subset of the rich and ultra-rich that have figured out how to game the American system so completely (e.g. Halliburton, Monsanto) that they have now outgrown national policing and are moving toward global economic domination.  They are economic conquistadors with no interest in beauty, humanity, or truth.  What they do is just because if it wasn\u0027t, someone would stop them.  Someone like their friends in office who are too dependent on them and too scared of incurring their wrath to ever say anything. \n\nThis is not a conspiracy, because those are automatically untrue even when they are true ([Tonkin gulf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_Incident), [Greg Palast\u0027s work on 2000 elections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Palast#Presidential_Elections)).\n\nIt is a banal conspiracy.  An uncoordinated group of individuals with similar priorities that lead to similar disastrous effects on their world.  They may know each other socially and have sub-groups, but as a whole they have no formal agenda.\n\nI anticipate someone will try to dismiss me as a kneejerk liberal democrat because of this.  This would be folly.  I no longer live in the US and I think \"republicans vs. democrats\" is a sick joke on the people and has been for a while.  \n\nI respect Obama, but I also know that he\u0027s had to cozy up to some horrible people to get into the game and I\u0027m worried what\u0027s going to happen when they call in those favors. (Patriot Act extension and expansion?) \n\nI am not an anarchist, a radical, a conspiracy theorist, or a reactionary.  I work in an establishment position that I don\u0027t want to discuss and this has given me a little extra insight, but only a little.","duration":"","id":90,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_c0dcdzq","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":89,"links":[86],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"metachor","label":"\u0026gt;ps If anyone still thinks America\u0027s most dangerous conflict is Republicans vs. Democrats, or mainstream liberals vs. conservatives, you\u0027re taking the divide \u0026amp; conquer bait, imho\n\nNot that I disagree with you (I don\u0027t), but in your estimation what is the most dangerous conflict?","duration":"","id":89,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_c0da76b","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":86,"links":[1],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"ideo","label":"Sort of, but here\u0027s the problem: the entertainment industry as a whole has a highly visible majority of liberals who represent it publicly.

But to deny the climate at the recent 912 rally or town hall meetings, etc. had an element of racism is, at its core, fallacy.\n\nI\u0027ll give you an example.  Say you ask me \"do people shoplift?\".  Your reply might be \"I don\u0027t shoplift\".  Can we logically assume that because you don\u0027t shoplift, that shoplifters do not exists?  No, that would be ridiculous.\n\nI have been hearing a lot of this sort of thing ever since Jimmy Carter came out and said what a lot of people were already thinking:  Racism still exists in this country, and some of the animosity towards Obama has its roots in racism.  It\u0027s simply a fact.  Proof?\n\nAt a McCain event during the campaign, a man toted a stuffed monkey with an Obama sticker on its head.  At a tea party in Michigan, a poster of Obama as a witch doctor was presented.  At the 912 protest, a poster calling Obama a \"lyin\u0027 African\".  People carrying signs saying \"we came unarmed (this time)\".  Limbaugh falsely stating that \"black kids get to beat up white kids, with black kids cheering\", when the incident was proven to not be about race.  Limbaugh playing the song \"Barack the MAgic Negro\" and calling him \"halfrican American\".  The woman who claimed to have been attacked by a black man, who later admitted she did it herself to cast black people in a bad light.  Any time you see a confederate flag waived at an anti-Obama rally.  The picture of the watermelon garden emailed by the mayer of Los Alamitos, the dead monkey cartoon, these are all racist things.\n\nAnd, much as you would like to deny, these things are systemic.  We\u0027re not talking about a \"few bad apples\".  Limbaugh and Beck are routinely racist on their programs, I know, because I watch.  Have you noticed that Beck\u0027s recent targets have been predominately black?  I\u0027ve noticed.\n\nA school in Texas restricted viewing of Obama\u0027s address to kids, then buses those same kids to a stadium to watch a speech by Bush.  The level of outrage was simply not present when Bush, Clinton, Bush Sr., and Reagan similarly addressed kids.\n\nOn a personal note, I have dear friends who live in Mississippi, a mixed race couple.  Their likenesses were hung in effigy from a tree near their home.\n\nAnd finally, view this:  http://pubrecord.org/multimedia/5191/revealed-party-march-really-about/\n\nI will admit that the folks in that video were cherry-picked if you will admit that it was disturbing that people spouting catch phrases, when pressed, could not cite any examples supporting their claims in their own words or on their signs.  That these people were present and could not support their own protest beyond a catchy slogan indicates that there are those who have an agenda, and are using reasons they don\u0027t understand to support their agenda.  So what, do you think, is their true agenda?  It can\u0027t be policy - THEY COULD NOT CITE ACTUAL POLICY.\n\nRacism exists in America.  It exists in greater numbers in the Republican party.

And further, I agree that better caution should\u0027ve been taken when appointing Van Jones.  How about that?\n\nIt\u0027s that Beck goes after them *to the exclusion of* whites, or Republicans, who represent far, far bigger corruption in terms of dollars.  And Beck\u0027s primary argument against ACORN is that \"we are funding it\".  What about those links I pasted above?  Hundreds of millions, most of them.  Why not go after them, too?  I thought so.\n\nAnd I can\u0027t speak of the undercover reporters, but yes, it was exposed two days ago that the female had a vendetta of sorts against ACORN.\n\nAnd no, there is nothing racist about blacks voting for Obama, any more than it would have been racist for blacks voting for Bill Clinton.  It\u0027s very widely known that the black population, by and large, votes Democrat.  Nothing new.  And besides, casting a vote, for whatever reason, is an individual thing, and you\u0027re perfectly allowed to do with your vote as you please, even for racist reasons.  But we\u0027re not talking about your vote.\n\nWe\u0027re talking about the fact that racism exists in this country to this day, that racism has been on display at multiple rallies and town hall meetings, and that there are those in office, and in the media who are racist, some latently, some overtly.  Cast your vote however you choose, that\u0027s uniquely yours.  And if you come to me and say \"I voted for McCain because Obama\u0027s a black man\", I wouldn\u0027t like it, but I\u0027d have no choice but to accept it.\n\nBut I do not have to accept the display, the overt racism, the utter lack of tolerance in the media, at rallies, or at town hall meetings.  That goes beyond free speech (yes, did you know there are limits to free speech?  it\u0027s true!).\n\nAnyway, you\u0027ve tried to use the same old tactic, roadworn as it is, to hold up but one or two examples as being \"not racist\", in an attempt to prove your point, completely ignoring the plethora of examples I gave to the contrary.

I know that sounds crazy but in 1993, most old people weren\u0027t on the internet. They weren\u0027t receiving 50 e-mails a day from their conservative buddies filled with misinformation and scare-tactics.

My father is 67 and I have plenty of aunts/uncles who send me the same stuff as well. I have probably read every single conservative chain e-mail that has been sent.

Wikipedia seems to agree.\n\n\u0026gt; One of the most prominent items on Clinton\u0027s legislative agenda was the result of a taskforce headed by Hillary Clinton, which was a health care reform plan aimed at achieving universal coverage via a national healthcare plan. Though initially well-received in political circles, it was ultimately doomed by well-organized opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, John F. Harris, a biographer of Clinton\u0027s, states the program failed because of a lack of co-ordination within the White House.[29] Despite his party holding a majority in Congress, the effort to create a national healthcare system ultimately died under heavy public pressure. It was the first major legislative defeat of Clinton\u0027s administration.[3][29] Two months later, after two years of Democratic Party control, the Democrats lost control of Congress in the mid-term elections in 1994, for the first time in forty years.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_clinton#Legislative_agenda","duration":"","id":194,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_c0d9svx","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":134,"links":[133],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"mthmchris","label":"To confess, I\u0027m a conservative.

But I do think we should remember that a few years ago we were lolling at pictures of Bush juxtaposed with ridiculous chimpanzee faces. We can\u0027t really know for sure if that specific protester was aware of the racial implications of applying primate imagery to an African-American - he could have been somebody who opposes the administration on purely ideological grounds and was simply unaware of the historical context of his statement. Unlikely, but possible. I think that\u0027s what makes the race issue so slippery, its too easy to deny, in part because the charge of racism has become so heinous, which is a good thing. In general I\u0027m beginning to think that these protests, to the extent that they reflect racial resentment, could actually be socially helpful in a way - if you think of it as the angry outbursts of a dying ideology, you can see that the trend of history has this kind of behavior becoming less and less acceptable.

That said, libertarians value, above all, a sense of ideological purity that would cause them to recoil against many issues I believe in (e.g. I believe in Keynesian economics and think that going back to the gold standard would be economic suicide).  I\u0027m reminded of story told by Milton Friedman about Ludwig von Mises:\n\n\u0026gt;The story I remember best happened at the initial Mont Pelerin meeting [a meeting of prominent libertarian thinkers].  We were discussing the distribution of income, and whether you should have progressive income taxes. Some of the people there were expressing the view that there could be a justification for it.  Mises was so appalled that he got up, left the room, screaming, \"you\u0027re all a bunch of socialists!\"\n\n\u0026gt;Another occasion which is equally telling: Fritz Machlup was a student of Mises\u0027s, one of his most faithful disciples. At one of the Mont Pelerin meetings, Fritz gave a talk in which I think he questioned the idea of a gold standard; he came out in favor of floating exchange rates. Mises was so mad he wouldn\u0027t speak to him for three years. \n\nLibertarians today are more like Ludwig Von Mises than Milton Friedman - they tend to think that everyone needs to totally agree with their narrow brand of Libertarian ideology.  They could perhaps get more conservatives like me to jump over if they were willing to make their party a bigger tent.","duration":"","id":222,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_c0dauys","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":221,"links":[134],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"TalesAbound","label":"Sounds to me like you\u0027re less of a conservative and more of a libertarian.","duration":"","id":221,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_c0da6ne","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":134,"links":[133],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"mthmchris","label":"To confess, I\u0027m a conservative.

Wasn\u0027t that disproportionally small given the catastrophe of the event?\n\nWell yes, it was.  But maybe it was because setting up shop in Rwanda, and then being protected by some international envoy, and getting a full crew to stay there, and then trying to secure translators and interviews with important officials etc ... was a very difficult thing to do.\n\nThe reason for lack of coverage could be because it would have been prohibitively expensive to do so, or nobody could get a dashing enough picture for the lead in, or the reporter overslept and didn\u0027t get his story to the copy editor on time, or the organization is just plain mismanaged.\n\nBut to state that there is a reasonable alternative that will exercise the roll of the fourth estate more faithfully is, I think, an extremely bold assessment and I dare say, impossible to make responsibly.","duration":"","id":251,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_c0da47w","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":250,"links":[249],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"detarmstrong","label":"Only Chomsky can do the Chomsky-like.

I have direct access to our TDs (Teachta Dála, similar to a Minister of Parliament in the U.K.) and by direct access I can not only email or phone them but meet them in person. I have met in Person the Labour Party leader Eamon Gilmore, Fine Gael party leader Enda Kenny and the former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern as well as several TDs. Our unique system of parliamentary government keeps it in check if you will. \r\n \r\nFor example, recently the government party currently in power, Fianna Fáil, decided to pull cancer services in Sligo the pressure put on the two Sligo TDs by their constituency forced them them to give the government an ultimatum, either you back off and keep the Sligo cancer services or we pull out of government. Well the government called them on it and those two TDs resigned resigned the party whip. This means that the current collation government may lack to votes to push bills through. This could mean a general election.  \r\n \r\nIt would be like several senators refusing to vote with their party, say Democrats, and then there would have to be a general election.  \r\n \r\nFor TDs to keep their jobs they have to work together, if a government doesn\u0027t work together it\u0027s gone. \r\n \r\nDon\u0027t get me wrong life isn\u0027t perfect here, we have our problems as well but they pale in comparison to huge rift between the citizens of United States.

Practically the entire country was behind him - saluting and ready for duty. Yes, the Left did try to derail his plans for Iraq - but they failed. And when millions (actual millions) of Americans came out to protest that war - - it was largely ignored by the media. But when 70,000 lunatics came to DC last week to protest \"Government Spending\" (which, let\u0027s be honest, is a euphemism for \"Barack Hussein Obama\") - they got massive amounts of media coverage and hours of pundit commentary. \n\n\u0026gt;Every tea-party rally has been aggressively championed, and all-but-sponsored, by cable-news giant FOX. CODE PINK was almost completely ignored (which, as a liberal, I\u0027m kinda glad about -- but I still stand behind my larger point). A couple went to a Bush rally wearing anti-Bush T-Shirts and got arrested. Guys standing outside Obama rallies openly carry guns and get interviewed by the media.\n\n\u0026gt;The heaviest hitters in the Republican party, and in the conservative media have loudly and proudly called for Obama\u0027s failure. Liberals who even softly criticized Bush were roundly shamed and called terrorist-loving-America-haters. George W. Bush, despite the controversial beginning of his presidency, was given the chance - - no, in fact, after 9/11, he was given all the unopposed freedom in the world to succeed or fail based upon his own decisions and his own performance. Bush EARNED his hatred.\n\n\u0026gt;Obama has not had that luxury.

But when 70,000 lunatics came to DC last week to protest \u0026amp;quot;Government Spending\u0026amp;quot; (which, let\u0026amp;#39;s be honest, is a euphemism for \u0026amp;quot;Barack Hussein Obama\u0026amp;quot;) - they got massive amounts of media coverage and hours of pundit commentary. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Every tea-party rally has been aggressively championed, and all-but-sponsored, by cable-news giant FOX. CODE PINK was almost completely ignored (which, as a liberal, I\u0026amp;#39;m kinda glad about -- but I still stand behind my larger point). A couple went to a Bush rally wearing anti-Bush T-Shirts and got arrested. Guys standing outside Obama rallies openly carry guns and get interviewed by the media.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The heaviest hitters in the Republican party, and in the conservative media have loudly and proudly called for Obama\u0026amp;#39;s failure. Liberals who even softly criticized Bush were roundly shamed and called terrorist-loving-America-haters. George W. Bush, despite the controversial beginning of his presidency, was given the chance - - no, in fact, after 9/11, he was given all the unopposed freedom in the world to succeed or fail based upon his own decisions and his own performance. Bush EARNED his hatred.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Obama has not had that luxury. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;","domain":"self.politics","gilded":0,"commentCount":967,"score":3461,"upVotes":3461,"downVotes":0,"created":1.253229884E9,"createdUTC":1.253201084E9,"visited":false,"self":false,"saved":false,"edited":true,"stickied":false,"nsfw":false,"hidden":false,"clicked":false,"kind":"t3","identifier":"9lijd","fullName":"t3_9lijd"}],"sankeyNodes":[],"sentiments":[]}
