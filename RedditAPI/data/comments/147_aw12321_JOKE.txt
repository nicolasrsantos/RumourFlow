Less than 20 comments in and somebody is trying to turn this into an abortion or gay marriage debate. 
Why does it matter? He's a politician, not a pastor. 
Just more proof that "religious liberty" apparently only applies to Christians. 
&gt; You mean, it has nothing at all to do with Obama's proven track record of lawlessness and deceit and outright lies?

What does that have to do with somebodies faith. Are you implying that only Muslims can be liars? 
Are you saying it's impossible that somebody who identifies as Christian is a bad person?
Again, what does that have to do with whether he is a Christian or not?
Obviously he doesn't believe those people are True Christians either. 
You mean he actually respects other religions and has a different interpretation of the bible than you do!? *Blasphemy!*
