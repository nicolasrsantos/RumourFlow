Everyone knows that 50% of Americans are dumber than average.
And I'm being downvoted by people who don't understand statistics.
Since the intelligence curve is symmetrical, I am still correct.
Because they can't call him a nigger.

Obviously it isn't as simple as that. But remember that there was a short period when some racists called blacks "Canadians". 
&gt;The research by Spee Kosloff and colleagues suggests people are most likely to accept such falsehoods, both consciously and unconsciously, when subtle clues remind them of ways in which Obama is different from them, whether because of race, social class or other ideological differences.

That's what a racial epithet is, pointing out that the person isn't like us, in this case in a bad way.
Yes, you're right. We differentiate people by any number of descriptors, not just race.
Get off your high horse, buddy. It was as much of a joke as a serious suggestion. Nobody is saying that the findings in the article aren't true for a large number of people.
