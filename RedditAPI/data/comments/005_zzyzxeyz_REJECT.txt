OP said "Can't wait for all the baby boomers to die out"

ALL means every single one, regardless of whether they're a Tea Party loon, your parents, or the creators of the internet. I certainly don't want all of them to die out, although obviously they will, but saying "I can't wait for all of them to die" is a terrible thing to say; it lumps in all the good people with the bad and is basically saying "fuck people over 50."

The comment just said ALL baby boomers, didn't say just the Tea Partiers.

The demographic he condemned was ALL people over 50, not just those that are idiots and know-nothings.
The use of the word "all" instead of "all those" or something else completely changes what the statement means. From reading his other comments, I don't think this interpretation is obvious at all.
Instead of "dulled" your respect, I would have said "annihilated."
