What's this 'international' you're talking about? We all know the world exists between the East Coast and West Coast of 'Merica.
Well, no. But Marxism as a politico-economic theory has existed for more than 150 years with contributions along the way. To a Marxist, the flaws, or rather contradictions, of capitalism are systemic and inherent. So yes, they think we will ditch the system one day, including the concept of capital and private (but not personal) property.

Don't be a dick and learn what you're talking about.
Fair enough. I just see fundamental misunderstandings on that particular topic everyday. I apologise.
Marx is considered an important contributor to socio-economics and dissects capitalism pretty well. Are you honestly comparing him to a Republican that calls Obama a Muslim?
Yeah man, that sucks. Have fun dealing with all those frequent mass shootings every other weekend.
Ever heard of a buy-back, fuckwit?
It's been successful in other countries but America is full of retards like you so I guess you'll have to put up with it. Give up and never try, right? You cunt.
Oh, that's nice. Why don't you think critically about the situation instead of whining like a little boy about how 'culture and mentally' stops even the notion of such solutions being entertained? You're not unique or special. You're mostly sheep that follow ridiculously bad laws already. It's your own fault that people die because of the quasi-deity status you place on some shitty piece of paper. 

'Merica. Freedom to have a gun to compensate for your small penis.
Your 'assessment' has no basis whatsoever in reality. You know why?

People are amazingly adept at following laws, even bad laws. If someone doesn't hand in their guns, you send police to arrest them. If they try to shoot the police, police will return fire and they will be shot. The threat of arrest or death will prompt people to follow the law, as it does for laws that exist today. Of course, there are legitimate causes for possession of one or few guns (if you are a farmer with cattle etc).

Secondly, the 'if we take guns from law abiding citizens, only criminals will have guns' is just tired old bullshit. Guns that fall into the hands of criminals used to be legally acquired guns. Bullets that fall into the hands of criminals were made in gun factories. If there is no legal market for guns, the supply to the criminal market will be strangled. That means the production of guns has to be outlawed, except for highly regulated exceptions (for farmers, etc).

With all the poor people in the States who own guns, who among them wouldn't want some money?

Now, all that would work. But it means getting over all the 'founding fathers freedoms blah blah blah' mythical bullshit. It would only work if you had the courage to do it.
Aw, thanks man.
I'm fine with being an idiot and not shot to death.
Wrong. Guns that fall into the hands of criminals used to be legally acquired guns. Bullets that fall into the hands of criminals were made in gun factories. If there is no legal market for guns, the supply to the criminal market will be strangled. If there are no more bullets produced, the guns that remain in criminal hands become useless.
And the biggest exporter of them all? The United States. 
Keep production strictly military and phase out civilian use.
&gt; **USA:** 
The United States is **by far the world’s largest arms trader**, accounting for around 30 per cent of conventional arms transfers in terms of value. Its position on the ATT is therefore key.

&gt;**Countries supplied:**
The USA supplies arms to **more than 170 countries** and has a mixed record of suspending arms supplies on human rights grounds. For example, it has restricted arms transfers to Myanmar, China, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in addition to countries subject to UN arms embargoes. However, it has supplied arms to other countries, for example Sri Lanka, Bahrain, Egypt and Yemen, where there is a substantial risk that they could be used to commit of facilitate serious human rights violations. 

&gt;**Irresponsible transfers:** 
As the main arms supplier to Egypt, the US authorized the sale of small arms, millions of rounds of ammunition and chemical agents for riot control, despite the security forces’ violent crackdown on protesters. Yemen was also supplied with small arms, chemical agents and armoured vehicles, and Bahrain with small arms. It provides Colombia’s security forces with arms, military aid and training, despite their persistent violations of human rights. 

&gt;**Stance on the ATT:** 
Since October 2009, when the Obama administration reversed previous opposition to an ATT, US support has been crucial in getting to the current negotiation stage. The US has said it wants the treaty to raise the international standard for export control of armaments as close as possible to that of the US. **However, the US position is weaker on human rights protection in the treaty than many of its allies.** For example, **US officials have not wanted to include obligations on states to prohibit transfers of arms even where there is credible evidence of their potential use for serious violations of human rights.** US officials have also argued against including ammunition under the scope of the treaty, claiming it is too sensitive and would pose technical problems of implementation. Overall, US officials would prefer a short loose document that spells out general principles to “take into account” rather than strong binding measures.

I like to think the military has stringent measures to ensure that its gun supplies don't leak into the civilian, and criminal, market.
Because water is designed only to kill people, right?
They can be used for many things, but they are designed for one thing. Comparing guns to water is stupid.
Knives were designed to have many purposes. Guns do not.
The CIA certainly is. And if you had an inkling of what the CIA has done, you'd agree.

Edit: If you don't believe me, tell me of an organization that has destroyed more democracies and aspiring democracies around the world than the CIA. And 'because communism' isn't a viable defence.
Kang? I voted for Kodos.
That Obama's a progressive.
Bush Mk.II
What else is Rudy Giuliani supposed to talk about?
I'm sorry I called you a gap-toothed bitch. It's not your fault you're so gap-toothed.
This is his trump card.
No hablo inglish.
