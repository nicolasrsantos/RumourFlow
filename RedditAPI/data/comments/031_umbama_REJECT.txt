I don't think so. Many a Muslim scholar might say that if you're born into a Muslim family, brought up for a while as a Muslim, schooled in the Koran and then become a Christian that you're an apostate and should be killed...
I'm saying that things are a bit more complicated. Obviously Obama's not a Muslim but some Muslims may *claim* he's an apostate. Perhaps.
&gt;*Your only a muslim when you believe in Islam*

My point was that if Obama was, as a child, instructed in the Koran and had a Muslim father, then decided he'd prefer to be a Christian, then he could be considered an apostate.

&gt;*Your either a practicing believing Muslim or your not a Muslim.*

What's the situation with all young children in Islam, then? The mentally deficient? The dead?




&gt;*Unless Obama himself choose to be a muslim and live an Islamic lifestyle when he was old enough to realize whats going on then he wasn't one*

Ok, so no children of Muslims are Muslims until they're old enough. What happens if they die young? Do they get to go to heaven?

Besides, I was under the impression that in Islam religious affiliation passes from father to son. Could be wrong about that.


&gt;*Becides I don't think he was raised in a muslim lifestyle.*

He attended classes in Koranic studies in Indonesia. But then, I attended French classes andI didn't end up French. Point is, though, that at some point in his life he was treated *as though he was* a Muslim. Possibly enough to make some idiots claim apostasy.


&gt;*Are American children able to make informed decisions with full understanding of the ramifications*

No. Then again, there's no call for the death of apostates.



&gt;*Where is the call for death? From the a person or from the source of everything that is holy to Muslims the koran? Because I know that in the Koran it says "There is no compulsion in Religon".*

And you know that Islam isn't only the Koran. It's the Hadith, too, and the history of Islamic jurisprudence.

&gt;*The four major Sunni and the one major Shia Madh'hab (schools of Islamic jurisprudence) agree that a sane adult male apostate must be executed.*
