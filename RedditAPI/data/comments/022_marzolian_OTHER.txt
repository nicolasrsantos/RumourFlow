Well, Palin was his idea. I was hoping he would do better in 2000 against W.
That's deep. But I don't see McCain as someone who would ever play that sort of long game
I think he had a hunch about her, but was proven wrong. And being a gentleman with a personal code of honor, he hasn't admitted it. That would mean being critical of someone who was basically loyal and tried her best. As a military guy, he knows that when someone fails because they are unqualified, then it's also the fault of the superior officer who selected them.
And to Hillary's credit, she dropped it once she realized it wasn't getting traction.
I'm not giving her much credit. It was cold reality. The people who would not vote for Obama because he was a foreigner or Muslim probably don't like her anyway, so there was no reason to pander to them. 
Dude, she's in it to win it. I'm not making moral judgments here. That's the way some people do politics in the USA. Rotten, I'm glad she lost that time,and glad to see that Obama didn't stoop to those tactics.   

Plus: her people didn't make it up. The story was out there already.

Plus: there's no evidence that she pushed it. 
I don't know and you don't either, how much she knew and when she knew it. I suspect she knew about it early, but dropped it. If you want to say she's a conniving scoundrel and dropped only because it might backfire, fine. If you say she dropped it because it was a lie and she was taking the high road, that might be true instead. I don't care. 
Given a choice between (a) someone who is powerful, mostly intends to support positions I agree with, and who will bend the rules once in a while; (b) a right-wing conservative who may be ethical in his own frame of reference but whose supporters include racists and will work to lower taxes on the very rich, who claim global warming is a lie; or (c) a well-meaning, scrupulously honest liberal who has no favors to pull in, and who will be opposed by a block of conservatives basically unarmed, I'll probably take (a).
I've been telling my friends that since he rode down that escalator. By Christmas most of the loonies will be gone and most Republicans will support two or three more mainstream candidates.  
And 9-11.
That was almost the high point for McCain. The economy, [repeat 17 times], Sarah Palin, and McCain's bizarre "suspension" of his campaign couldn't be overcome.
Yes, Trump should have refuted the statements. Of course, then he would no longer be Trump.
