My dad just revealed he thinks Obama is a Muslim and a nigger, also that IF I was going ot vote him he would disown me!  I'm really unsure what to say to this...
hmm what's up with the granny sex?
Well, I'm trying.  At first he was telling me not to even send him anything on "that nigger" but I just convinced him to at least read the snopes article saying Obama wasn't Muslim

So thats a start.

But it seems that almost all of my family is behind McCain, it's really disheartening.  My gma, my mom, my cousin, aunt, uncle.  Only my brother knows any better.

And we're from the southeast, the sticks, hickville... remember that crazy woman on the fourwheeler... yeah thats where I'm from.
Well our conversation got cut short, so i haven't gotten any more details than just "he's a full blooded American" and he would "be a good leader".

I said to him that McCain was a war monger and my dad said that wars are profitable and there would always be war.   Which is true.  
Well... yeah.  I forgive my dad often for his behavior.  



thanks
You think so?  I don't know... I would feel... dirty.
yeah my "s" key failed me... and I left it that way 
it was meant to say ilikerustyspoons
Who wouldn't vote for a such versatile fabric!
HA he's a witness.  raised that way but doesn't practice
I didn't say I was going to vote for Obama, I said IF I did. If I were going to vote it would be for Baldwin.

What I said to my dad in invoke this startling revelation was... If I had to choose between the two, I would vote for Obama over McCain
