The difference is that right-wing extremists have a major political party, presidential candidate, substantial representation in Congress, etc.
Some of this is BS, but some of it I think is just a shorthand for larger issues. "Binders full of women" is one example of the latter, IMO. Romney's overall response made it pretty clear that he doesn't think women deserve an equal place in the workforce, and that they need special treatment if you want to be able to include them at all. "Binders full of women" is not the offensive part of that response, but it's convenient shorthand for his whole attitude.
Why should being in the Bill of Rights give it an automatic pass? I personally don't see the big deal with gun rights and don't see why it should get lumped in with actual important stuff like the right to free speech and due process.

I understand that some people think the second amendment is super important, but it's extremely frustrating when such people try to shut down the argument by pointing out that it's part of the Bill of Rights and therefore we can't question it. I'll think for myself, not let a bunch of 18th-century aristocrats do it for me.
I see guns as neither necessary nor sufficient to resist government encroachment of rights.
I don't know why this is a sufficiently controversial statement to get downvoted. It seems pretty obvious. I mean:

1. Not necessary. Just see Egypt for an example of that.
2. Not sufficient. Just look at how the US government walks over civil rights with near impunity, despite a huge population of gun owners.
Seems to me that the proper solution would involve a better funded or more competent police force.
