No surprise there. I lived in Alabama, and while I met some great people (one of which remains a friend to this day), they have some serious problems. Alabama is home to one of, if not THE, greatest orthopedic surgeons in the world, and politeness is abundant. But you're going to hear a multitude of white customers refer to their black servers as "boy" and you're going to see a disturbing level of poverty in extremely segregated communities. 

The South has its problems, but don't disregard it as "retarded." The uneducated bigots are victims of impoverished circumstances and a racist society that have coalesced in making them easy prey for political forces that look to capitalize on vulnerable people with preexisting prejudices.
I referred to the politeness as distinctly separate from the racism I witnessed. Racism is inherently impolite. The two qualities of racism and politeness can be, and are, concurrently present in the same community/city/state.
It was in response to the idea that Alabama is just a town full of retards, which was the sentiment conveyed in virtually every top comment. Thanks, though. 
I'm using Alien Blue, did I make a typo? 

Woops in advance if I did. 
It is disappointing. And it just makes me angrier to see groups like Americans for Prosperity (see: Koch brothers) just exploit Southen states, turning well-meaning people into foot soldiers to combat their own interests. It reminds me of Current TV's documentary "Two Americas" profiling a Southern family surviving on food stamps and unemployment, who **oppose social programs like food stamps and unemployment.**

On another note, Roll Tide.
