I live right over the clay county line, and I can say that the majority of people I know in the area maintain this way of thinking. My history teacher actually said "Obama isn't black, he's Muslim!" 

To show her her own ignorance, I said "I'm not white, I'm Christian!" Which resulted in me being boo'd by the class. It was worth it. 
Tell me about it. Sometimes I think I'm the only one in the room with the ability to think for myself. 
No, it's a private school in the backwoods of the Bible Belt. Sadly, private schools can do pretty much whatever they want. 
Yea, it is typical of a lot of private schools. I attend this school mainly to play football because our team makes it to the state championship regularly, and because they offer an early admission program where I can take college courses while still in high school. 
I assume when you say that you went to one of the best high schools in the nation, you're referring to either Stanton or Paxon right? I went to Paxon for one year. Anyways, small world.
