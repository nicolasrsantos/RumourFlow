Well if you are blaming republicans for stopping the regulation of stocks and commodities, then the blame is correct.

If we did something to limit speculation in the commodities market, gas prices would drop by at least 30%, if not 50%.

Obama hasn't ran on fixing this stuff, but we definitely have no chance while the republicans who want to deregulate everything still have any power in government.
That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard.

Middle men can only raise prices, they cannot lower it.  By stabilize, you mean "stabilize the price as 30-50% higher than the normal price".
Middlemen provide no service.

Middlemen only work where there is a seller and a buyer.  That way they are middlemen.

If there is already a seller and a buyer, the middlemen provide no service.  They get in between existing transactions and either take money away from the seller or buyer or both in order to extract a profit.

A middlemen can never help anything.

&gt;So, when oil is cheap, they buy it and stockpile it. Later, when prices go up, they sell the oil. This increases the supply and prices are kept more stable

Are you daft?  They caused the price to go up when oil was cheap.  Hell, they basically caused the high price.  Their goal is to raise prices and sell their oil first leaving the original sellers with a double hit.  They lost money on their original oil and they lose again when that oil comes back on the market first and drops the price for any oil sold after it.
&gt;There is nothing inherent to their function that makes them "middlemen" rather than just market participants.

You are so cute.  When a speculator makes money, that means either the buyer got less than he could have, or the seller paid more.

Money does not come out of thin air.  If speculators commonly lost money, they would not be in the market.  So they must be making money overall, that means prices are higher.

It is that simple.  It is sad that you can't comprehend simple addition and subtraction.

&gt;Speculators can and do lower prices frequently. Consider that one way to profit in a market is to sell short when value is skewed right, thus lowering prices.

Not possible, the addition of middle men always raise the price.  If a speculator makes money on a short sale, that just means the price goes up.
God damn you are stupid.

If a middle man is consistently making money, that money has to come from somewhere.

Either the seller got less than he could have, or the buyer paid more.  Usually a little of both.

Both the sellers and the buyers get fucked by middlemen.
But dismissing religion isn't a liberal thing. It is just an acknowledgement of facts.

If you are religious, by default you are stupid.  Doesn't mean you can't be awesome, but it does mean you are supporting something that is really bad and harms others.
&gt;religious people are not by default stupid. 

Yes they are.

&gt;or are they evil.

If they support the church in any way, yes they are.
Oh dear, you consider facts to be militant.

I take it you are mormon?

I was also responding to others.  There is no reason for me to ever bring up religion, but if someone else does and of course is inviting comments, I will not lie.  What is wrong with you?
You can't be.  Someone who is not defending religion would never call someone a militant for stating a fact.
You seem to enjoy these words you invent to attack anyone who tells the truth.

You are definitely mormon.
Any organized religion that takes money and resources from members to spread ignorance.
&gt;has met intelligent religious people

Not possible, that is an oxymoron.
Projecting?  How?  A fact is a fact.
It is absolutely a fact that all religions are false. Do you have down syndrome?
Facts are not name calling.

If you think a religion could be true, then you have to have down syndrome.
So you think people stating facts invalidates their political views?

I take it you watch fox news as your primary source of information?
100k is not rich.  

200k is not rich.  

Rich is probably at the very least, making 300k or more in a year.


You are one very confused person.

Middle class is about lifestyle and means, not the average income.

The middle class is shrinking do to republican policies.  We could end up with no middle class at all.  Only poor and a few super rich.

I can't believe you actually think "middle class" is an average.  You have  no idea what you are talking about.
I know worth is part of it.  The income figures basically ignore windfalls and large net worths.  It is basically the income that puts you into a certain class assuming you have no windfall assets.

You just have your income and you live a normal life spending and saving like normal.

Obviously someone who writes a book and has millions in the bank is rich  despite not having a steady income.

We are talking about the average worker who gets their normal salary and nothing more.  We simplify so we can actually make a metric that is simple and applies to most people.

A person who make 500k a year has certain means.  A person that makes 100k a year has certain means.  A person that makes 30k a year has certain means.

That is all the metric tries to say.  Gives you an idea of the income you need to be at a certain lifestyle level in society.
Which is exactly my problem with people claiming 100k is rich.  It is basically low-middle middle class.
