I dismiss them on the basis that they lack the ability to think logically and act reasonably. 

It's not that they are bad people. It's that I don't think they have a full grasp on reality. 

After all they think the earth was created in 6 days and women were made from men's ribs. 

Furthermore. If they simply pick and choose which parts of their religion to follow I don't see how they can not see how it's complete and utter horseshit while dismissing half of their chosen beliefs. 


That's funny.

It's not a circle jerk... It's true....

Fox News is not considered a reputable news source by anyone with a brain. They can't be trusted. 
because thats what i said....Are you fucking retarded? 

no I'm honestly asking, because only someone with a mental handicap would make that leap.

they lie, you can't deny it

It's pretty rich.  

It's not fuck you money. But it's certainly sufficient to live comfortably  
100k for one person. 

If its 100k combined for two people ten they only make 50k 

If however two people making 100k married then they'd be at 200+ 

Which is rich.
