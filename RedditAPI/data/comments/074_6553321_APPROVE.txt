It's how you teach children the concept of infinity. Think of a huge number, the biggest you can think of. Okay how about 1 followed by [a hundred zeroes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googol), well, infinity is even larger than that.

Edit: Sorry, I completely screwed up, by not reading your comment properly. Just ignore me.
No Infinity is one of the NaN values. Other values include things like 1/0, 0/0, infinity/infinaity, infinity - infinity. 
Obama is against the war in Iraq, and most Muslims hate Bush. Obama is a minority and a first gen American, both qualities that most Muslims in America can relate to. Obama is the son of a Muslim, has the middle name Hussain. You're going to have a hard time identifying the smears as a reason for Muslims supporting him.

Edit: That said, Palin's veiled racism did motivate me a bit more, but then I was going to vote for him anyway.
See another reason the Muslim can identify with him.
That was the thing the one that caught my eye. The other one was:

&gt; Obama's background, education, and outlook are Muslim, and fewer than 1% of Muslims convert to Christianity.

You don't think that might have to do with 90% of people of all religions don't care about religion enough to fully accept or disavow it. Out of the remaining 5% are stupid sheep, and out of the remaining 5% some will find happiness in their current religion while a few will find it elsewhere.
