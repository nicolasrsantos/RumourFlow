We'll, he's a Christian. I don't know which one is worse. I voted yes in the poll, it's closer to the truth, voting no could imply that he's atheist, which unfortunately he's not.
Prove true? Ya mean he really is a Muslim terrist? Who'd have thought?
How is calling Obama a muslim racist? Islam is a religion, not a race. Calling him black would not be racism either - just the plain truth.
I also fail to see the hypocrisy. I believe most of the people claiming that he's a muslim truly believe it. They are complete idiots, yes, but not hypocrites or liars.
Why the fuck should I care whether he's a muslim or a xtian? Either way it's fairy tales.
Which is why I say that every country has the leaders that it deserves.
Nice troll!
