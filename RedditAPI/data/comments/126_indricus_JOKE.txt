Here's the sad thing: the average person *is* dumb enough to believe that crap. And half of the population is *even dumber*.
I started with the realization that the average person is far less intelligent than my mental construct of 'a dumb person'. If my mental construct is actually *smarter than average*, then clearly the threshold for being dumb is actually much higher than a 100 IQ. So I extrapolated from there that my 'dumb person' mental construct probably represents someone with an IQ of 115, and that I thus regard an 'average person' as someone with an IQ of 130. Therefore, 98% of humanity is 'fucking stupid'.
A》"Okay, so we doubled our education budget, did student performance improve?"

B》"Nope, sorry, in fact performance is slightly worse this year."

A》"What? But we spent so much money! What happened?"

B》"Well, most of the money got spent on a new football field, some of the rest was spent on consultants to tell us how to improve student performance and new administrators to oversee changes and evaluate progress, and by the time we were done, there was no longer enough in the budget to still have a music department, so we let those teachers go."

A》"But how is a new football field supposed to improve academic performance?"

B》"Beats me!"
Just look at anti-vaxxers, GMO alarmists, etc. My own side of the aisle has almost as many idiots as the opposing side, and I'm stuck trying to get *more* idiots on my side, because 'people with at least half a brain' is too small a demographic to sway elections. 
Statistically it must be true. There's approximately equal numbers of left-leaning voters and right-leaning voters, hence competitive elections, and 98% of the populace is fucking stupid. Even if all of the 2% who are intelligent were left-leaning voters, which is not the case, both sides would still have nearly equal numbers of idiots.
