I hate these too - but I don't consider this a democratic party thing.
I honestly can't think of anything.  You have to admit there isn't much comparable to the doozies coming out of the hard right types. 
I've only really heard this claim from Republicans though (that democrats claim not voting for Obama means you are racist).  I do think there is a racial component for some - after seeing pictures like [this](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_v63oTveUEGI/Sq0Ip2ujMSI/AAAAAAAAJPI/I8aMlpSWaDU/s400/obama_lynched.jpg) and [this](http://www.allthingsdemocrat.com/pages/images/RacistObamaPic37.jpg) from the tea party types
Ja.  But the [republicans say this too.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaW92c2hqNs)
Whether or not it is right or wrong wasn't your question.
Why is this surprising?  Romney &amp; Ryan are caught lying every week.
