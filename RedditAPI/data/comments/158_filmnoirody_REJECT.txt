I agree, senility is not something I look for in a spiritual teacher.

I would question him for having racism if he actually thinks Obama is a "Muslim". But then again I am a dirty Liberal Jew who goes to Conservative services. You can only hide behavior and bigotry behind discourse so much. "Obama is a Muslim", your rabbi and members of the Klan are stuck with this bigoted statement and this is upsetting.
Obama's supposed 'Muslim' heritage is a diatribe of hate groups. 

"Obama is a Muslim" is a conspiracy theory supported by hate groups like wnd.
There is no Halachic reality that controls Islamic law. You can only dress up bigotry so far with discourse. I am not implying that the entire mass of orthodoxy is bigoted against the Reform movements. However I am holding to the logical conclusion that claiming the president to be Muslim holds true to racist hate speech paradigms parroted by the far right in this country. This opinion is the same racism that gives us the birth certificate controversy.
