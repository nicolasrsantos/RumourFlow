Sure go for it.  I am sure us Texans would be mighty fine...Even with our Illegal Immigrant Problem.  We have one of the most lucrative economies in the world.  

**TEXAS**
1.  It produces more cotton than any other state.

2.  Texas produces more beef cattle and sheep than any other state.

3.  And it produces more oil and natural gas than any other state, it contains a fourth of the known U.S. oil reserves.

4.  Texas has about 5 billion barrels of known petroleum deposits, and the stateâ€™s refineries can process about 4.6 million barrels of oil a day.

5.  Pipelines deliver Texas natural gas to states as far away as New York.  I am sure you northerners enjoy our Texas Natural Gas.  

This is why i hate when people on the internet bash Texas..It being fucking ethnocentric and writing off an entire state.  You know Austin is very similar to San Fran ( Apparently, Boston is the "San Fran of the East", but i have heard Austin called the same).   


**MORE FACTS FOR YANKEE**

In 2008, the state had a Gross Domestic Product of $1.245 trillion, second-largest in the U.S. and 15th-largest in the world.

Texas currently conducts more than $150 billion a year in trade with other nations; it leads all other states in exports, and has for five consecutive years. In 2005, per-capita domestic production in Texas was $42,975 per person.

Agree, not saying our state is perfect.  We have had a history of assclowns as governors as of late. But we could be a VERY profitable nation if we wanted to.   As far as education is concerned, our Universities are some of the tops in their fields ( UT law is a T-15 Law school, UT Biz School is top tier, as well as being a major research Facility).  You cant expect our education system to be tops given the influx of non English students in our state.  We don't have enough Spanish speaking educators.  And what do you mean by low wages? Arguing an increase in minimum wage is not a very strong argument.  
i am not complaining about it...i am just saying we were not prepared for it...we are getting there...and we are trying...unlike some states.
Finance=Paper.  Would mean absolutely nothing if Texas is a Sovereign Nation.  Also, I am sure our folks over in China-Asia, would Gladly buy our Oil and Fresh Beef.  
Finance=Paper.  Look at the recent financial crisis and the derivatives market.  And the US exports FRNs to the world and forces the world to buy oil in FRNs.  Both are equally as shady...but yeah keep on bashing Texas.  
I rather have my money in something tangible and live in an economy that produces real goods instead of trading papers.  Also, your forgetting that Austin is an up and coming financial powerhouse (especially with insurance agencies).   USAA is based in San Antonio.  
Houston Air Port...because you just proved how little you know about Chinese Culture.  Them and the Japanese hate frozen meat...its considered wrong.  Thus we fly pigs out of missouri to China.  I am sure we could fly pigs out of houston...and we could partner with mexico to use one of their ports or build a port while allowing them to use some oil and trade...see its called free trade.  Amazing huh?
But the main thing is they will still be making money tho...i am sure texas and mexico would have a FAR better relationship then texas and the usa...something like 50% of texans are hispanic or half hispanic...its quite amazing. IT would make an interesting fiction novel could we say at least?  
then let us annex.  or cut the programs...ur being very general about an entire area of the country... its ethnocentric and almost borderline racist and hateful...clearly u have never explored the south as i have.  I have seen far more racism here in Illinois then i ever have in texas.
I am from Texas...but please stop being a racist and hateful towards an entire part of the country... especially since you clearly have never lived there for a long part of time. 
TBH i don't currently live in Texas, I live in Illinois (Metro-East STL) where my state taxes keep going up.  I am tired of busting my ass for Chicago.  So your theory is flawed.  
Thank you...exactly what i tell people.  They think Texas is a bunch of gun toting rednecks and it is not.  Plus, there are rednecks everywhere...i live outside of STL and i can tell you the people that live here are **WORSE**  then in Texas.  Hell my parents (father is white, mother is mexican) dated, and got married right out of highschool in the 80s, and they were from a small farm cotton community in the panhandle of Texas.
