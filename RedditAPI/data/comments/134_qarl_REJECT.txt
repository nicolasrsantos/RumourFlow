no, see, since they bring-up Hitler first, they can't be the ones using nazi tactics.
they originally thought his birth certificate was illegitimate.  but once they realized it was fine, they needed to modify their belief so that they could continue to believe he's foreign.

which makes sense, because the birth certificate wasn't the true issue anyway, it was merely a rationalization for the fact he's black.

he's black and they're making-up reasons to hate him.  that's all there is.
i respect legitimate opposition to Obama's policies - i oppose many myself.

but the simple fact is that around half of republicans are birthers.  that means nearly half of them are RAVING LUNATICS.  they'll believe any half-assed thing you tell them, and disbelieve objective facts when they get in the way.

there's no painting needed here, they've done it all themselves.

and i'd also guess that you and your friends have no problem with evolution.

but a large number of republicans do - and your party panders to this group.  they have power to pick your candidates - they influence your policy - and they are terrifying.
look friend - the fact that so many of you are still harping on the (ridiculous) birther thing is proof that you don't really care about the facts.

you just don't.  Obama could be sending you gold and you'd still hate him for putting you in a higher tax bracket.  you're INSANE.
the thing is - you're treating the symptom, not the root illness.

the root illness is that these people are bigoted.  once it's proven to them that Obama isn't muslim, they'll simply jump to a new "reason" to not vote for him.
