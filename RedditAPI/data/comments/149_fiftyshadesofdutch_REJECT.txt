ELI5: Why people still maintain that Obama is a Muslim, terrorist, not born in America, etc.
That's something that has bothered me, too. I think it comes down to our roots in Christianity, and how the President has *always* been a Christian, of one faith or another.
That makes sense. 

Do you think this will be limited only to Obama/Democrats? Or are we going to start seeing this kind of thing for the next Republican elected to office?
That's what I was thinking too. I was just hoping there was *something* that it was based on, didn't want to lose any more of ^my ^^faith ^^^in ^^^^humanity.
Oh for sure. I have family members that are *diehard* Republicans, and I would honestly listen to them talk about their distaste for Obama if they had *facts,* but it always just devolves into the anti-Obama rhetoric.
