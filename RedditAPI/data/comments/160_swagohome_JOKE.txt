Be fair now - Reddit regularly gives front-page space to people who are probably too mentally unbalanced to work at Blockbuster.

People like this Ohio voter are a primary cause of the sad state our gov't is in.

Politicians basically *have* to resort to sound-bite politics and meaningless propaganda to win over voters like this - anyone engaging in real, nuanced political discussion will be ignored for the next candidate who spouts of some quick, easy-sounding answers.

Sadly, this is a large portion of actual voters.  If only we could establish an IQ requirement for voting...

I'm not sure that mocking ebonic-slang is racist.  Being black doesn't *cause* anyone to speak in that way - it's typically some combination of bad taste and ignorance.  
The vast majority of accusations of 'racism' do not have to do with racism at all.  Racism is bias against someone because of *race* - bias against someone because of they embrace a degenerate culture is *not* racism.
