Reminds me of a pickup truck I saw on the interstate on my way to work today. Guy had about twenty stickers on the back window and the ones that I saw were all far-right BS; Fight Back Vote Republican, the Gadsden flag, tea party, support for the Fox News blank slate that's now our district's Congressman... enough info to know that I never want to place myself within fifty feet of that jackoff without even including the sticker on the other side of the window, in big letters, GOD IS GREAT! ALLAH IS NOT! And that's the kind of person that grits his teeth, turns the corners of his mouth down unconsciously and narrows his eyes closer to a glare when he declares that President Obama is a *Muslim*. 
When people started voting based on which candidate they'd rather have a beer with. Because being totally comfortable tossing back a Bud Light longneck with the President at a Hooters in Fairfax is *way* more important than being some smarty pants elitist who actually wants to know facts and use logic and reason to come to a decision. C'mon, we all know the best decisions are made with a combination of initial gut instinct and what the evangelical Christian God probably wants. 
They're working on it. 
Think of how stupid the average person is, and then realize that half of them are stupider than that.

Right down to the Two Minutes Hate. Except instead of two minutes, it goes on 24/7 on TV, radio and the far right's little corner of the internet. 
After tornados hit in Alabama, I want to shoot myself. Churches get destroyed, faithful Christians' homes get blown to bits, faithful Christians get injured or killed... and on the news, it's all "god was looking out for us. god protected us. he reached down and held his hand over us. praise the lord I didn't die. I was never afraid of dying because god was with me. god doesn't give you anything more than you can handle." over, and over, and over. 
Don't forget that the guy a lot of these dolts are going to vote for, Gingrich, has claimed that secular atheists and radical Muslims are taking over America. Because secular atheists and radical Muslims working side-by-side wouldn't cause any problems. Nope. No problems at all. 
As the Alabama saying goes, thank god for Mississippi. 
It's amazing how much evangelical Christians know about Muslim traditions that even Muslims don't know about. 
That'll be his parting gift to 'Merrica. On the way out, SURPRISE, IRREVOCABLE SHARIA! 
&gt; the President parades this asshole in front of the cameras looking like a fucking Taliban Mullah

&gt; THE PRESIDENT, in the context of the Afghan war, holds a special Rose Garden ceremony at which a TALIBAN SYMPATHIZER WITH A FUCKING TALIBAN LOOKING BEARD GROWN TO LOOK LIKE A TALIBAN BEARD

Apparently, shaggy-haired old crunchy hippie-looking dudes are literally Taliban mullahs. Although I bet some in that sub hate Taliban mullahs and hippies roughly the same amount.
