Wake up!  Barack knew he wanted to be president when he was 10!! This is all part of his master plan to make sure that a Muslim is elected to office!

I've gotten this response too (though not on the Obama issue) and I point out that snopes always links to sources where they found the information so if you still question their take on it, you can do your own research.  Seems to help.
I can think people need to be educated and frustrated when they aren't in my house and then go out and help people be educated in public in a perfectly non-judgemental way.  It's amazing that way.
If you're going to take advantage of your priviledge to vote, you should take the time to do at least a bit of research yourself or ask for some help with it.  My dad will most likely be voting for the first time in the election this year (largely due to Obama) and if he asked me to find out McCain's views on education I would certainly do my best to give him the most non-biased information I can.  I understand that he's not as net-saavy as me, but he also understands that and knows when to ask for help.
So the small population of athiests are the only people suitable for president?
