Thanks for your interpretation of what she meant and what McCain "saw". I think she may have just been questioning Obama's natural born citizen requirement to be POTUS and I think McCain just saw another opportunity to shore up his RINO status.
When someone says "I think she may have..." it's usually indicative of an opinion, or interpretation if you prefer. Despite the downvoting that was anticipated for having the audacity to call BS on the interchangeability of "he's a Muslim" and "he's a dirty, evil foreigner who wants to destroy our country and sell our daughters into slavery" I still like my "interpretation" better. The point is I cannot and do not know why she phrased her comment as she did and neither does that diamond character.
To quote HRC, "at this point, what difference does it make?" Liberals just love double standards I guess...
It's the very definition of US politics
You seem to forget (or ignore) that every time Obama speaks he rattles roughly have the population. His calls for calm in Ferguson and Baltimore were not very effective were they?
