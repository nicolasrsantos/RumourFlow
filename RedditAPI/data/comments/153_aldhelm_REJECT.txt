It's not just a muslim tradition. It's an Arab thing too. Christian and Secular Arabs will say God Willing. Hell I have even heard and Israeli guy say it once and when I asked him about it he told me that it's an Arab thing that rubbed off on jews in the North.
Wrong. Well some may say it but they are wrong. 

Your only a muslim when you **believe** in Islam. It doesn't matter if you were raised with muslims. If you don't have the belief in your hearts and don't practice it then your not a Muslim.

Islam is very different from Christianity. We don't have lapsed Muslims like the Catholics do. Your either a practicing believing Muslim or your not a Muslim.

Calling your self a Muslim and appear to be one for the sake of others when your really aren't is a grave sin. Worse then being an Atheist.
&gt; My point was that if Obama was, as a child, instructed in the Koran and had a Muslim father, then decided he'd prefer to be a Christian, then he could be considered an apostate.

Unless Obama himself choose to be a muslim and live an Islamic lifestyle when he was old enough to realize whats going on then he wasn't one. If he was simply raised has a muslim and lived with Muslims before leaving that environment then he wasn't one. Becides I don't think he was raised in a muslim lifestyle. Obama has himself stated that his religous environment was non-existant and from what I've read about his father he wasn't exactly a real Muslim. His family back in Kenya doesn't inspire much. Most likely they were just like a lot of African Christian and Muslims Abrahamic in name only. Tribal and animist beliefs supersede Christianity and Islam for many many Africans. Especially Kenyans,even in the cities.

&gt; What's the situation with all young children in Islam, then? The mentally deficient? The dead?

I personally don't know what Kind of children you have seen in your lifetime. Are American children able to make informed decisions with full understanding of the ramifications? Something that your counterparts around the world lack?

In Islam you have to understand what it means to be a muslim before you become one. A 6 year isn't exactly going to tell the difference between Jesus and Isa unless his parents drill it into his head and he regurgitates it out.
Same reason why adults who are forced to convert to Islam aren't truly Muslims. They never made any informed decisions for themselves with full understanding.
&gt; Ok, so no children of Muslims are Muslims until they're old enough. What happens if they die young? Do they get to go to heaven?

Besides, I was under the impression that in Islam religious affiliation passes from father to son. Could be wrong about that.

Kids who die before they are mature go automatically to heaven. Any crap they pull has young kids they won't be held responsible for because they are to young. There is a debate wether Jewish/Christian kids go straight to heaven to but for me it makes sense that they would go straight up.

Oh and there is no Father ---&gt; Son Transition that I can think of in Islam. Are you confusing it with Judaism?

&gt; He attended classes in Koranic studies in Indonesia. But then, I attended French classes andI didn't end up French. Point is, though, that at some point in his life he was treated as though he was a Muslim. Possibly enough to make some idiots claim apostasy.

I've read that school was Muslim for Muslim kids only. The other kids who attended weren't brought up Islamically.

&gt; No. Then again, there's no call for the death of apostates.

Where is the call for death? From the a person or from the source of everything that is holy to Muslims the koran? Because I know that in the Koran it says "There is no compulsion in Religon". Richard Dawkins flicked through and showed it on one of his Relgion is evil! programs.
I just wish people would stop using those Christian ideas for Islam. It's almost always in a bad light.

Some guy who goes around raping and is a non-practising muslim (aka non muslim). "OMG MUSLIM RAPE WHITE WOMEN IN EUROPE!!!!!"

Some Italian guy who never ever believed in Islam and only pretended to do so because of his mother (which would make him a munafiqeen - Hypocrite. One of the worst punishments waits for him) and when she dies he stops pretending and converts to Catholicism.

"OMG MUSLIM CONVERTED TO CHRISTIANITY. ISLAM SUCKS!"
