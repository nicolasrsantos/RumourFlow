Barack Obama: non-Muslim. Can anybody point me 
to any simple evidence on this? [self]
Thanks.

I was hoping to get some amplification on this from the folks here. 

I.e., the idea of a Muslim attending Christian services is really pretty crazy.
Well, again - in this post I'm trying to focus only on evidences that I can use to show people that he's *not* a Muslim.
Thanks.

Those last two would be considered quite important, right?


That is of no interest to me right now.

1) I don't have any problem with the idea of him being Muslim myself. (I don't think that he is, but I wouldn't have any problem with that.)

2) AFAIK he is not a Muslim, so why say that he is?

3) I'm not interested right now in what problems *they* might have with him being Muslim - I'd like to try to make clear to them that all the evidence is that he is *not* Muslim.


But is there anything about his known public behavior that would absolutely contradict the idea that he is Muslim?
Thanks.

I was thinking of something like this.

(AFAIK, he's not Catholic. He was a member of the [United Church of Christ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Church_of_Christ) for many years, resigned his membership in 2008 after the pastor made some controversial remarks, and is currently considered to be an "unaffiliated Christian".)
&gt;if you're hoping that things we write here will convince people he's not Muslim, good luck.

:-)  I don't expect to succeed but I'd like to do what I can.
