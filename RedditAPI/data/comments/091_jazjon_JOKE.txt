Obama is a Muslim? (Old high school friend's mother's response to my facebook Obama celebration post &amp; more)
I wasn't sure how else to reply to her by the way.  I think she is beyond reality at this point in her life. 
I was that excited Obama won.   I can't remember the last self post I liked, so no need for alarm.  ;-)
I guess it's not too late to reply with some of this but I doubt it will get through to her.  I was not sober at the time of my reply. 
Unfortunately yes (small towns yes, large cities are better)
No reply yet, my friends slammed her a bit recently.   I did post the reddit link though lol
I got really excited when my iPhone news push notification said Obama won the election.  I made the post and went tap happy liking my own post along with dozens of other friends posts.   I can assure you, liking my own status is not the norm for me.  I know it hits a nerve since I read the same complaint multiple times on here (whoops)
As a gay man I thought it would be good to expose her to what life if like for me in California now that I'm no longer in the middle of no-where. (Small town in North East Illinois near Wisconsin)  I assumed she was a democrats actually before her post. (Her sons are!)

True but I kept my response simple and over looked it as part of me holding back. (A LOT)
Apparently!

As a gay man I wanted to expose her to life outside of her midwest small town life. (I'm now in California) I thought she was a democrats before her post. (Her sons are)
Thanks I held back and kept it simple

I held back, over looked the easy targets, and kept my response simple.  That's more powerful than slamming back at every angle. Her poor grammar speaks for itself.

I wanted to expose her to a gay mans life in California.  (She's in a small Midwest town). I also thought she was a democrat. (Her sons are)
No response yet, my friends made a few slams though.
