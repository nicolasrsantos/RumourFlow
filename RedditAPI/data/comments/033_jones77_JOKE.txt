Dunno what's worse: The actual "smear" or the fact that it's implicit that being Muslim is a bad thing.
Rove's a fucking genius (and monster).  Or at least he looks like a genius in front of a spineless and pointless US press.
Yup, the US really flies the flag for human rights.  A beacon to the rest of the world.  :-p

You shouldn't infer that someone is a "bad" person simply because they're Muslim.  That's just pure bigotry.

People should be judged on how they act and what they believe.  Not on what you assume they believe.

I will grant you some despicable acts/opinions come out of countries where Islam predominates **but** I'd argue those were more cultural, rather than intrinsically part of a modern Islamic belief system.  And I don't think Islam is automatically any worse than some of craziness that comes out of the Christian world (holes in condoms anybody?) ... so why use it to infer something negative?  You don't see people bitching 'cos JFK was Catholic ...
Yes.

But, I just don't think that someone's self-identification implies as much as you are saying it does.

And, I don't think it's fair to pre-emptively dismiss someone because they're Muslim.  Especially 'cos most people's domain knowledge of Islam tends to be misguidedly homogenous and filtered through a pointless media.
This is one of those articles I don't mind voting up over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over again.
