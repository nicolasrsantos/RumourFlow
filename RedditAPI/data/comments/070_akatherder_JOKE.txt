That's a tough rumor to fight because Obama has to say "No, I'm not an Arab/Muslim... not that there's anything wrong with that!"

It's almost like denying it puts you in a position of being against it.
I think it's completely different when someone, who is fairly anonymous, "accuses" you of being Baptist.  You can let everyone believe you are Baptist or publicly announce that you are not.  When you announce it publicly, there's a fine line between "I don't want to be associated with that group!" and "No I'm not associated with that group, but they're totally cool so I wouldn't mind if I was one of them, ya know what I mean? Some of my best friends are Baptist."
That sounds like "This source of yours is a damned liar and you're a fool for believing him.  Go do your research; I am NOT a Muslim."
I think that's the conventional wisdom, but Obama has been pointing out rumors and lies and it seems to be working well.

He's a smart strategist.  No democrat is going to carry those states in the general election.  He can spend time in other states that are more meaningful during the primary.
This is a non-issue.  Anyone who is stupid enough to not vote for Obama because he is Muslim is stupid enough to still not vote for him because he is black.  

Let's be honest here folks. the people we're talking about... their votes were earmarked for McCain since their grandpappy fought for the Confederacy.
