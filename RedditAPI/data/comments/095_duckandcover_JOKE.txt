Well, it is if nothing else a statement of gullibility of epic proportions.
When I see all the posts about how unfair it's been for Ron Paul, I think about Obama being called a Kenyan Muslim Commie Terrorist, who's going to Kill your grandma with healthcare, for 4 years.
Our political system is corrupted by money but the media is just shitty just biasing their coverage to a preconceived expected outcome (e.g. CNN doesn't hate Ron Paul per se)

 I will make an exception for Fox.  As you may have noticed   Fox employed every person they though was a potential candidate.  Point being that Fox seems to be acting as a GOP kingmaker and they seem to not like Libertarians.  
That doesn't mean that each and everything they report is scrutinized for content.  The media has always had advertisers.  When I grew up TV had CBS, NBC, and ABC and that was it and yet they managed to have 60 minutes that ripped companies a new one and reported "bad stuff".

I'm not saying that there's isn't some pressure from advertisers but there are a lot of advertisers.  Take FOX news for instance.  It's GOP TV.  It was founded by Roger Ailes a long time operative to be GOP TV.  The advertisers know it's GOP and they cater to that or they don't advertise on it and yet plenty of advertisers do.
I'm not sure accelerate but the point is taken and I agree.  I could throw rocks and Ron Paul but that was never the point.  The point I was making was the politicians get a lot of unfair press from people with agendas.  It's awful but I guess that's the way things are.  
pretty much

I'm still appalled at not just how much disinformation there is but how much of it is believed; how gullible we Americans seem to be.
The political pundits don't believe that Ron Paul is electable.  Their coverage reflects that and so it becomes a self-fulfilling  prophesy.

On the other hand, with Obama you have Fox news and the right wing echo chamber spreading disinformation, e.g.furthering the birthers, deathers, etc.   They also hate Ron Paul.

Either way, the media sucks and if you're on the wrong side of it boy does it suck
Oh for fucks sake.   I would call what you wrote a cheap shot if I thought you knew any better.  As this [graph](http://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/images/item/cbpp-20110413-downturndeficit.png) so concisely shows, the deficits are largely due to Bush's polices which include two wars, the tax cuts (most going to the wealthy that the GOP house refused to stop), and the economic downturn itself.
