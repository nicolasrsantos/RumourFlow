hell no, he goes to church, he is a christian (maybe a nominal one) but a christian none the less, only people who are slightly off in the head or absolutely the worst people think he is actually a muslim 
I know that feel amigo, although being the black sheep lefty scum that I am, they have mostly blocked me at this point 
im pro life, but I still understand and respect the other side 
they don't though, that is not what abortion is 
I disagree with abortion, but I see nothing wrong with his rationale as it describes his opinion 
yes, and that is what anti-abortion is, I am pro-life, I care about what happens after that child is born, because usaully there is a reason that the woman goes into get an abortion, poverty, pressure, shame all these things play into such a decision. I believe that if you are going to make that woman have that child you should make adoption easier and direct more couples to it, anti-poverty initiatives to give kids like that a better chance, increase education spending for inner-city and rual schools in order to give those children youve saved a better chance a success, put a stop to wars so that the preditation of the working class by military recruiters wont get them killed. oromote job programs and wage raises in order to help break the poverty cycle so that way when presented with the choice, potential mothers will chose life because they are able to take care of the child or give it up for adoption. This is what it means to be pro life and not just anti-abortion  
now we are just going to get into this big large argument where at some point you will call me a libtard or evil or any one of a number of nasty things because you cannot conceive of anybody interpreting the bible different from you and still being a christian. and i dont really want that, so lets just agree to disagree and we don't have to go through this whole lefty v righty bullshit  
why? what proof do you have? 
oh, fair enough
