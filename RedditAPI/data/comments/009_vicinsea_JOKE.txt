Because he isn't. Why do people think he is????? Because those people are dumb and and they VOTE.
In Florida....25% of voters couldn't push the chads all the way thru......and Bush got the vote there. This system is messed up!!!
Sorry to correct you but (by definition) 50% of all people are morons...and yet they find time to VOTE!
Unfortunately, the half that vote are also mostly the folks that think the world was actually created in 6 days.
Muslims in droves???? all 1% of them?????
