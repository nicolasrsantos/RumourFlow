The WTO protesters.  Don't get me wrong the third world gets fucked over in international trade, but that's because the developed world can use it's political clout to get away with subsidies and deficits the third world can only dream of.

Honestly, who do you think is most likely to end the drone strikes, shut down Gitmo, or whatever.

Romney: Not on your life 0% chance

Jill Stein/Gary Johnson: Good chance if elected, but they won't be elected so it's a moot point.

I'm hoping for a repeat of 2008 with a better economy this time so they can actually get to some of the social issues.  I firmly believe that Obama is further left-wing than he has been able to act given the nonsense people have been throwing against him.  

So who should we vote for? Or should we just blame the two-party system and pretend like that will ever get anything done while blaming both sides for policies we gave no input on?
