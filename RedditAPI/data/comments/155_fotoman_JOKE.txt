You're trying to explain this to Christians who also eat pork, shrimp, plant two crops in the same field, divorce, commit adultery, work on the sabbath, perpetuate greed, don't help the poor, and get tatoos...good luck
The truth is out there...
Thank Odin that's only 11% of the US population...
There's always a different side to every statement huh?  :D
That really only equates to 20% of Americans.  I mean 20% of Americans are pretty nuts, so that's sort of par for the course.

I'm pretty sure that group of people is also included in many of these other groups as well:

33% of Americans don't believe in evolution.   
20% of the population cannot locate America on a map.   
20% of Americans still believe that the sun revolves around the earth.  
21% of Americans believe in witches.  
22% of Americans believe world will end in their lifetime.  
25% Americans view marijuana as more dangerous than alcohol.  
25% of Americans believe we won our independence from a country OTHER than Great Britain (many said France (who actually helped us defeat the British), and others said China...)  
20% of the population cannot locate America on a map.   
20% of Americans believe that UFOs have abducted someone they know.  
30% of Americans still believe that Saddam Hussein was directly behind the September 11 attacks.  
20% of Americans have doubts that we actually went to the moon.  
37% of Americans believe global warming is a hoax.  
20% of Americans still had a favorable view of George W Bush during the last few months he was in office.  
20% of Americans believe that winning the lottery is probably the most practical and easiest way to make a few thousand bucks.  
50% of Americans believe that Judaism did not come before Christianity.  
29% of Americas could not identify the Pacific Ocean on a world map.  
14% of Americans believe that dinosaurs and humans once roamed the earth together. And another 27% believe that it probably happened...(that's a scary 40%!)  
which is ironic because  the only way to get into office in Texas 20 years ago was to win the Dem primary.  Many people would NEVER vote for the Repubs.

BTW, it saddens me what has happened to the state I grew up in :|  No longer live there (moved 12 years ago).
