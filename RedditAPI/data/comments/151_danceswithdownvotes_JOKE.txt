I'm currently living with my parents in Alabama and the racism is just random...and comes out for no reason. 

For example, I mentioned having someone over for company and my mom said the house looks like a nigger house. Just fucking out of nowhere. Not messy, not untidy, no, had to make a fucking racist reference.

  My best friend growing up is mixed black/white and doesn't really go for black chicks. Guy is one of the most fantastic people you'll ever meet but due to where we live he had trouble finding women whose parents wouldn't threaten murder for their white daughter dating a black man. Shit of it is, I'm sure he got plenty of flak from the other side for being so light skinned.  He even has green eyes  I grew up with him, my parents know him and how great he is. He's currently engaged to a white girl, one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen in my life. My mom disagrees due to the race issue. I told her honestly she should be fucking ashamed of herself for wanting to deny someone so great happiness just because of his skin color.  I've told her many times that I love her, but that I won't shed a tear when her generation and their mindset is laying in the fucking ground rotting.  I just...don't understand the hatred. I can't understand. It must run deep, deeper than I'll ever know, for her to feel that way toward someone I'd be happy to have a daughter of mine marry. 

I'm a 26 year old white male in Alabama...I don't understand the racism...but it runs deep and is going nowhere. Not sure how I won my freedom from the trap but I wish I could help others do the same.  There are ignorant racists here, raising ignorant bigot kids of
their own...and it breaks my heart. 
The problem here in the South is when you mix education and differing morality...ie things like interracial marriages, gay marriage, creationism, etc.  It's a shame...but people here get real uppity when you start messing with "the way things ought to be.". It's what makes religion so dangerous...people are raised to believe blindly, and it just snowballs. 
Man, you have no idea. Well actually now I guess you do. 
Happens more than you'd think here, and among people you would otherwise have respected. 

Got a friend who saw no end to the racist rim/bass music jokes when Obama got elected. Niggers this, welfare that. People just get stupid here when race comes up...as I've said elsewhere, it runs deep...so deep, and there's so much ignorance and hatred toward black people here. And it comes from sources that I'd expect better from...people that I call friends, and with whom I no longer discuss politics and religion. 
Im so hungry...
They just exist so separately I think. I mean, we mingle and interact when needed but in the end...to each their own.  It really is a shame...so much potential wasted in fear and ignorance. 
Alabamian here. It's such a shame isn't it?  Southern culture has such potential, but racism is beaten in so deep I'm afraid it'll be a long time before we're free of it. Everything you said is absolutely correct. And I hope others that read your comment will pick up on that you weren't trying to connect politeness and racism.
