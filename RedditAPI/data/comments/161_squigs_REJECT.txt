well, I'm not a Republican or a Democorat, but there are two things that do bug me

1. When their sole objection to Romney is him being a Mormon
2. Dismissing Republicans as idiots.
&gt; Dismissing Republicans as idiots... that one, I'm not so sure about.

Maybe if I'm more specific.

There are many people who vote Republican for reasons that are perfectly consistent with their ideology, and people who vote Democrat for spurious reasons. We may disagree with the ideology, since it tends to be about helping the rich get richer, or increasing benefits for religions, but if you're rich or religious, it makes perfect sense to vote Republican.
If you think the Mormon undergarments are seriously considered as "magic underwear" then you're apparently arguing for the "Republicans are idiots"stance.

The temple garments are typically seen as symbolic. A reminder of the promises they made to live a good life. Perhaps, rather than make judgements and invent what he might say it would make sense to understand the basic tenets of the religion you're mocking.

&gt;  I mean shit, this is a religion that only started letting black people in during the 1980s. I thought this was 'Murica, not apartheid South Africa.

What was Mitt Romney's stance on that, and does he think this was a bad decision from the church? 

His official position seems to be that [he strongly approved of the change](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/29/mitt-romney-mormon-faith_n_1834466.html) *"during his 2008 presidential run, Romney said he was "anxious to see a change in my church" and cried with joy when the church lifted the ban on black priests in 1978."*

As for the health care reform thing, he believes this should be a state thing.  The [official stated position is](http://www.mittromney.com/issues/health-care) *"In place of Obamacare, Mitt will pursue policies that give each state the power to craft a health care reform plan that is best for its own citizens"*
Your friends may well believe that. Seems a little unfair to extrapolate this to all Mormons.

But even if you do, every president has believed something completely ridiculous. Many believed they could telepathically communicate with the creator of the universe. Some believed that certain magic rituals kept evil spirits away. A lot believe that God is Jesus, God is the holy father and Jesus isn't the holy father. that simply defies logic.
"...I have a great deal of sympathy for anybody who gets, you know, smeared..."

No reading between the lines suggests that she thinks this is anything other than a smear, and she's quite clear about that.  

Is this the reason people aren't voting for Hilary?  Because when she's given the opportunity to defend her political opponent, she doesn't do so in exactly the right way?
I think it's a shame that it matters to people whether Barrack Obama is a Muslim.
