"A logical response to Conservapedia would sound something like this: 'All hail the hypno-toad. Al Gore will lead the liberal nation to glorious empire upon the moon.'"

Well said.
According to librapedia, Conservapedia says: 

  1.  All kangaroos are descended from a single pair who were on Noah's Ark.
   2. Gravity is an unproven theory.
   3. Einstein's General Relativity "has nothing to do with physics".
   4. Only followers of Christianity are capable of religious faith.
   5. Atheists are incapable of being moral.
   6. Jews are "touchy" about the Holocaust.
   7. Some of the most violent homicides seen by pathologists are among male homosexuals.
   8. The Beach Boys are an example of heavy metal.
   9. There were dinosaurs on Noah's Ark.
  10. The Earth might be the center of the universe
  11. Rock music causes riots.[1]
  12. McCarthyism was good.
  13. Ann Coulter is just kidding.
  14. Belief in the Theory of Relativity leads to a belief in moral relativity (a bad thing).
  15. Dinosaurs are "generally believed" to be extinct.
  16. "God exercises eternal and righteous judgment of the wicked in hell."
  17. Homosexuality can cause bad smoking habits. 
Yes, I just copied and pasted and the underpants gnomes that live inside Reddit added the numbers.

BTW, the Bible says that Noah brought *7* of each kind of "clean" animal and 2 of each "unclean" animal. A way big-ass ark.

Well, I'm unclean, so I'm going to take a shower.
How did you know that I have a split personality?

You paranoids are out to get us all!
True: during the Reagan years, his Secretary of the Interior was a clown named James Watt. He's famous for saying that there's no point in protecting the environment because the rapture is coming soon, so who cares. 

The Beach Boys are Republicans, so Reagan invited them to the White House to play. Watt said to the press, "That kind always attracts the wrong element."

He probably thought that Karen Carpenter was the whore of Babylon.
I'm the center of the Universe!  Woohoo!
No, I think he's right. You may be envisioning them as liars. I see them as bullshitters.

Bullshitters pay no attention to whether something is true or false, only whether they can exploit it.So it's unclear if they know or not.
