I'm pretty sure Richard Dawkins has argued pretty extensively that religion is contagious actually.

And he did practice Islam right? That's kind of an important part of receiving a religious education, same as attending a Catholic school etc.
I'm not a birther or trying to discredit Obama in any way, but isn't he at the very least an ex-Muslim?

This could have been some right wing propaganda or something, but I could've sworn I've read that he spent his grade school years attending a Muslim school, prayed 5 times a day, the whole bit, then converted to Christianity sometime after he came to live in the States.

EDIT: What's with the downvotes?  I'm genuinely curious
Again, I'm not saying that this makes him some kind of horrible person, I was just asking if he, in fact, WAS a Muslim at some point in his life.
Well now we're just talking in circles.  I guess now we've established that he did go to a Muslim school for awhile when he was a kid, which answers my question.
Did I hit a serious nerve here unintentionally or something? I'm honestly. truly. not. trying. to. attack. Obama.
