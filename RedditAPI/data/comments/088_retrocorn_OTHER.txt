Mittens is a pretty awesome version though.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that all religious people are stupid, but many discard scientific reason for what is essentially a belief in magic. Gullible would be a better word I think. Or indoctrinated.
I mean as far as the religion itself goes, not medicine and the like. Jesus rising from the dead, turning water into wine, walking on water, that sort of thing. Miracles basically. That and prayer. Telepathy could exist I suppose, but I don't think we have any evidence of it.

Also I should note my original comment said many, not all. Although I do live pretty much right in the middle of the bible belt so my experience with Christians from other regions is quite limited.
Guns being illegal hurts criminals about as much as DRM hurts pirates. The criminals aren't the ones which are affected by it. Law abiding citizens are.
Except that somehow, someway, there will always be guns and ammunition. If not for civilian use then for military purposes. And that's just taking the US into account. The weapons could come from other countries which still produce them. Not to mention the fact that it is possible to construct makeshift firearms.

And even if it were possible to ensure that guns couldn't be obtained at all, criminals would still find a way to kill.
No, but I imagine that some could give you cancer.
