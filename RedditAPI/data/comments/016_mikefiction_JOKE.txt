Is calling Obama a Muslim actually slander? That suggests that to be a Muslim is a bad thing.

It's false, not slander. Plus it's written, which means libel would be the correct word; slander is spoken.
Believe me I read it - some nasty stuff - I'm just referring to the title of the post. It's not slander, it's libel if written. And I didn't see anything libelous, just childish and racist.
Is Barak Obama bringing up a lawsuit for libel? 
No?

Edit: And just because 'to them' it's a bad thing doesn't make it libel. I think eating french fries is a bad thing. If I were to write that you eat french fries, would that be libel?
Slander and libel are legal terms, with legal definitions.

And don't excuse poor use of language, it hurts us in the long run.

Edit: Also, saying something untrue, that at face value is not defamatory, but relying on people to imagine a deeper meaning is not slander or libel. If you were to specifically print that Barak Obama is a radical Muslim that has affiliations with Osama Bin Laden, etc, that could be libel. But only if Barak Obama were to bring up a civil case himself. Otherwise, it's still just an untruth.

Here's a more accurate title:

Hypocrisy in Christianity at its finest: An Obama bash thread in a Christian forum filled with racist comments and "Obama is a Muslim" lies.
Actually... slander is spoken, libel is written.

Racism is neither slander nor libel, it's racism. Saying someone is Muslim is borderline, and in most cases would be considered neither libelous nor slanderous and might even be considered a legal attack on the Muslim faith if it were ruled as defamation. 

Does Barak Obama find it a defamation of his character to be called a Muslim? I doubt it. Otherwise, it's just a lie.
"is definitely "untruthful oral (spoken) statement""

Really? you hear the words that are *written* and *published* on that forum spoken aloud? I want some of those drugs...
A better title would be: Filled with racist *and* "Obama is a Muslim" talk
