Because Muslims donâ€™t value the same things we do and a Muslim would be a horrible president of the United States.  Unless you want a president who believes in honor killings or covering up women I guess.  
But he does personally support those rules.  Just because he's smart enough to not propose them doesn't mean anything.  There are no countries run by Muslims that don't have abhorrent and backwards laws (by our standards), and that's why a politician being called a Muslim is an insult in the US.
I literally don't know a single Christian that supports honor killings, suicide bombings, covering up women with burlap sacks, or female genital mutilation.  Seriously, I don't know of one. So no, my logic does not make Christians support the same thing.  I know you desperately want to believe that Christians are just as bad as Muslims, but it's just not true.  Christians the world over have built prosperous, stable, progressive societies.  Ones that you enjoy living in.  Muslims don't do that.  That's why it's an insult to be called a Muslim as a politician. 
Then you don't know any or they are lying to you.

You can read through this http://www.pewresearch.org/files/old-assets/pdf/muslim-americans.pdf and see why being called a Muslim is an insult to politicians.  Support for suicide bombing among young Muslim Americans is particularly disturbing.  Remember a suicide bombing is the deliberate murder of innocent civilians, not collateral damage, primary target.  Completely disgusting.  This is in the US, globally the picture is much much worse.

Circumcision is nothing like FGM and it's fucking absurd to compare the two.
