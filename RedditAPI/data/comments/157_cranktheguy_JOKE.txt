Houston is pretty conservative city. My relatives in Houston are among that 23%.
I like to look at the positive side: 77% are not stupid. 
Out of Texas.

That makes this Aggie sad.
It makes more sense once you understand that the Ag and Business are for those too stupid for the Engineering majors. 
I don't think Karl Rove had anything to do with this. 

"Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity."
I think the civil war answered that question. 
I don't get this whole red state vs. blue state thing a lot of people seem to have going on. There are both liberal and conservative people in all states, and blue states have their share of retarded people as well. To seriously solve the problems this country is facing will require people working together, and your attitude makes this seems like it is a lost cause. The next time you see Bush pushing his side of the issue, realize that YOU are just as stupid and guilty for divisive behavior.

That being said, I am a liberal living in Texas. So yes, I would want to stop Texas from separating off. And according to another divisive reddit article (that I will not waste my time finding), Texas pays more in taxes that it receives, and is thus a net benefit for the country. We also have a rich tech industry, a huge share of the refineries, a number of natural resources, an abundance of farm and ranch land, beautiful national parks, etc. It would be a loss for both sides.

Hopefully you will reconsider your childish opinion.
