Your numbering confuses me. Are the beach boys a heavy metal band as a consequence of the single pair of kangaroos on Noah's Ark?

Also dinosaurs are "generally believed" to be extinct aren't they? Though I'd heard crocodiles were dinosaurs, or were they just around at the same time?

That's shocking. So not only are dinosaurs still alive - they're in my garden eating my worms!
Though that would explain the cult of the lizard king.
That'll be just the 2 of you in the shower then I hope.
