&gt;False. Islamic writings and teachings, up until the late 70s when American influence in the Middle East allowed the Muslim equivalent of the Westboro Baptist Church to gain power, are just as peaceful IF NOT MORE PEACEFUL than Christian writings.

Correct. Even in Muslim Spain, the Moors allowed Christians and Jews to use their Mosques for worship during their respective Sabbaths.
&gt;Islam is markedly more brutal and markedly more militaristic and political than Christianity is, when it comes to central doctrinal writings and how they are usually interpreted.

Are you fucking kidding me? Mohammed allowed people to be absorbed into the tribe. Yahweh regularly said to go into the village and murder every man, woman, and child. As a non-believer its like trying to argue whether Larry the Cable Guy is more retarded than Gallagher.
&gt;they won't send letters to this idiot, they won't speak up and condemn this hatred and intolerance. These are not good behaviors.

So, you hate all Christians because they aren't flooding the Lord's Resistance Army with letters and denouncing them at every turn, correct?
I think you are confusing religious issues with socio-economic ones. Afghanistan is not so much ruined by fundamentalist Islam as people there trend towards fundamentalism because their economy, education, and technology is straight out of the middle ages...in Western terms. Try comparing a Christian that grew up in Manhattan with one that grew up in rural Mississippi.
Yeah, but Jainism is a mitigating factor that completely opposes violence. Christianity and Islam both have a basis in a god that loves blood. For every 9/11 you pull out, there is a crusade or an Iraq. We saw whole rural communities working to protect Eric Rudolph who blew up abortion clinics and a gay nightclub. 
As a former southerner and as someone who has to live in this country, I am concerned anytime people with the power to vote don't know what a fact is.
