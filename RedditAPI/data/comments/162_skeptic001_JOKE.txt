&gt;But we don't hate all Christians just because of the crusades.

but we would if they tried to pull that shit again today
First...Bush was an idiot and said a lot of stupid things...and fortunately, soldiers did not march into Iraq under a Christian banner with a mission to convert or destroy
uh.. as bad is it is, I don't think that compares to the millions killed during the crusades....
My point is that the crusades were a thousand years ago, ancient history...9/11 is modern history and still very relevent.....If Christians started that shit again, they would be among the must hated around....but fortunately Christians lost the balls to follow their own dogma centuries ago.. Christians are not strapping on bombs and killing the innocent in the name of their god, or flying planes into  buildings.  
..next, Scientist ask why anyone believes anything said by Fox News
