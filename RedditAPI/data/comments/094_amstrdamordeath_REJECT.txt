For all of those who complain, this is why the electoral college exists still.
I don't disagree, but at least the stupid people with more power are informed.
Look I didn't support Obama, but I think he is the lesser of all evil douches, but he is not some super messiah come to rescue America.  The bottom line is, the "NO TRUTH WHATSOEVER" is reddit talk for, "I KNOW EVERYTHING", when in fact, you know nothing except what they allow you to hear.  For all you know, unless you are in fact Obama and know everything about him, he very well could be muslim and he very may well not know the national anthem.  I doubt it is true, but the fact that you don't believe it at all, means you are no less a problem then this guy in the article.  The one thing I can't stand anymore about reddit is the fact that everyone "KNOWS FOR SURE", but the truth is, we don't know jack shit.  You may THINK it is true, and you may believe it, but the truth is, you are only hoping and assuming, it does not make it truth.
I am not even just talking about Obama and his muslim or christian fan club.  My point was that when someone says "I KNOW FOR SURE" or "THAT IS NOT TRUE", unless it is about themselves, or they can read someones fucking mind, they are ASSUMING and taking an EDUCATED GUESS.   
Wow.. that is some definitism.  Your mother in law... thats great.  Now I have to believe it.  I don't take "gimmees" on anything.  That is how we ended up in the situation we are in now.  We gimmeed ourselves right into 8 years of Bush.
Wow.  I don't like Hillary.  At all.  But reading some of the comments here, you would think she dawned an evil grin and cackled about it.  I would never have thought that she was being shrewd about it, at least until I read the responses here.
