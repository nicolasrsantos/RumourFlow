Actually, the reverse is true. Being a Mormon myself, we use the King James Bible as a supplemental text to the Book of Mormon, which is the primary text of our beliefs. 
To be honest with you, I'm not quite sure. Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism, grew up during the 2nd Great Awakening in the 'burned over district' of New York. He was surrounded by evangelical religions that used the KJV, so my guess is that the KGV is the only version of the Bible that was available to Joseph Smith and other early restored Church members. But that's just my guess, I don't really know.
I would also like to point out that, despite being founded during the 2nd Great Awakening, Mormonism is not a Protestant/Evangelical religion.
There are a few things I would like to clear up in this thread.

Firstly, I'm just going to put it out there that I am a Mormon. I'm not here to preach or proselyte, I'm here to debunk some of the misconceptions about Mormonism floating around in this thread. 

All that aside, I would like to first point out that the name 'Mormon' isn't exactly correct; it's a nickname. The real name of my church is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I suspect the misnomer of 'Mormon' came as a slang term derived from our primary text, The Book of Mormon. Since it's kind of a mouthful to say, "he/she's a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints," I imagine people decided to call us Mormons because it's simple and is easy to associate that name with our beliefs. Whatever the reason, the name stuck. 

With that misconception out of the way, it should be quite evident from seeing the real title of my church that us Mormons are, in fact, Christians. Our primary text, The Book of Mormon, is actually called The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. If you read The Book of Mormon, you should quickly realize that us Mormons are Christians. We believe in Jesus Christ, and we try to follow his example as best we can. 

Us Mormons are also not polygamists. It is true that we practiced polygamy in our history, but we ended that practice over a century ago. Mormon marriages are strictly monogamous. 

I apologize if this post is too unrelated to the OP, but I feel that some of these misconceptions need to be cleared up, in order to have a well-informed discussion about Romney's faith. 

If you have any criticisms about me or my faith, I ask that you keep it civil. I am here for intelligent, civil discussion, not an ideological flamewar. 

Edit 1: Grammar corrections.
And yes, there is plenty of Mormon hatred going around in political forums, and I think it's mostly become an issue for debate because Mitt is a Mormon.
You say this like you want to see some hatred of Mormonism. I'm sorry, I don't care what your political, moral, scientific, religious, or non-religious beliefs are, but I think we can all agree that this world needs a less hate and more understanding between all beliefs. Just a thought 
Well, I apologize for putting words in your mouth. I wasn't trying to sound hostile. That being said, there is a lot of Mormon hatred going out there. It's not necessarily by the news media, but by people like you and I. If you go over to /r/Politics, you will see Romney critics that bash every aspect of his life, Mormonism included.
