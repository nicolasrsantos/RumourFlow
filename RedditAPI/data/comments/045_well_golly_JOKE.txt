And the people who fled the United States, disavowed their Citizenship, and established a polygamous Mormon cult ... they, too, are white Mexicans.

Why do the Romneys hate America?
"Foreigner" is just the closest word to "nigger" they could come up with, and still say it in public.

I want to point out that John McCain was born in motherfucking Panama (no kidding) ... and while birthers hounded Obama in the last election cycle, they ignored McCain.
Is that like how Dracula carries a coffin full of soil from Transylvania to sleep in?
I have no doubt that they view him as a socialist.

I also have no doubt that almost none of them know what socialism is.

They yell out "socialist" and "Saul Alinsky" because they've heard it mentioned on tha teevee.  I'd bet almost none of them know much about either subject.  I'd bet most of them can't spell Saul Alinsky's name correctly.

He's a socialist ... and an (atheist) Marxist communist ... with an evil America-hating Baptist minister at the church he attends ... and he's a secret Muslim.

An atheist Baptist Muslim.
I think that overt racism isn't the majority opinion anymore. Still the subtle framing of racism can take its toll, if the point is hammered home (by referring to Obama as a Kenyan anti-colonialist, as a foreigner, as not Christian, and not truly American).  The drum beats on and on and the pattern seems striking.

I'd say the majority of people don't buy into it.  But it could be worth 10-15 percentage points.  In other words, it could decide an election.

Side note:  Why is anti-colonialism and hatred of British colonizing power such a bad thing?  It makes me wonder if the Tea Party types have any idea about the era from which they draw their zany costumes.  That whole original Tea Party was an anti-colonialist action against Britain ... the very same colonizing force that Kenya (once called British East Africa) rebelled against.

If Obama really is of that mindset, then he should be **the** hands down Tea Party candidate.  They should be in love with him.  But they have no sense of history beyond last week's headlines.
Wait just a second ... 

&gt;I think it might be time to toss ridiculous cries of racism in the same 'Godwin' bucket into which we throw all the "you're a Nazi/worse than Hitler" crap.

So the GOP doesn't use racism in elections anymore, then?  What about [John McCain's "black baby"]( http://www.dadmag.com/archive/060400jmccain.php) during the Republican primaries?  That was clearly the Bush campaign.

High profile, national campaign level Republicans even use racism in primaries against other Republicans - but somehow they wouldn't use it against an actual black guy... a black guy who is an Democrat (the "enemy")?

It is all about picking up percentage points, and the modern GOP doesn't mind a little racism if it lands them a net positive in points at the polls.
Interesting.  That action would seem to alter the meaning of the Constitution then.  So the Senate thought they could do that without a Constitutional Amendment?  Pretty ballsy Senate.
OK, [but remember, you asked for it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5_qhnWByA4)
