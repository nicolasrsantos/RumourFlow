The worst part about this is that the percentage has actually gone *up* throughout Obama's presidency:

[2008 - 12%](http://www.pewresearch.org/2008/07/15/belief-that-obama-is-muslim-is-durable-bipartisan-but-most-likely-to-sway-democratic-votes/) | [2009 - 17%](http://www.pewresearch.org/2009/04/01/no-decline-in-belief-that-obama-is-a-muslim/) | [2010 - 31%](http://www.pewforum.org/2010/08/18/growing-number-of-americans-say-obama-is-a-muslim/)
[:-(.  Republican party affiliation up from 35% in 2008.](http://www.gallup.com/poll/15370/party-affiliation.aspx)

To be fair, it peaked at 49% in November, 2010 (Obamacare. Ermahgerd!!!!) and has been declining since then.  The 35% low is probably because Bush left the party in shambles and is pretty much the 7 year low from 2008 to now.
Seriously?  *That* is what makes Republican voters think that Obama is a secret Muslim?

The United States has a long history of leaving no soldier behind.  Regardless of Bergdahl's actions, he is an American soldier and his country stands behind him when he is behind enemy lines.
&lt;/editorial&gt;
Lost in all of that is that these types of swaps are common.  Bush did it.  Israel does it.  We did it in WW II.  

A story can be fabricated and repeated enough to make it seem like Obama did something horrible here, but really he's following well established precedent.
43%.  [20% of them believe that Obama is the Anti-Christ](http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2011/PPP_Release_National_ConspiracyTheories_040213.pdf)
It's not as funny if I say "the actual percentage is as much as 20 points lower, depending on how many Republicans think Obama is both the Anti-Christ *and* a Muslim".  

Actually, that's pretty funny, too.
Yes, it's true.  [Some people thought Bush was the Antichrist](http://www.abbaswatchman.com/PAGE%206%20BUSH.htm).

**But not 20% of them!!!!!**


Ferret us out a statistic to demonstrate.

e.g. 86% of "conservatives" believe that "the poor have it easy" or 86% of "conservatives" believe global warming is a hoax.  Those are statistics that demonstrate that "conservatives" are clueless idiots.  
Your first comment was basically "I know you are but what am I?"  This one is "I believe it so it must be true".  You're the worst kind of Redditor
