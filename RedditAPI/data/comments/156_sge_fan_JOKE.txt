I had a long converstaion with my friends about this last night. Every country has its fair share of morons and idiots. The main difference between the US and most other countries is that in those other countries the idiots and morons are ashamed of being idiots and morons while in the US they are not only proud of it, they are being celebrated for it. Just take climate change and evolution denieres... these idiots are heroes to large parts of the populations while they are being laughed at in most other countries.

The real shit is that Americans think they have the right to decide who is to rule Egypt.
Wow, being an atheist is now considered being a troll on /r/politics.
They have also failed themselves by being proud of their ignorance.
"That's what Uncle Dad said."
Do you understand how polls work?
Technically speaking (and also in reality) you are an idiot.
It's all dog whistles with GOP.
