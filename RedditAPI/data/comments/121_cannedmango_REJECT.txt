The interesting thing about human behaviour is that by putting the words Obama and Muslim in the same headline is part of the reason why people end up not knowing the truth.  Even though the poster is attempting to clarify people's misconceptions... people just can't seem to stop [remembering false information as truth](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=532202).

No matter what the context, some people will just remember "Obama" and "Muslim" and when they try to remember what the context was, their brain will make the (incorrect) shortcut that Obama is a Muslim.

The lesson to learn from this?  You can better fight misconceptions with [direct positive statements](http://reddit.com/info/6emic/comments/) than with [statements that contest the lie](http://reddit.com/info/6elhh/comments/) even if the content is the same.  Semantics count.
Thanks jones, I was going to post the same thing... lets look at the bigger issue here... people believe (truly believe) that being Muslim is a negative thing.  It makes me weep for the tolerant days of segregation.
degustibus... are you trying to justify your intolerance?  

Yes, those countries are all behind in the civil liberties that their citizens enjoy.  Gee, maybe America should stop selling weapons to Saudi Arabia... [whoops!](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/07/28/us-arms-sale-to-saudi-arabia-in-works/)

ok... we missed the moral high ground there, but surely we wouldn't support a military dictator in ANY country, less yet Pakistan?  [Whoops!!](http://media.www.thehilltoponline.com/media/storage/paper590/news/2005/03/28/NationWorld/U.s-Sells.F16s.To.Pakistan-904116.shtml)

wow.. 0 for 2 so far.  I know, let's take a mostly peaceful country and make people *think* they're terrorists.  Look at this war-torn country... [just look at this sh*thole](http://www.pbase.com/k_amj/throughout_iran&amp;page=all)

Nothing there eh?  I guess the LEAST we can do is to take the peaceful, practicing Muslims in our own country and ostracize them.  Finally!  Now I can sleep with a clear conscience.
The problem with debating (and I use the term loosely) with someone like you is that you put your own interpretation on points that I'm making and create your own argument to reply to. 

Did I say that the US is responsible for those problems?  Did I?  No, I didn't.  So why are you responding to me as if I did?

What I did say is that the US is supporting countries with those problems... yet puts sanctions on other countries.  This sort of decision making seems arbitrary at best to the outside observer, but anyone in the know realizes that it is entirely for political and financial reasons.

YOU were the one who pointed out that there are problems in those countries and that being a Muslim in those countries is not exactly a positive thing.  Well, as I attempted to point out with humour but will now tell you in an easier to digest manner... If your government sponsors other countries that oppress their people with draconian laws, then speak out AGAINST your government and don't further persecute people through ignorance and bigotry simply because they share the same religion as those who would cause them harm in the first place.

I hear you.. you're absolutely right... but I STILL felt compelled to respond in the off chance that some reader with a degustibus-like-mindset should see his response go uncontested and feel like that was some sort of victory.  

Now, I'm not claiming victory for myself here.. I just wanted to clarify that he didn't respond to my post and went off on his own tangent.
