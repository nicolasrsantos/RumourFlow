Depending on where you live, I wouldn't even call $100k upper middle class, although it certainly is in most places in the US.

One of my friends made $50k (ish) a year as a manager at his last job.  He's married to a contractor who makes $60k (ish).  They have two kids.  That $110k they make sounds like a ton of money to current students and recent grads.  But once you start raising a family, you're going to realize that's not a lot of money.  

I'm going to tell them that a decent amount of people on reddit apparently think they're rich.  Along with the two teachers I know who are married to each other and between the two of them, make near 100k.
Since the typical reddit user is a young, recent college grad looking for or just starting a new career, or currently in school, there's a huge disconnect about money here.  It's easy to think 100k is rich when you're making 30k or less, but take a look at the lifestyle of a family earning 100k.  Where I live, two teachers midway in their career can marry each other and they'll be near 100k.  And apparently they're rich.
Upvote, even if $100k isn't rich.
100k a year isn't rich anywhere in the US.  You aren't poor, certainly -- you should be able to live comfortably, and save money -- but 100k being rich dilutes the term "rich" to a great extent.

Take this, for example -- in my hometown, two teachers midway in their careers can marry each other and make close to 100k together, if not that amount.  

This is why Obama and the democrats are pushing for higher taxes on those making $250k or over.  100k isn't even remotely close to rich, although it is upper-middle class unless you live in downtown L.A.
While the definition of what "rich" is will vary between people, $200k is right around the ballpark of where I would start calling people rich (even if I think $250k is a better range).
