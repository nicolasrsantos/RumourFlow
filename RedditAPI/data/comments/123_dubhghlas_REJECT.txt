Obama's Muslim Prayer Curtain
It took 5 seconds on Google Image Search to debunk this. 

*sigh...* family.
Thanks Obama! 
Props accepted! I have fun arguing with my overly conservative family. I have to have fun in order to keep my sanity. 
Yes, they are. I have a heavily conservative family and get to see this shit all the time. 
As far as I can see, no. Searching prayer curtain just brings up this stupid thing. Adding "-obama" to the search does give an answer: some mosques do have a curtain to separate the genders, though there is no one universal design for such a thing.
