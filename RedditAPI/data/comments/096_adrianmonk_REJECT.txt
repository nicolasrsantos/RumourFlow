I don't think the religion of the president matters as long as he does a good job.  But if someone really went to a concerted effort to conceal their true religion (to the point of attending a Christian church for 20 years!), it would be a problem.  Not because their religion matters, but because that would be an intense level of deception.

Luckily, it's all complete hooey in this case...
Sometimes a good way to respond to a question like that is to re-purpose the question, to use the opportunity to take control of the direction of the conversation.  You can still answer the question without dodging it, but in your answer you shift the focus to something else.

Obama could say something like, "You have been misinformed.  I am not, in fact, a Muslim; I am a Christian, and if you research it for yourself, I'm sure you'll find it's true.  Furthermore, if you find you agree, I would encourage you to go back afterward and ask yourself what the source of this information was, and whether other things you've heard from that same source or similar sources need to be re-examined."  The idea is to shift the focus from whether it's good or bad to be a Muslim to the question of where one gets one's information and how reliable it is.
In that context, "less than once percent" means "some number somewhat lower than 1%, but not remarkably lower".

It's a matter of linguistic pragmatics, where the choice you make about which terms to use is as important as the denotation of the terms.

Compare to the phrase "a distance so short it can be expressed in millimeters".  Well, of course, all distances *can* be expressed in millimeters.  The distance from the Earth to the Sun is about 150,000,000,000,000 millimeters.  However, millimeters aren't the most convenient unit to use here, which is the real point:  "it can be expressed in millimeters" is shorthand (and perhaps idiomatic) for "it is convenient to express in millimeters".

It's the same with "less than one percent".  In mathematical terms, it's a bare inequality.  In human language, it means that it's not only true that it's less than one percent, but it also means that that's the strongest statement that is convenient to make considering the information available and considering how concise you need to be.  The implicit assumption is that *if you could just as easily have made a stronger statement, you would have*.

For another example, consider the statement, "I'm hungry."  A mathematically equivalent statement is, "I'm hungry, and the sky is blue."  However, when it comes to human communication, these two statements are not equivalent.  If you said the former to a friend, they might ask, "Want to grab some lunch?".  But if you said the latter to a friend, they might resopnd, "Huh?  What does that mean?".  They know you're getting at something, but they don't know what.  Because human communication is made in a context, and what you choose to include and choose to leave out is important.  The assumption is that if there weren't something significant in your statement, you wouldn't be going to the trouble of making that statement.  Therefore, more or less, every part of that statement is there for a reason.
&gt; Obama is the son of a Muslim

Nitpick:  Isn't he the son of a man *who was raised as a Muslim*?  That's not the same thing as being a Muslim.
&gt; If you're a Muslim, you were raised as a Muslim.

Yes, but the reverse isn't true.  As I understand it, as an adult, Obama's father was an atheist or agnostic.

Snopes seem to [basically agree](http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/muslim.asp).  (Search with the page for the string "family histories" to get to the relevant section.)
&gt; "Obama uses the Muslim Pakistani pronunciation for "Pakistan" rather than the common American one"

Hmm, maybe because he's **educated**?
Adding a qualifier such as "God willing" or "likely" for future events is a [Muslim tradition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insha%27Allah).  It's done to show that you aren't going against God's will, should he have planned something different than what you've stated.

So I would say that it's consistent with the evidence to say the person who wrote this Conservapedia article is a Muslim.
That was added by a vandal, apparently as parody.  Here's the [previous version of the page](http://christopedia.us/w/index.php?title=Barack_Hussein_Obama&amp;oldid=3601), and here are [the diffs](http://christopedia.us/w/index.php?title=Barack_Hussein_Obama&amp;diff=3621&amp;oldid=3601) between it and [the version you saw](http://christopedia.us/w/index.php?title=Barack_Hussein_Obama&amp;oldid=3621).  Also, if you look at [the history](http://christopedia.us/w/index.php?title=Barack_Hussein_Obama&amp;action=history), you can see that [someone named **XenonII**](http://christopedia.us/wiki/User:XenonII) had done tons and tons of edits, and then some [user named **Bhs**](http://christopedia.us/wiki/User:Bhs) came along and did only the last two edits, which were the ones that introduced the "n" word.

Note that older, non-vandalized version is still pretty bad.  I think the vandal was just trying to parody it by carrying it further in the direction it was already going.
According to http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/muslim.asp , which in turn is quoting Barack:

&gt; For my mother, organized religion too often dressed up closed-mindedness in the garb of piety, cruelty and oppression in the cloak of righteousness.  This isn't to say that she provided me with no religious instruction. In her mind, a working knowledge of the world's great religions was a necessary part of any well-rounded education. In our household the Bible, the Koran, and the Bhagavad Gita sat on the shelf alongside books of Greek and Norse and African mythology. On Easter or Christmas Day my mother might drag me to church, just as she dragged me to the Buddhist temple, the chinese New Year celebration, the Shinto shrine, and ancient Hawaiian burial sites. But I was made to understand that such religious samplings required no sustained commitment on my part. Religion was an expression of human culture, she would explain, not its wellspring, just one of the many ways — and not necessarily the best way — that man attempted to control the unknowable and understand the deeper truths about our lives.

So I would say Barack was brought up with the sampler platter of religion.
&gt; Islam is very different from Christianity. We don't have lapsed Muslims like the Catholics do. Your either a practicing believing Muslim or your not a Muslim.

Christianity varies a lot, but there are some Christian denominations that believe approximately the same thing.  The book of James has [a famous section](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2:14-20&amp;version=49) about how faith without works is "dead" and "useless".  Different groups interpret this differently.  Some subscribe to the idea of "once saved, always saved", which basically says that becoming a Christian is a one-time decision that you cannot reverse, and if you fall away, it's obviously very bad but it doesn't mean you're not a Christian anymore.  Other groups say that you can "lose your salvation" if you fall away.
&gt; Or maybe he's secretly a Baptist.

No kidding, when I was a teenager, in about 1985, the youth group at my Baptist church wanted to organize a dance.  We talked to the youth minister about the idea, and he talked to the church leaders about it, but the verdict came back that even though he thought there was nothing wrong with it, we'd probably offend some of the older members of the church.  So no deal, we couldn't have a dance.  The idea of doing a square dance (instead of one with pop/rock music) was put forward, but that wasn't thought to be different enough to matter.

So in case anyone was wondering, there was a time, not all that long ago, when this whole "we're Baptists, we can't dance" thing was for real.

Oh, and I suck at dancing now.  My little joke of an excuse is always, "Well, I was raised as a Baptist."
&gt; Conservepedia uses the abbreviation CP to describe itself

I'm not getting the reference.  You're offended on behalf of the Unix `cp` command?  Probably something else, I'm sure, just not sure what.
