Not only do you need approval from the Legislative branch, but you also need to have someone else lined up to fill the spot.\n\nWhen it comes to Wheeler, even though he seems to be against Net Neutrality, it\u0027s more likely that he\u0027s trying to find a solution that makes everyone happy instead of just sticking it to Telecom companies, like they\u0027ve been doing to us for the past 30+ years. He\u0027s not flat out saying it shouldn\u0027t be a utility, primarily because Telecoms spent billions building the infrastructure, and turning it into a utility would cause major issues with that. \n\nOverall, when it comes to pure qualifications, Wheeler is actually a good choicet for the position, he\u0027s been in the business for years, and knows the ins and outs of it all, but do we know where his loyalties lie? I\u0027d say not, simply because they\u0027re still talking about getting something set up, rather than him just flat out saying that Telecoms get everything and fuck the free internet. That\u0027s not what he\u0027s doing.\n\nNow, at the same time, would another chairman have done the same? Likely not, they would possibly have gone one way or another on the situation and one party would\u0027ve been furious with the decision. To me, that\u0027s not a good option. As much as I dislike what the telecoms have been doing to customers and the near oligarchy they\u0027ve created, just screwing over one side or another isn\u0027t going to make the issue any better, if anything, it\u0027ll make it worse.\n\nUltimately, with everything considered, especially since we can\u0027t, you know *see into people\u0027s souls and minds to discern their intentions*. To many, it looks like Obama goofed and picked a guy who wants to work a deal with the Telecom and the people, rather than just thinking about the people alone. That might actually be the best option though, finding a common ground and working on that is much better than just outright working in the favor of one party.\n\nSo, if you\u0027d like, sure, knock him for that, as well as the other issues that his hands have become tied entirely by the nature of the laws behind the things he\u0027s promised or decided. Blame him for not having foresight, that\u0027s fine.\n\nBut please, let\u0027s be realistic, you can\u0027t assume to know the true intentions of anyone in this world unless you\u0027re telepathic.\n\nWe need to try to be both empathic and sympathetic toward the people in this world in order to cooperate with each other properly, and the kind of thinking that /r/politics and r/technology, hell anything relating to the governments actions,  seems to have adopted these past few years, is exactly the opposite of the kind of logic we should be using to solve these issues.\n\nCasting blame does nothing. Complaining on the internet, does nothing. Want to make a difference? Want things to change? Work with your senator and get things done, through cooperation and effort.

Misguided and incompetent regulation combined with utilities that found ways to game the system resulted in what had been the best communication system in the world becoming just so-so, though very profitable. We as consumers were consistently sold ideas that were impractical only to have those be replaced later by less-ambitious technologies that, in turn, were still under-delivered. Congress set mandates then provided little or no oversight. The FCC was (and probably still is) managed for the benefit of the companies and their lobbyists, not for you and me. And the upshot is that I could move to Japan and pay $14 per month for 100-megabit-per-second Internet service but I can\u0027t do that here and will probably never be able to.\nDespite this, the FCC says America has the highest broadband deployment rate in the world and President Bush has set a goal of having broadband available to every U.S. home by the end of this year. What have these guys been smoking? Nothing, actually, they simply redefined \"broadband\" as any Internet service with a download speed of 200 kilobits per second or better.

I\u0027ll leave the original misinterpretation in after the line, but here\u0027s the updated response.\n\nNetflix uses just under 1 gb per hour on medium quality, per user.  This is ~150 gallons per hour.  This is the same as flushing a toilet 94 times in the same period or once every 38 seconds.\n\nPower users use more because they\u0027re doing more in parallel.  Browsers use less providing they\u0027re not watching videos.\n\n------------------------\n\nI agree, but have you tried explaining abstract thoughts such as electronic signals or microscopic magnet orientation as volume to a congressman?\n\nWe can get this down much, much more by eliminating white spaces (but not text spaces) on print, using 8pt font, double siding, no margins, thiner paper, smaller pages, etc.  \n\nThe smallest \"reasonable\" font fits 500 words into 320x240 pixels.  \n\nIf we translate this directly to DPI such that each dot is a single pixel, we can use a standard laser printer to achieve 600dpi or a commercial model (using HP, for reference) for 1200dpi.  Let\u0027s use the commercial version since we\u0027re condensing.\n\n320 dots x 240 dots (area) per 500 words is roughly 154 dots^2 per word.  \n\n1200x1200 \u003d 1440000 dots^2  per inch^2 / 154 dots^2 \u003d 9350 words per square inch.\n\nYou could then fit all 100,000 words onto a single 3x4\" post it note with room to spare, one sided.  Let\u0027s assume the sticky portion is unusable and the entirety of the post-it, front and back, can fit 2 books.\n\nEach post it has a volume of 3 x 4 x (0.05mm paper thickness \u003d\u003d 0.0019685 inches) \u003d 0.023622 cubic inches.\n\n1 Gallon \u003d 231 / 0.023622 \u003d 9779 x 2 \u003d 19558 books, or  10.89 gigabytes.  \n\nThe 156 gallons of water is now worth 1.7 terabytes of internet.\n\nYou can achieve further density by using thinner paper and using compression techniques.  Given a reasonable compression of 75% increases the volume of data by 4x.\n\nBut 156 gallons is more fun.  I like to think of a truck dumping a library on your house when your kids are watching youtube.\n\n\n\n\n","duration":"","id":815,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_clyo7zj","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":814,"links":[813],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"aoxkrigan","label":"I dont think this math checks out...data doesnt really translate well into actual physical volume.

I get the impression that his knee-jerk reaction to everything Obama does it to oppose it weather it makes sense or not.  I\u0027d be willing to guess if Obama came out strongly against Net Neutrality (for some reason) Ted would be all for it.\n\n**So in response to his idiocy leak:**\n\n\u0026gt;It puts the government in charge of determining Internet pricing...\n\nNo, that will still be at the discretion of the ISP, they just can\u0027t charge you or those you connect with more based on their **opinion** on how you use your connection.\n\n\u0026gt;...terms of service, and what types of products and services can be delivered, leading to fewer choices, fewer opportunities, and higher prices for consumers.\n\nExactly the opposite.  It put the **CONSUMER** in charge of what types of products and services can be delivered.  You don\u0027t put car manufacturers in charge of what you can buy from Walmart because consumers drive to the store in their car, why should an ISP control what other companies you\u0027re \"allowed to \" do business with or how well that business works?\n\n\u0026gt;The Internet should not operate at the speed of government.\n\nI\u0027m sure this was intended to imply a bureaucratic slowing but it\u0027s quite the opposite.  Without ISPs acting as big brother blocking or slowing things they don\u0027t like, everything should function at the maximum possible speed the network allows.  There would be no overheard in watching and controlling.  Everything would work more simply and fairly.\n\nThe bottom line is I don\u0027t want to give a company the power to simply disallow competition and in some Orwellian double-think call it the \"free market\".\n\nI think I speak for the whole of the internet when I say: **\"Fuck you Ted Cruz.

First of all, *get what done*?  Ok, I\u0027m aware of all the things Obama puts on his resume (including health care plans from the conservative think tanks of yesteryear), but for the people expecting hope and change they are just utterly insufficient scraps of nonsense.  Can you honestly tell me that this country has veered away from the disastrous course set during George W. Bush\u0027s terms in office?  I suppose it might be an open question as to whether he is just weak and incompetent or appeasing powerful special interests while managing the outraged millennial generation (personally, I\u0027m convinced that he works for a Wall Street PR agency).  But the fact that he has made no real progress and that this country is still off the goddamn rails seems pretty self-evident to me.  And now, look, here we are; Obama\u0027s a valiant underdog in the unwinnable battle to prevent Comcast from dominating the internet for maximum profits.  What a fucking surpise.\n\n But here\u0027s the real problem with that statement - **we only \"have to compromise\" when the country is ostensibly in a good position to make progressive reforms**.  As soon as the country rejects President Cheney\u0027s reign of terror and elects someone who\u0027s campaigned on *not* turning us into the United States of the Superrich and Everyone Else Who\u0027s Probably a Terrorist Anyway, then all of a sudden it\u0027s all \"Time to compromise!\", \"Hold on, let\u0027s be bipartisan about this!\", and \"Ow! Ow! The Republicans are hurting me!\".  \n\nDon\u0027t you remember how things ran under George W. Bush?  You\u0027d get 25 minutes to read the Patriot Act, and if you didn\u0027t like it you were an unamerican terrorist sympathizer!  Where was all the need for bipartisanship then? Oh wait, we didn\u0027t need any obstructionism because we were just openly doing exactly what the rich want.\n\nI don\u0027t buy it.  I don\u0027t buy any of it.  The wealthiest few are 100% in control of this country.  Our government is a show designed to make the people think they have a voice and prevent them from revolting.  Let\u0027s all stop pretending.  This country does not belong to the people.

Internet service right now is already severely limited. In most municipal areas, you have one choice for high speed internet. Why? Because no city wants a fiber optic line for comcast AND for charter AND for time warner. It would turn into a nightmare for both municipal and corporate maintenance. Because of this, we see approximately zero competition on any broadband service anywhere in the country, except in the case of google, which has found that, while it is possible to install a second network, it isn\u0027t profitable enough to pursue for much more than the good PR earns them since they seem like they are merciful saviors compared to comcast \u0026amp; co.\n\nISPs in the US are monoplies in each of their local areas and charge accordingly. Their profit margins are astronomical, despite repeated consumer complaints of unethical business practices, poor customer service, and a slow, sub-standard product. The sad truth is that *we have no choice* in getting access to internet.\n\nThis is why Title II was created. Back in the 1930s, when electricity and water service became a mature, widespread product, people started to see the very same monopolistic tendencies and the government intervened. \n\nI read some of your other comments, and while I agree that water regulation has issues (we should encourage people to live in wet, fertile areas), I know that electricity and internet do not have nearly the same kind of overhead involved in providing service. Internet  is absolutely critical to the advancement of the human race, and it should not be something controlled by money-grubbing monopolies, thus the government should classify it as a utility.","duration":"","id":1260,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_clyxlnn","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1179,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"terrymasters","label":"\"Do you really want the Internet to be treated like a utility?

It has been shaped by crony capitalist policies with content providers and the ISPs themselves having the loudest voice.  The average consumer is not engaged in the process, is apathetic, and/or has no way of voicing any meaningful concern.  So real competition is not happening.  We are seeing ISPs conspiring with each other to maintain their own marketshare and avoid competing. We are seeing ISPs manipulate and bicker with governments over right-of-way and other access issues.  We are seeing ISPs complain because some competitors got grant dollars to build out infrastructure in rural areas that are underserved, or go before Congress to convince them that Net Neutrality is like \"Obamacare for the internet\".  We are seeing what used to be a \"wild west internet\" circa 2001 (No monthly data caps, minimal copyright enforcement, no logging or monitoring of activity without a warrant) become a bloated shithole of regulation benefiting the content providers/ISPs and dis-empowering the individual user. \n\nIf we could somehow uninstall the current regulations that set up this scenario, a truly \"free market\" may just work.

Yes that is an ad hominem, but really it is the truth. If you apply that simple of a logic to it then it is going to be true, but economics and the relationship between society and the state are extremely complex, and there are huge swaths of economic theory that have never panned out when put up to the rigors of scientific observation.\n\nYou are ignoring natural monopolies and the fact that often ISPs such as Comcast will make cities sign a monopoly or they will just deny service. They can afford to do that at this point. If you do not play their game then you are fucked. The same goes for any other company that wants to put internet into someplace new. If they have to spend hundreds of millions or billions of dollars to lay the infrastructure then it is prudent of them to try and prevent competition.\n\nEither way you are going to have to have regulation to prevent it. Either you dictate that all internet infrastructure is common, and anyone can use it to provide service, or you mandate from a high enough level (probably the state at the least, most likely the federal level) that cities and municipalities can NOT sign monopoly contracts with ISPs and prevent other ISPs from coming in. The second option is inherently anti-libertarian in that it is a massive mandate from a central authority restricting the freedoms of smaller entities, and it isn\u0027t even that effective because again, the market will dictate a first cross the finish line approach. Why would I want to compete in a market where my initial investment is going to be huge, only to have to have a competition for price with an already established player in that market? Instead I will look for a virgin market and try and get there first because I know that the other guy is probably going to have the same logic as me if they are an equal competitor. God forbid if they are not an equal competitor because then they can just undercut me and take a loss on that local market till I can no longer afford to compete in, attempt to buy me out, or deny access to their peering networks, all of which would just re-established a natural monopoly (and this baring the fact that I am attempting to establish a monopoly in the first place).","duration":"","id":1328,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_clysv4d","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1326,"links":[1325],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"eternityablaze","label":"A regulation is a limitation of options.

The worst possible outcomes of Federal intervention have already occurred.  \n\nMeanwhile, I have a choice of one cable company for a broadband ISP, and they have built-in censorship of certain material, a robust \"threaten and sanction DMCA violators\" approach, 15Mbps down/2Mbps up transfer speeds, and a 250GB monthly data cap.  \n\nSo what have we got to lose at this point?  I say reclassify internet as a utility, at least until such a time that real competition exists.  What we have now is not a \"market\" of ISPs.  Existing rules and policies (DMCA, non-compete structure of cable companies) keep the deck stacked against the consumer.  \n\nUntil competing providers are allowed to come out and create their own territory, offer end-to-end encryption of all traffic and no logging, shred incoming DMCA complaints, and offer true symmetrical broadband speeds without caps, I would say we don\u0027t really have a truly free market in place.  The internet should be the wild west but it is starting to look more like Pay-per-view.

How about other industries or companies that I don\u0027t like? I really don\u0027t like that Whole Foods offers homeopathic \u0027remedies\u0027 to their customers, can I make them stop? Consumer preference should drive the market, not the government. \n\nWe\u0027re talking about the **FCC**. The FCC *doesn\u0027t regulate power, trash, or water companies*. It regulates media companies: broadcast, telephone, ect. It is called the Federal Communications Commission. Not the Federal Public Utilities Commission. Your trash and water are local functions. So is the majority of regulations on your power company. Your landline telephone is regulated by the FCC. So is your AM/FM radio. \n\nExample of a company regulated by the FCC: Comcast, Sprint\n\nExample of a public utility not regulated by the FCC: Xcel Energy, Waste Management Inc. \n* Ironically, if you want more \u0027bandwidth\u0027 from your power company you can get it. They will install as large of a line that you can pay for. If you exceed the limit of your line, you have to pay to get a bigger one. \n*same goes for your trash company. If you want a pickup every week, every day, or twice a day you can *pay extra* and get that service.
