Here is from my friend Shawn, who is a patent examiner:\n-----------------------------\nI am sick and tired reading this nonsense about patent conspiracy re Jacob Rotschild, Freescale, and 4 Chinese inventors who were on the Malaysian flight 370. It was published in many online sites last month and now this nonsense started circulating over email. Here are some real facts (I am surprised that press didn\u0027t check them before publishing their \"sensational\" stories). 1. Any western company requires their employees to assign ALL rights fro their inventions/patents to the company name. All that employees get is a bonus payment when the patent is granted (issued by US patent office). The payment is typically between $1K and $3K depending on the company. Freescale Semiconductor is no exception, all patents filed by its employees belong to the company. 2. The ONLY US patent recently issued by these 4 Chinese employees mentioned in the press is US Patent #8,671,381 (\"System for optimizing number of dies produced on a wafer\"), which is about minor improvement in manufacturing process. ALL rights to this patent were assigned Freescale Semiconductor. You can easily check these facts yourself by doing patent search on patft.uspto.gov\n\nTherefore, the whole conspiracy theory falls apart: Freescale Semiconductor lost 4 employees and didn\u0027t gain anything from this loss. They already had all rights to this (minor) patent even before it was filed.\n\n--------------------------\n","duration":"","id":43,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cgql6po","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Rothschild fingerprints on the missing Malaysian Airlines Jet: Four days after the missing flight MH370 a \"HF RADAR\" patent is approved by the Patent Office for Freescale Semiconductor of Austin TX. 4 of the 5 Patent holders were on that plane, the 5th owner who wasn\u0027t, is Jacob Rothschild.","label":"tatonkanator","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_20f99r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.394852479E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.397343058E9,"simScore":0.6454233035441761,"sentiment":"  Positive"},{"index":44,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"totes_meta_bot","label":"This thread has been linked to from elsewhere on reddit.\n\n\n - [/r/ZOG] [X-post r/conspiracy: Missing Malaysian Airlines Jet: Four days after the missing flight MH370 a \u0026amp;quot;HF RADAR\u0026amp;quot; patent is approved by the Patent Office for Freescale Semiconductor of Austin TX. 4 of the 5 Patent holders were on that plane, the 5th owner who wasn\u0026amp;#x27;t, is Jacob Rothschild](http://np.reddit.com/r/ZOG/comments/20fgdb/xpost_rconspiracy_missing_malaysian_airlines_jet/)\n\n\n - [/r/unfitness] [Zoinks there is a mystery afoot](http://np.reddit.com/r/unfitness/comments/20h02a/zoinks_there_is_a_mystery_afoot/)\n\n*^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^Comments? ^Complaints?
