Even so, the fact remains that the fire alarm system suffered damage in the bombing. Rather than just repair the damage, they began a complete overhaul of the system throughout the complex, deciding that the opportunity was there to replace and upgrade the pre-93 system that had been in place since a fire in the mid-70s. \n\nThe work was done in phases. Phase one was replacing the master fire alarm panel (Cerberus Pyrotronics MXL-V, Cerberus Pyrotronics MXL-VR remote transponder panels, and amplifier cabinets) between 1995-97. Phase two was transfering monitoring and control of the existing system over to the new one, and this work happened alongside the install of Phase 1. \n\nPhase 3 was the replacement of **all** fire detection devices throughout WTC complex. None of this work in each individual building was any better than 80% complete on 9/11, and this is the ongoing work which I refer to in my earlier post. The system in place *was* opperational, it was a mix of older equipment with newer equipment gradually being installed and integrated. \n\nThere were work crews in and out of every nook, cranny, closet, and cubby hole of that complex between Feb \u002793 and Sep \u002701.

He had the longest speech, he went on and on.  I\u0027ve never seen such a hate-filled speech in reality in my life, except on documentaries and tv.  This guy called for the extermination of Muslims worldwide.  He said we need to kill women and children in their homes, Muslim women and children.  He spoke the longest out of anyone, easily 10-15 minutes.  And you know what?  They applauded, they applauded like I\u0027ve never seen.  I just came back from Fallujah, and fighting against and for these people, and I was disgusted with what he said.  And here are all the crowd, all the politicians cheering for the extermination of all Muslims.  Never in all my life.  So as soon as they were done applauding I went on about how they were all fucking brainwashed, and it was horrible, and I was fucking loud about it.  I wanted everyone to hear, I just came back from Iraq and I wasn\u0027t as hateful as they were, and fuck them as Americans for being so.  It was literally like Nazi-Germany hit America.\n\nPeople are outraged, they want revenge.  If you want another example of this, the black community is outraged right now over 1 person attacking them.  They\u0027re angry at everyone who isn\u0027t them, for the actions of one person.  It\u0027s the same exact thing.  Muslims as a whole are not responsible for the actions of a few.

When I used to do history class, our teacher would explain how in mainland Europe they used to have witch hunts, and if you were accused it was effectively the same thing as being declared guilty, since you\u0027d be murdered either way. He used to talk like humanity was still in the dark ages back then, but the reality is that it was only a few centuries ago. I don\u0027t think all that much has changed, except the nutcases in charge who are manipulating people to think insane things like this, now have access to communicative platforms that can cover the entire surface of the planet.\n\nAnd even worse, the normal, sane people who want to tell you that you\u0027re being manipulated, don\u0027t have that access so they can\u0027t be heard. For centuries we had no voice or platform at all, and then along came the internet. For the first time all the people wondering why they have to endure this madness had a means to come together and speak out. \n\nBut now they are coming for the internet too, because it scares the shit out of them that people might organise themselves and spread information which is harmful to the status quo. This place is genuinely one of the last bastions of free thought left. You can\u0027t write anti-establishment stuff on mainstream media forums any more, and you can\u0027t even do it on most political forums. Where the rules themselves don\u0027t permit them to censor your words, they just use other means like falsely reporting your threads for abuse, downvoting you etc...\n\nThe bottom line is that if we lose the internet it\u0027s all over.","duration":"","id":42,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_csda6u4","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":41,"links":[40],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Ago_Solvo","label":"Up above users posted a documentary of some Englismen, or an Englishman claiming very much, and even more of what was going on.

The former co-creator or creator of the Guardian Angels came up after all these politicians who spoke, he was the creator of that street vigilante group that used to fight crime.  He had the longest speech, he went on and on.  I\u0027ve never seen such a hate-filled speech in reality in my life, except on documentaries and tv.  This guy called for the extermination of Muslims worldwide.  He said we need to kill women and children in their homes, Muslim women and children.  He spoke the longest out of anyone, easily 10-15 minutes.  And you know what?  They applauded, they applauded like I\u0027ve never seen.  I just came back from Fallujah, and fighting against and for these people, and I was disgusted with what he said.  And here are all the crowd, all the politicians cheering for the extermination of all Muslims.  Never in all my life.  So as soon as they were done applauding I went on about how they were all fucking brainwashed, and it was horrible, and I was fucking loud about it.  I wanted everyone to hear, I just came back from Iraq and I wasn\u0027t as hateful as they were, and fuck them as Americans for being so.  It was literally like Nazi-Germany hit America.\n\nPeople are outraged, they want revenge.  If you want another example of this, the black community is outraged right now over 1 person attacking them.  They\u0027re angry at everyone who isn\u0027t them, for the actions of one person.  It\u0027s the same exact thing.  Muslims as a whole are not responsible for the actions of a few.  No one group is responsible for the actions of 1 individual or a few individuals.","duration":"","id":41,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_cscigh4","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":40,"links":[39],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"escapefromdigg","label":"Fair enough, thanks for sharing.

Lauro Chavez, Ambassador Joe Wilson and his wife Valerie Plame, The Washington DC Madame, Kurt Sonnenfeld, and Barry Jennings. If this had been an actual attack by Terrorists, why would the Government lock these people up for trying to warn their superiors that something was going on? And getting locked up wasn\u0027t the only thing they had to worry about. The DC Madame hung herself in a shed behind her house after just appearing on Alex Jones where she was specifically asked if she was planning on killing herself to which she replied, \"Absolutely not. If they find me dead, they murdered me.\" Barry Jennings was in WTC7 when the explosions started going off as he was trying to escape the building in the stairwell, there was a massive explosion that demolished the stairwell landing trapping him in the building. This happened before the Twin Towers came down. Barry was interviewed as soon as he escaped the building by a news crew and he talked about explosives in the building and then later gave the producers of Loose Change an interview, describing in detail the explosives and the damage. He then tried to rescind his permission for the interview before going into hiding and then winding up dead. \n\nAlso, the 9/11 Commission Members themselves, all stated that the Commission were not allowed to see evidence or interview certain witnesses such as Kalid Shiek Mohammed, who was the supposed \"Architect of 9/11\" and that the Commission was set up to fail.\n\n9/11 COMMISSIONERS\n\nThe co-chairs of the 9/11 Commission (Thomas Keane and Lee Hamilton) said that the CIA (and likely the White House) “obstructed our investigation”.\n\nThe co-chairs of the 9/11 Commission also said that the 9/11 Commissioners knew that military officials misrepresented the facts to the Commission, and the Commission considered recommending criminal charges for such false statements, yet didn’t bother to tell the American people (free subscription required).\n\nIndeed, the co-chairs of the Commission now admit that the Commission largely operated based upon political considerations.\n\n9/11 Commission co-chair Lee Hamilton says “I don’t believe for a minute we got everything right”, that the Commission was set up to fail, that people should keep asking questions about 9/11, that the 9/11 debate should continue, and that the 9/11 Commission report was only “the first draft” of history.\n\n9/11 Commissioner Bob Kerrey said that “There are ample reasons to suspect that there may be some alternative to what we outlined in our version . . . We didn’t have access . . . .”\n\n9/11 Commissioner Timothy Roemer said “We were extremely frustrated with the false statements we were getting”\n\nFormer 9/11 Commissioner Max Cleland resigned from the Commission, stating: “It is a national scandal”; “This investigation is now compromised”; and “One of these days we will have to get the full story because the 9-11 issue is so important to America. But this White House wants to cover it up”.\n\n9/11 Commissioner John Lehman said that “We purposely put together a staff that had – in a way – conflicts of interest“.\n\nThe Senior Counsel to the 9/11 Commission (John Farmer) who led the 9/11 staff’s inquiry, said “I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described …. The tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years…. This is not spin. This is not true.”\n\nhttp://www.infowars.com/the-911-whistleblowers/","duration":"","id":70,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_csbo3vn","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":69,"links":[1],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"mylon","label":"For that many people to be involved it\u0027s hard to imagine they\u0027d all keep their traps shut.

Granted, none of these people were \"in on it.\" but they saw evidence of an \"inside job\" or Government complicity in the attacks. Sibol Edmunds, Susan Lindauer, Sgt. Lauro Chavez, Ambassador Joe Wilson and his wife Valerie Plame, The Washington DC Madame, Kurt Sonnenfeld, and Barry Jennings. If this had been an actual attack by Terrorists, why would the Government lock these people up for trying to warn their superiors that something was going on? And getting locked up wasn\u0027t the only thing they had to worry about. The DC Madame hung herself in a shed behind her house after just appearing on Alex Jones where she was specifically asked if she was planning on killing herself to which she replied, \"Absolutely not. If they find me dead, they murdered me.\" Barry Jennings was in WTC7 when the explosions started going off as he was trying to escape the building in the stairwell, there was a massive explosion that demolished the stairwell landing trapping him in the building. This happened before the Twin Towers came down. Barry was interviewed as soon as he escaped the building by a news crew and he talked about explosives in the building and then later gave the producers of Loose Change an interview, describing in detail the explosives and the damage. He then tried to rescind his permission for the interview before going into hiding and then winding up dead. \n\nAlso, the 9/11 Commission Members themselves, all stated that the Commission were not allowed to see evidence or interview certain witnesses such as Kalid Shiek Mohammed, who was the supposed \"Architect of 9/11\" and that the Commission was set up to fail.\n\n9/11 COMMISSIONERS\n\nThe co-chairs of the 9/11 Commission (Thomas Keane and Lee Hamilton) said that the CIA (and likely the White House) “obstructed our investigation”.\n\nThe co-chairs of the 9/11 Commission also said that the 9/11 Commissioners knew that military officials misrepresented the facts to the Commission, and the Commission considered recommending criminal charges for such false statements, yet didn’t bother to tell the American people (free subscription required).\n\nIndeed, the co-chairs of the Commission now admit that the Commission largely operated based upon political considerations.\n\n9/11 Commission co-chair Lee Hamilton says “I don’t believe for a minute we got everything right”, that the Commission was set up to fail, that people should keep asking questions about 9/11, that the 9/11 debate should continue, and that the 9/11 Commission report was only “the first draft” of history.\n\n9/11 Commissioner Bob Kerrey said that “There are ample reasons to suspect that there may be some alternative to what we outlined in our version . . . We didn’t have access . . . .”\n\n9/11 Commissioner Timothy Roemer said “We were extremely frustrated with the false statements we were getting”\n\nFormer 9/11 Commissioner Max Cleland resigned from the Commission, stating: “It is a national scandal”; “This investigation is now compromised”; and “One of these days we will have to get the full story because the 9-11 issue is so important to America. But this White House wants to cover it up”.\n\n9/11 Commissioner John Lehman said that “We purposely put together a staff that had – in a way – conflicts of interest“.\n\nThe Senior Counsel to the 9/11 Commission (John Farmer) who led the 9/11 staff’s inquiry, said “I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described …. The tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years…. This is not spin. This is not true.”\n\nhttp://www.infowars.com/the-911-whistleblowers/","duration":"","id":70,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_csbo3vn","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":69,"links":[1],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"mylon","label":"For that many people to be involved it\u0027s hard to imagine they\u0027d all keep their traps shut.

The question quoted says, \"When you had **that order** given, I think it was by the president, that **authorized the shooting down of commercial aircraft** that were suspected to be controlled by terrorists, were you there?\" If Cheney said, \"the orders still stand,\" doesn\u0027t that mean he is CONFIRMING the ability to shoot down commercial aircraft, per the president\u0027s authorization? Am I missing where it says that \"the orders\" are NOT to shoot?\n\n\u0026gt; 9) Who really gained?\n\nI completely agree that the government exploited the events of 9/11 enormously, including to ends that had nothing to do with it, such as the invasion of Iraq. But exploiting events for your own agenda in no way proves that you staged them: it\u0027s just political business as usual. If, as many contend, 9/11 was staged to invade Iraq, why was it apparently carried out by 19 Saudis? It would make much more sense to have evidence pointing at Iraq. \n\n\u0026gt; 10) The bodies of Phillip Marshall, his two children, and the family dog were found on February 2, and officials quickly determined it was a murder-suicide. But the Washington, D.C.-based Wayne Madsen Report (WMR) has found evidence that contradicts the official finding.\n\nMarshall doesn\u0027t appear to have said anything particularly about 9/11 that many others haven\u0027t said. While the murder-suicide certainly appears suspicious, Marshall appears to have [moved in a number of other circles](http://21stcenturywire.com/2013/02/28/philip-marshall-murder-suicide-a-lack-of-evidence/), including drug-related ones, which might equally well have had an interest in silencing him.

The Vans were from a company called Urban Moving Systems and they had a mural painted on the side showing the Twin Towers with a plane flying into them on fire.

It is also very interesting to note that bin Laden regularly attended lectures from Mohammed Qutb, brother of Sayyid.\n\nHere is Karen Armstrong, who has wrote several books about Islam and would know a bit about the different sects, claiming that bin Laden was more influenced by Qutb than Wahhabi ideology. She also goes into why it\u0027s important that we actually look into the true influences behind this type of thinking, so there is also stuff about the IRA that isn\u0027t important to this particular point.\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/jul/11/northernireland.july7\n\nhttps://sinningslave.wordpress.com/2006/10/03/is-osama-bin-laden-really-a-wahhabi/\n\nThis is also a pretty good essay on the roots of bin Laden\u0027s faith. It is a good read, but I will admit not terribly well sourced. It does fit in line with other pieces of evidence.\n\nLastly, even the beliefs and ideology section on Wiki, which is heavily sourced in this case, makes no mention of him being Wahhabi.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden#Beliefs_and_ideology\n\nThe full article also explains his differences from Wahhabi ideology.

There were actually two vans, one of them had explosives and the other one was blown up by the occupants of the van as they were escaping. The Vans were from a company called Urban Moving Systems and they had a mural painted on the side showing the Twin Towers with a plane flying into them on fire. The Israeli\u0027s that were arrested were Mossad Agents and not only did the vans and all of the evidence disappear but the Israeli\u0027s were not charged and were sent back to Israel. They later appeared on Israeli TV where they told the interviewer that they were there to document the event. That means they had foreknowledge of the attacks and considering the fact that the vans were full of explosives, they were obviously not just there to document, they were there to participate.

The question quoted says, \"When you had that order given, I think it was by the president, that authorized the shooting down of commercial aircraft that were suspected to be controlled by terrorists, were you there?\" If Cheney said, \"the orders still stand,\" doesn\u0027t that mean he is CONFIRMING the ability to shoot down commercial aircraft, per the president\u0027s authorization? Am I missing where it says that \"the orders\" are NOT to shoot?*\n\nIf the order was to shoot down the plane, then why was it not carried out? They had plenty of time, they knew exactly where the plane was and they had the assets to do it. But judging by the way the question was worded by the assistant, you have to assume that the order was NOT to shoot the plane down. This one is pretty much speculation so there is no way to prove anything one way or the other without an admission of guilt from someone.\n\n*9) Who really gained?\nI completely agree that the government exploited the events of 9/11 enormously, including to ends that had nothing to do with it, such as the invasion of Iraq.

Again, more speculation. We have no idea who murdered him but if it wasn\u0027t the Government and it was suspected that he was murdered, why would the cops call it a murder/suicide? Also, shortly after his death, FBI Agents showed up at his house and removed all of his computers and boxes of other evidence. Who gave them permission to do that?

Despite all the surface appearances in Saudi Arabia – the skyscrapers, glitzy shopping malls, and other ostensible symbols of modernity – Wahhabis are explicitly anti-modern.**\n\n**While calling for a return to the practices of the Prophet Mohammad and his early disciples, they shun anything that in their view contradicts the Prophet’s teachings. That includes gender equality, liberal dress, drinking, music, dance, and religious pluralism. Although not always politically radical, their views have been interpreted to justify violence against non-Wahhabi Muslims and non-Muslims. Their worldview has played a key role in the radicalization of men and women the world over, with a notable example being the late Osama Bin Laden. The Islamic State also owes its ideological basis to Wahhabism. It is, then, important to understand the history of Wahhabism, its role in Saudi society and politics, and the existential threat it poses to the region and the world.**\n\nhttp://global-politics.co.uk/wp/2015/02/08/wahhabis-and-saudis-a-marriage-of-politics-and-piety-2/\n\nFurther support here from the Oxford University Press:-\n\n**Wahhabi Islam**\n\n**From Revival and Reform to Global Jihad.**\n\n**In this book Natana DeLong-Bas offers an in-depth study of the written works of al-Wahhab and demonstrates how it has been distorted into the extremist ideology now propagated by Osama bin Laden and his followers. Through a close reading of al-Wahhab\u0027s texts she demonstrates that many aspects of 20th- and 21st- century Wahhabi extremism do not have their origins in his writings but were added to Wahhabi teachings in the 19th century.**\n\nhttps://global.oup.com/academic/product/wahhabi-islam-9780195333015?cc\u003dgb\u0026amp;lang\u003den\u0026amp;\n\nAnd further support here, from the British mainstream press:-\n\n**Wahhabism: A deadly scripture.**\n\n**But concerns are growing within Muslim circles about the increased reach of Wahhabism, Saudi\u0027s obscurantist and intolerant form of Islam in which Osama Bin Laden has his roots.**\n\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/wahhabism-a-deadly-scripture-398516.html\n\n\u0026gt; The full article also explains his differences from Wahhabi ideology.\n\nBin Laden was a devout believer in the writings of Muhammad bin Abd-al-Wahab, the founder of Wahhabi ideology.

There were actually two vans, one of them had explosives and the other one was blown up by the occupants of the van as they were escaping. The Vans were from a company called Urban Moving Systems and they had a mural painted on the side showing the Twin Towers with a plane flying into them on fire. The Israeli\u0027s that were arrested were Mossad Agents and not only did the vans and all of the evidence disappear but the Israeli\u0027s were not charged and were sent back to Israel. They later appeared on Israeli TV where they told the interviewer that they were there to document the event. That means they had foreknowledge of the attacks and considering the fact that the vans were full of explosives, they were obviously not just there to document, they were there to participate.

They had plenty of time, they knew exactly where the plane was and they had the assets to do it. But judging by the way the question was worded by the assistant, you have to assume that the order was NOT to shoot the plane down. This one is pretty much speculation so there is no way to prove anything one way or the other without an admission of guilt from someone.\n\n*9) Who really gained?\nI completely agree that the government exploited the events of 9/11 enormously, including to ends that had nothing to do with it, such as the invasion of Iraq.

Again, more speculation. We have no idea who murdered him but if it wasn\u0027t the Government and it was suspected that he was murdered, why would the cops call it a murder/suicide? Also, shortly after his death, FBI Agents showed up at his house and removed all of his computers and boxes of other evidence. Who gave them permission to do that? Why were they taken if it was in fact a murder/suicide? Case closed so there should be no reason to take his stuff.

He could sit home and enjoy his wealth and drive a Mercedes Benz but he gave all of that up to Kill Americans (well, Kill FOR Americans first and then Kill Americans. You just can\u0027t trust these guys.) Using his vast spy network (and a few calls to his buddies at the CIA), He got wind of the War Games happening on 9/11 so he planned his operation for when the military would be unprepared. Then he would recruit 19 Saudis who just happened to get their Visa Fast Tracked even though most of them should have not been allowed to fly to the US. The 19 Saudis would train at a variety of flight schools, including US military Bases without anyone catching on. (Except for all of the FBI Agents who reported it to the superiors only to be told to mind your own business.) Then on 9/11, they successfully highjack 4 airliners without incident. They swept into the cockpit so fast. Not a single pilot squawked the highjack code. And then 3 of the planes hit their targets and the 4th wouldn\u0027t have been stopped by the military either but luckily that plane was full of Patriots who took back the plane and crashed it into a field. (Wouldn\u0027t that make a great Die Hard Movie? McClain is on a plane that gets highjacked so he kills the terrorists, takes back the plane and crashes it into the side of a mountain killing everyone. The End.). With 2 of the planes, they leveled the entire World Trade Center Complex, mostly targeting Insurance Brokers and Auditors at both the WTC and the Pentagon.  And then for over 10 years, he managed to elude the most powerful nation on the planet while sending out videos and audio messages on CNN and suffering from complete kidney failure and a variety of other serious health issues. That is until we tortured the fuck out of some Muslim who gave up Bin Laden\u0027s hideout and then it was on like Donkey Kong. Seal Team 6 swooped down from Stealth Helicopters. Bin Laden saw them coming and threw one of his shoes into the Helicopters rotors, taking out one of the Helicopters. Seal Team 6 stormed the compound, killing everyone as they leveled up to Bin Laden\u0027s Level. They busted into his room where he was jacking off one last time to his American Porn Stash. They shot him 1500 times before he could bust a bit, which is a shame because they needed a DNA sample because no one is going to believe they really killed him. They took the body and flew it out to sea where he was buried according to Islamic Tradition because we\u0027re righteous crusaders.

There was never anything to tie these people to 9/11 and initial reports of explosives were subsequently retracted as false.*\n\nIt wasn\u0027t the dancing that proved guilt so much as the arrest of these Israeli\u0027s on the George Washington Bridge in a van full of explosives. There were actually two vans, one of them had explosives and the other one was blown up by the occupants of the van as they were escaping. The Vans were from a company called Urban Moving Systems and they had a mural painted on the side showing the Twin Towers with a plane flying into them on fire. The Israeli\u0027s that were arrested were Mossad Agents and not only did the vans and all of the evidence disappear but the Israeli\u0027s were not charged and were sent back to Israel. They later appeared on Israeli TV where they told the interviewer that they were there to document the event. That means they had foreknowledge of the attacks and considering the fact that the vans were full of explosives, they were obviously not just there to document, they were there to participate. I believe this is one of the biggest smoking guns of 9/11.\n\n*8) Cheney likely gave a direct order not to shoot down flight 77.\nHmmm... The question quoted says, \"When you had that order given, I think it was by the president, that authorized the shooting down of commercial aircraft that were suspected to be controlled by terrorists, were you there?\" If Cheney said, \"the orders still stand,\" doesn\u0027t that mean he is CONFIRMING the ability to shoot down commercial aircraft, per the president\u0027s authorization? Am I missing where it says that \"the orders\" are NOT to shoot?*\n\nIf the order was to shoot down the plane, then why was it not carried out? They had plenty of time, they knew exactly where the plane was and they had the assets to do it. But judging by the way the question was worded by the assistant, you have to assume that the order was NOT to shoot the plane down. This one is pretty much speculation so there is no way to prove anything one way or the other without an admission of guilt from someone.\n\n*9) Who really gained?\nI completely agree that the government exploited the events of 9/11 enormously, including to ends that had nothing to do with it, such as the invasion of Iraq. But exploiting events for your own agenda in no way proves that you staged them: it\u0027s just political business as usual. If, as many contend, 9/11 was staged to invade Iraq, why was it apparently carried out by 19 Saudis? It would make much more sense to have evidence pointing at Iraq.*\n\nWhy did we invade Afghanistan if the highjackers were all Saudi?\n\n*10) The bodies of Phillip Marshall, his two children, and the family dog were found on February 2, and officials quickly determined it was a murder-suicide. But the Washington, D.C.-based Wayne Madsen Report (WMR) has found evidence that contradicts the official finding.\nMarshall doesn\u0027t appear to have said anything particularly about 9/11 that many others haven\u0027t said. While the murder-suicide certainly appears suspicious, Marshall appears to have moved in a number of other circles, including drug-related ones, which might equally well have had an interest in silencing him.*\n\nWell atleast you aren\u0027t denying that he was murdered. Again, more speculation. We have no idea who murdered him but if it wasn\u0027t the Government and it was suspected that he was murdered, why would the cops call it a murder/suicide? Also, shortly after his death, FBI Agents showed up at his house and removed all of his computers and boxes of other evidence. Who gave them permission to do that? Why were they taken if it was in fact a murder/suicide? Case closed so there should be no reason to take his stuff. They obviously wanted whatever information he had.\n\n","duration":"","id":151,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_csbp9ci","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":128,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"skepticonspiracist1","label":"Alright, I\u0027ll take a stab. \n\n\u0026gt; 1) \"No clear explanation for the source of the sulfur has been identified.\"\n\nThe mission of the FEMA study was not to provide such a source.

Then he would recruit 19 Saudis who just happened to get their Visa Fast Tracked even though most of them should have not been allowed to fly to the US. The 19 Saudis would train at a variety of flight schools, including US military Bases without anyone catching on. (Except for all of the FBI Agents who reported it to the superiors only to be told to mind your own business.) Then on 9/11, they successfully highjack 4 airliners without incident. They swept into the cockpit so fast. Not a single pilot squawked the highjack code. And then 3 of the planes hit their targets and the 4th wouldn\u0027t have been stopped by the military either but luckily that plane was full of Patriots who took back the plane and crashed it into a field. (Wouldn\u0027t that make a great Die Hard Movie? McClain is on a plane that gets highjacked so he kills the terrorists, takes back the plane and crashes it into the side of a mountain killing everyone. The End.). With 2 of the planes, they leveled the entire World Trade Center Complex, mostly targeting Insurance Brokers and Auditors at both the WTC and the Pentagon.  And then for over 10 years, he managed to elude the most powerful nation on the planet while sending out videos and audio messages on CNN and suffering from complete kidney failure and a variety of other serious health issues. That is until we tortured the fuck out of some Muslim who gave up Bin Laden\u0027s hideout and then it was on like Donkey Kong. Seal Team 6 swooped down from Stealth Helicopters. Bin Laden saw them coming and threw one of his shoes into the Helicopters rotors, taking out one of the Helicopters. Seal Team 6 stormed the compound, killing everyone as they leveled up to Bin Laden\u0027s Level. They busted into his room where he was jacking off one last time to his American Porn Stash. They shot him 1500 times before he could bust a bit, which is a shame because they needed a DNA sample because no one is going to believe they really killed him. They took the body and flew it out to sea where he was buried according to Islamic Tradition because we\u0027re righteous crusaders. You may be our enemy but we still respect your religious ceremonies.

The question quoted says, \"When you had **that order** given, I think it was by the president, that **authorized the shooting down of commercial aircraft** that were suspected to be controlled by terrorists, were you there?\" If Cheney said, \"the orders still stand,\" doesn\u0027t that mean he is CONFIRMING the ability to shoot down commercial aircraft, per the president\u0027s authorization? Am I missing where it says that \"the orders\" are NOT to shoot?\n\n\u0026gt; 9) Who really gained?\n\nI completely agree that the government exploited the events of 9/11 enormously, including to ends that had nothing to do with it, such as the invasion of Iraq. But exploiting events for your own agenda in no way proves that you staged them: it\u0027s just political business as usual. If, as many contend, 9/11 was staged to invade Iraq, why was it apparently carried out by 19 Saudis? It would make much more sense to have evidence pointing at Iraq. \n\n\u0026gt; 10) The bodies of Phillip Marshall, his two children, and the family dog were found on February 2, and officials quickly determined it was a murder-suicide. But the Washington, D.C.-based Wayne Madsen Report (WMR) has found evidence that contradicts the official finding.\n\nMarshall doesn\u0027t appear to have said anything particularly about 9/11 that many others haven\u0027t said. While the murder-suicide certainly appears suspicious, Marshall appears to have [moved in a number of other circles](http://21stcenturywire.com/2013/02/28/philip-marshall-murder-suicide-a-lack-of-evidence/), including drug-related ones, which might equally well have had an interest in silencing him.

There was never anything to tie these people to 9/11 and initial reports of explosives were subsequently retracted as false.*\n\nIt wasn\u0027t the dancing that proved guilt so much as the arrest of these Israeli\u0027s on the George Washington Bridge in a van full of explosives. There were actually two vans, one of them had explosives and the other one was blown up by the occupants of the van as they were escaping. The Vans were from a company called Urban Moving Systems and they had a mural painted on the side showing the Twin Towers with a plane flying into them on fire. The Israeli\u0027s that were arrested were Mossad Agents and not only did the vans and all of the evidence disappear but the Israeli\u0027s were not charged and were sent back to Israel. They later appeared on Israeli TV where they told the interviewer that they were there to document the event. That means they had foreknowledge of the attacks and considering the fact that the vans were full of explosives, they were obviously not just there to document, they were there to participate. I believe this is one of the biggest smoking guns of 9/11.\n\n*8) Cheney likely gave a direct order not to shoot down flight 77.\nHmmm... The question quoted says, \"When you had that order given, I think it was by the president, that authorized the shooting down of commercial aircraft that were suspected to be controlled by terrorists, were you there?\" If Cheney said, \"the orders still stand,\" doesn\u0027t that mean he is CONFIRMING the ability to shoot down commercial aircraft, per the president\u0027s authorization? Am I missing where it says that \"the orders\" are NOT to shoot?*\n\nIf the order was to shoot down the plane, then why was it not carried out? They had plenty of time, they knew exactly where the plane was and they had the assets to do it. But judging by the way the question was worded by the assistant, you have to assume that the order was NOT to shoot the plane down. This one is pretty much speculation so there is no way to prove anything one way or the other without an admission of guilt from someone.\n\n*9) Who really gained?\nI completely agree that the government exploited the events of 9/11 enormously, including to ends that had nothing to do with it, such as the invasion of Iraq.

Again, more speculation. We have no idea who murdered him but if it wasn\u0027t the Government and it was suspected that he was murdered, why would the cops call it a murder/suicide? Also, shortly after his death, FBI Agents showed up at his house and removed all of his computers and boxes of other evidence. Who gave them permission to do that? Why were they taken if it was in fact a murder/suicide? Case closed so there should be no reason to take his stuff. They obviously wanted whatever information he had.\n\n","duration":"","id":151,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_csbp9ci","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":128,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"skepticonspiracist1","label":"Alright, I\u0027ll take a stab. \n\n\u0026gt; 1) \"No clear explanation for the source of the sulfur has been identified.\"\n\nThe mission of the FEMA study was not to provide such a source.

But exploiting events for your own agenda in no way proves that you staged them: it\u0027s just political business as usual.

Another red-flag: no-one else has been able to reproduce Harrit\u0027s findings, an essential requirement in science.*\n\nFirst of all, the NIST Report was not peer reviewed and they refuse to release the computer models used to arrive at their conclusion for the collapse of Building 7. They have no explanation for the free fall speed of the collapse and they have never been able to reproduce jet fuel melting steel beams in a lab. No one has and several independent tests have been conducted attempting to reproduce the effect to no avail.\n\nAnyone that has tried to dispute the Government Version of events is fired. Kevin Ryan at UL, Steven Jones\n\n*\u0026gt;5) He notes that, on one video, Bin Laden wears golden rings on his fingers, an adornment banned among Wahhabi followers.\nI\u0027m curious how he can tell metallic composition from a video. Also, note there are plenty of other pics showing OBL wearing a ring.*\n\nThere are dozens of reasons to believe that the Bin Laden Confession Video was fake.\n\nhttp://www.globalresearch.ca/did-osama-bin-laden-confess-to-the-9-11-attacks-and-did-he-die-in-2001/18923\n\n*6) Israeli intelligence were literally caught “dancing in celebration”.\nIf \"dancing\" proves guilt, then plenty of Arabs were also guilty that day. There was never anything to tie these people to 9/11 and initial reports of explosives were subsequently retracted as false.*\n\nIt wasn\u0027t the dancing that proved guilt so much as the arrest of these Israeli\u0027s on the George Washington Bridge in a van full of explosives. There were actually two vans, one of them had explosives and the other one was blown up by the occupants of the van as they were escaping. The Vans were from a company called Urban Moving Systems and they had a mural painted on the side showing the Twin Towers with a plane flying into them on fire. The Israeli\u0027s that were arrested were Mossad Agents and not only did the vans and all of the evidence disappear but the Israeli\u0027s were not charged and were sent back to Israel. They later appeared on Israeli TV where they told the interviewer that they were there to document the event. That means they had foreknowledge of the attacks and considering the fact that the vans were full of explosives, they were obviously not just there to document, they were there to participate. I believe this is one of the biggest smoking guns of 9/11.\n\n*8) Cheney likely gave a direct order not to shoot down flight 77.\nHmmm... The question quoted says, \"When you had that order given, I think it was by the president, that authorized the shooting down of commercial aircraft that were suspected to be controlled by terrorists, were you there?\" If Cheney said, \"the orders still stand,\" doesn\u0027t that mean he is CONFIRMING the ability to shoot down commercial aircraft, per the president\u0027s authorization? Am I missing where it says that \"the orders\" are NOT to shoot?*\n\nIf the order was to shoot down the plane, then why was it not carried out? They had plenty of time, they knew exactly where the plane was and they had the assets to do it. But judging by the way the question was worded by the assistant, you have to assume that the order was NOT to shoot the plane down. This one is pretty much speculation so there is no way to prove anything one way or the other without an admission of guilt from someone.\n\n*9) Who really gained?\nI completely agree that the government exploited the events of 9/11 enormously, including to ends that had nothing to do with it, such as the invasion of Iraq. But exploiting events for your own agenda in no way proves that you staged them: it\u0027s just political business as usual. If, as many contend, 9/11 was staged to invade Iraq, why was it apparently carried out by 19 Saudis? It would make much more sense to have evidence pointing at Iraq.*\n\nWhy did we invade Afghanistan if the highjackers were all Saudi?\n\n*10) The bodies of Phillip Marshall, his two children, and the family dog were found on February 2, and officials quickly determined it was a murder-suicide. But the Washington, D.C.-based Wayne Madsen Report (WMR) has found evidence that contradicts the official finding.\nMarshall doesn\u0027t appear to have said anything particularly about 9/11 that many others haven\u0027t said.

Again, more speculation. We have no idea who murdered him but if it wasn\u0027t the Government and it was suspected that he was murdered, why would the cops call it a murder/suicide? Also, shortly after his death, FBI Agents showed up at his house and removed all of his computers and boxes of other evidence. Who gave them permission to do that? Why were they taken if it was in fact a murder/suicide? Case closed so there should be no reason to take his stuff. They obviously wanted whatever information he had.\n\n","duration":"","id":151,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_csbp9ci","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":128,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"skepticonspiracist1","label":"Alright, I\u0027ll take a stab. \n\n\u0026gt; 1) \"No clear explanation for the source of the sulfur has been identified.\"\n\nThe mission of the FEMA study was not to provide such a source.

However, since then there have studies which have [looked into this](http://www.911myths.com/Sulfur.pdf), and come up with a number of possible sources, including the burning diesel oil in WTC7, or gypsum-based wallboard, heavily used in the main towers, which is close to 20% sulfur by weight. The analysis certainly does NOT \"proves that it was attacked by some form of munition.\"\n\n\u0026gt; 2) The hijackers’ VISA applications.\n\nHanlon\u0027s Razor: \"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.\" For this to be any kind of evidence, you would need to show all other applications were processed correctly, and that similarly defective application submitted at the same time were rejected. \n\n\u0026gt; 3) \"Niaz Naik, a former Pakistani Foreign Secretary, was told by senior American officials in mid-July that military action against Afghanistan would go ahead by the middle of October.\"\n\nI recommend Damian Cave\u0027s [detailed investigation](http://www.salon.com/2002/08/16/forbidden_truth/) into this claim, which found plausible, if unproven, grounds for doubting Naik\u0027s recollection. \n\n\u0026gt; 4) Professor Niels Harrit published a peer-reviewed paper in 2009 proving the existence of high-energy thermite residue in four out of four WTC samples.\n\nThe \"peer-reviewed\" *Open Chemical Physics Journal* has a pretty dubious reputation. It\u0027s part of Bentham Science Publishers, which was one of the targets of the [Who\u0027s Afraid of Peer Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who%27s_Afraid_of_Peer_Review%3F) sting, in which papers which were literal nonsense got accepted. Another red-flag: no-one else has been able to reproduce Harrit\u0027s findings, an essential requirement in science. \n\n\u0026gt; 5) He notes that, on one video, Bin Laden wears golden rings on his fingers, an adornment banned among Wahhabi followers.\n\nI\u0027m curious how he can tell metallic composition from a video.

There was never anything to tie these people to 9/11 and initial reports of explosives were [subsequently retracted as false](http://web.archive.org/web/20100224011350/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2001/09/15/2001-09-15_blunders_mar_scoops_in_the_r.html).\n\n\u0026gt; 7) British university study confirms that 9/11 \"Conspiracy Theorists\" are the sane ones.\n\nTIL that frequency of posting on internet forums \u003d a measure of sanity. And, moving RAPIDLY on...\n\n\u0026gt; 8) Cheney likely gave a direct order not to shoot down flight 77.\n\nHmmm... The question quoted says, \"When you had **that order** given, I think it was by the president, that **authorized the shooting down of commercial aircraft** that were suspected to be controlled by terrorists, were you there?\" If Cheney said, \"the orders still stand,\" doesn\u0027t that mean he is CONFIRMING the ability to shoot down commercial aircraft, per the president\u0027s authorization? Am I missing where it says that \"the orders\" are NOT to shoot?\n\n\u0026gt; 9) Who really gained?\n\nI completely agree that the government exploited the events of 9/11 enormously, including to ends that had nothing to do with it, such as the invasion of Iraq. But exploiting events for your own agenda in no way proves that you staged them: it\u0027s just political business as usual. If, as many contend, 9/11 was staged to invade Iraq, why was it apparently carried out by 19 Saudis? It would make much more sense to have evidence pointing at Iraq. \n\n\u0026gt; 10) The bodies of Phillip Marshall, his two children, and the family dog were found on February 2, and officials quickly determined it was a murder-suicide.

I\u0027m also quite convinced myself about the 9/11 being an inside thing, and maybe even the start of the collapse was done using explosives/thermite/etc, but those 2 points that you linked are quite wrong imho.\n\n\n**The physics part**\n\nThere is one thing in physics called *pressure*. It\u0027s by definition force by unit of surface (more force and less surface make a lot of pressure). Now, keep in mind that most, if not all, the explosions you see are in the lower parts of the tower, just below the falling part. And that makes a lot of sense:\n\nThe building falling weights **a lot** (a lot of force), and is pressing the lower part making each floor collapse (very small surface in comparison with the force). Everything inside that floor (air, walls, furniture, people, and even debris) just gained a lot of pressure there and the most fragile part of the floor are the lateral walls (they are not designed to hold almost any force at all, while the floor and the ceiling are really a lot stronger). That means that all that pressure can only go to the sides exploding like a can with too much pressure inside.\n\nAlso, as other experts say you have the \"spring effect\" that pushes stuff to the sides. That\u0027s quite normal, specially in a building made of steel. Nothing falls straight down if there is other stuff below, it just collapses floor by floor, and each floor is different, the forces are different and not all the floor collapses at the exactly same time making that some debris goes to one direction and other goes to other direction.\n\nKeep in mind that this horizontal forces never break any physics rule at all. And remember that a building collapsing is not a solid rigid (something that all those equations you study in physics assume).\n\nAlso, a building is not a free falling object so you can\u0027t compare the timing with a ball falling from a building. It\u0027s not a rigid body, and it\u0027s not \"falling\", it\u0027s *collapsing*, an extremely different term and very difficult to study and predict because there are lot\u0027s of different variables unknown in play.\n\nIs it normal for big building parts to fall far to the sides? Yes. Obviously. Just play jenga and you\u0027ll see if part\u0027s can fall to the sides even if the only apparent force is gravity.\nIt\u0027s an effect of something called [moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_%28physics%29). Things tend to turn if they are not stable, and that can make something fall to the sides, and if that collapses with something lower it can send it to the side even further.\n\n\n**Jet-fuel can\u0027t melt steel**\n\nAnd neither needs to. Steel loses lot\u0027s of it\u0027s load capacity with high temperature and time ([creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creep_%28deformation%29), physical deformations, changes in the weights supported). Also the buildings were quite old and lot has changed in the fire regulations since. I\u0027m not sure about it but afaik the building used only steel beams as support, and steel behavior is really bad with high temperatures (doesn\u0027t need to be even near the melting point) in comparison with other elements such as reinforced concrete. Do you know what a forge is? Do they melt the steel? No right? It\u0027s not even near melting point in fact, and just a man with a hammer can bend the steel.\n\nNow imagine an extremely big building with some structural damage (did some beams got cut because of the plane crashing? If they did the force that those beams were doing to support the building is now in the beams that are still intact). Add that extra weight that the beams have to support to the much higher temperatures and give it some time... boom they loose most of it\u0027s strength and just bend. One bends, the building doesn\u0027t fall but the tension the other beams has to support increases, boom, another beam less... and suddenly all the floor collapses.\n\n\nI\u0027m not saying it might be not a thermite ignition at first, but once one of the floors collapsed, the building was already condemned. Floors are not designed to support half building falling on top of them (percussion).\n\n\nI feel I\u0027m going to get downvoted to hell, but this is what I can tell you from what I have studied in these last 7 years at college.

Those two I pointed for example seem to me something that someone that hasn\u0027t studied structural analysis would say.\n\nWhy do I think it\u0027s an inside job? First I have to warn you that I\u0027m not from the USA, and I really don\u0027t like at all their government so my view could be quite biased.\n\n**First point**: It\u0027s not the first time that the USA attacks himself to start a war because of interests. Here the war with Spain comes to my mind, remember? The [USS Maine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Maine_%28ACR-1%29): http://www.falseflag.info/uss-maine/\n\nThere are also other similar cases: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods This one didn\u0027t happen in the end but was planned. Who know what they have done before and after for their interests?\n\n\n**Second point**: It\u0027s usually said \"look for the first beneficiary and you\u0027ll have your first suspect\". As most have pointed out, the USA government, specially Bush and his friends, big corporations (weapons-making, war mercenaries, oil multinationals, ...), and Israel, big friend of the USA, had a lot of interest in that war as pointed out in this thread.\n\n**Third point**: The buildings collapse almost vertically. If a plane hits a side I expect the beams in that side to suffer more than the ones on the other side. And that means that the buildings should have bent to the side the plane crashed before falling to the ground. To me it seems that at least the first (and maybe the rest) of the floors were detonated to avoid destroying half of the city. Now someone will say \"but you saaid\". I know what I said. I never said it wasn\u0027t detonations, I said that those stated points were not true. Those explosions could have been produced by the building falling naturally. And beams could have lost their structural power without the need of explosives. What I want to point out is that even if the towers could have fell by themselves I think that they were detonated so that they don\u0027t kill even more people.\nThat way is a tragedy big enough to start a war, but you don\u0027t have to rebuild all the city.\n\n\n**Forth point**: There are lots of points in the official version that don\u0027t stand up. The visa, the training of the terrorists, the videos, them not knowing... stuff like that. Just read the rest of the comments and see for yourself.\n\nWar creates **a lot** of money for the usa. And they have one of the governments I trust the less of all the world, they do what it\u0027s good for their private economic interests only, even if that means killing, starting wars, or controlling the population. Remember that it is by far the government that expends more money to the military, and not just that, it\u0027s the country with more private military companies in the world. No war \u003d no money, and there are a lot of big people there wanting that money and they don\u0027t care about a few deaths.\n\n\nSo, I might not have specific evidences about 9/11, but those points I stated are enough to make me know that something is wrong. I don\u0027t discard things like the planes being a decoy to detonate inside bombs, but they might have also been real planes too. Physically both options are plausible.\n\nThat\u0027s just my opinion tho.\n\nEdit: some misspells and such.\nEdit2: I\u0027m starting to change my mind in some of those points following this https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3a67mc/10_reasons_why_911_was_demonstrably_an_inside_job/cs9zjzr","duration":"","id":261,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cscfevn","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":260,"links":[259],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"gologologolo","label":"When the evidence refutes it, what evidence convinces you, especially as an engineer, that it was an inside job?","duration":"","id":260,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_cscbkif","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":259,"links":[238],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"ecchiojisan","label":"Engineer here.

It\u0027s by definition force by unit of surface (more force and less surface make a lot of pressure). Now, keep in mind that most, if not all, the explosions you see are in the lower parts of the tower, just below the falling part. And that makes a lot of sense:\n\nThe building falling weights **a lot** (a lot of force), and is pressing the lower part making each floor collapse (very small surface in comparison with the force). Everything inside that floor (air, walls, furniture, people, and even debris) just gained a lot of pressure there and the most fragile part of the floor are the lateral walls (they are not designed to hold almost any force at all, while the floor and the ceiling are really a lot stronger). That means that all that pressure can only go to the sides exploding like a can with too much pressure inside.\n\nAlso, as other experts say you have the \"spring effect\" that pushes stuff to the sides. That\u0027s quite normal, specially in a building made of steel. Nothing falls straight down if there is other stuff below, it just collapses floor by floor, and each floor is different, the forces are different and not all the floor collapses at the exactly same time making that some debris goes to one direction and other goes to other direction.\n\nKeep in mind that this horizontal forces never break any physics rule at all. And remember that a building collapsing is not a solid rigid (something that all those equations you study in physics assume).\n\nAlso, a building is not a free falling object so you can\u0027t compare the timing with a ball falling from a building. It\u0027s not a rigid body, and it\u0027s not \"falling\", it\u0027s *collapsing*, an extremely different term and very difficult to study and predict because there are lot\u0027s of different variables unknown in play.\n\nIs it normal for big building parts to fall far to the sides? Yes. Obviously. Just play jenga and you\u0027ll see if part\u0027s can fall to the sides even if the only apparent force is gravity.\nIt\u0027s an effect of something called [moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_%28physics%29). Things tend to turn if they are not stable, and that can make something fall to the sides, and if that collapses with something lower it can send it to the side even further.\n\n\n**Jet-fuel can\u0027t melt steel**\n\nAnd neither needs to. Steel loses lot\u0027s of it\u0027s load capacity with high temperature and time ([creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creep_%28deformation%29), physical deformations, changes in the weights supported). Also the buildings were quite old and lot has changed in the fire regulations since. I\u0027m not sure about it but afaik the building used only steel beams as support, and steel behavior is really bad with high temperatures (doesn\u0027t need to be even near the melting point) in comparison with other elements such as reinforced concrete. Do you know what a forge is? Do they melt the steel? No right? It\u0027s not even near melting point in fact, and just a man with a hammer can bend the steel.\n\nNow imagine an extremely big building with some structural damage (did some beams got cut because of the plane crashing? If they did the force that those beams were doing to support the building is now in the beams that are still intact). Add that extra weight that the beams have to support to the much higher temperatures and give it some time... boom they loose most of it\u0027s strength and just bend.

It\u0027s by definition force by unit of surface (more force and less surface make a lot of pressure). Now, keep in mind that most, if not all, the explosions you see are in the lower parts of the tower, just below the falling part. And that makes a lot of sense:\n\nThe building falling weights **a lot** (a lot of force), and is pressing the lower part making each floor collapse (very small surface in comparison with the force). Everything inside that floor (air, walls, furniture, people, and even debris) just gained a lot of pressure there and the most fragile part of the floor are the lateral walls (they are not designed to hold almost any force at all, while the floor and the ceiling are really a lot stronger). That means that all that pressure can only go to the sides exploding like a can with too much pressure inside.\n\nAlso, as other experts say you have the \"spring effect\" that pushes stuff to the sides. That\u0027s quite normal, specially in a building made of steel. Nothing falls straight down if there is other stuff below, it just collapses floor by floor, and each floor is different, the forces are different and not all the floor collapses at the exactly same time making that some debris goes to one direction and other goes to other direction.\n\nKeep in mind that this horizontal forces never break any physics rule at all. And remember that a building collapsing is not a solid rigid (something that all those equations you study in physics assume).\n\nAlso, a building is not a free falling object so you can\u0027t compare the timing with a ball falling from a building. It\u0027s not a rigid body, and it\u0027s not \"falling\", it\u0027s *collapsing*, an extremely different term and very difficult to study and predict because there are lot\u0027s of different variables unknown in play.\n\nIs it normal for big building parts to fall far to the sides? Yes. Obviously. Just play jenga and you\u0027ll see if part\u0027s can fall to the sides even if the only apparent force is gravity.\nIt\u0027s an effect of something called [moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_%28physics%29). Things tend to turn if they are not stable, and that can make something fall to the sides, and if that collapses with something lower it can send it to the side even further.\n\n\n**Jet-fuel can\u0027t melt steel**\n\nAnd neither needs to. Steel loses lot\u0027s of it\u0027s load capacity with high temperature and time ([creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creep_%28deformation%29), physical deformations, changes in the weights supported). Also the buildings were quite old and lot has changed in the fire regulations since. I\u0027m not sure about it but afaik the building used only steel beams as support, and steel behavior is really bad with high temperatures (doesn\u0027t need to be even near the melting point) in comparison with other elements such as reinforced concrete. Do you know what a forge is? Do they melt the steel? No right? It\u0027s not even near melting point in fact, and just a man with a hammer can bend the steel.\n\nNow imagine an extremely big building with some structural damage (did some beams got cut because of the plane crashing? If they did the force that those beams were doing to support the building is now in the beams that are still intact). Add that extra weight that the beams have to support to the much higher temperatures and give it some time... boom they loose most of it\u0027s strength and just bend. One bends, the building doesn\u0027t fall but the tension the other beams has to support increases, boom, another beam less... and suddenly all the floor collapses.\n\n\nI\u0027m not saying it might be not a thermite ignition at first, but once one of the floors collapsed, the building was already condemned. Floors are not designed to support half building falling on top of them (percussion).\n\n\nI feel I\u0027m going to get downvoted to hell, but this is what I can tell you from what I have studied in these last 7 years at college.

Please explain yourself. What do you mean by 93x1 floors and 1x93 floors?\n\nAnd are you talking about the first floor to fail or the following ones?\n\nIf you mean the first one: I didn\u0027t say the weight changed at all. I said the structure changed because of the heat and possibly by the crash and explosion itself. If a few beams stop working because they lost their properties because of the heat then the rest of the beams have to support what they were designed for + the weight of the ones that stopped working. Is that clear? If you have, let\u0027s say, 4 steel beams supporting the building and one stops being able to support anything, the rest 3 have to support more. Keep removing beams and at one point the rest of the beams fail and the floor collapses.\n\n\nIf you were talking about the rest of the floors that were collapsing later, it doesn\u0027t matter at all that those beams are in perfect shape because they no longer have to support the weight of the building. They have to support the weight + the impact generated from the upper floor collapsing. That impact is more than enough to destroy the floor.\n\nSee it this way: imagine I have a bowling ball and a wooden table. I put the bowling ball on top and the table doesn\u0027t have any problem supporting it. Now imagine I let the bowling ball fall from a height of say, 5m or so. The ball hits the table and it breaks. Ow! But it was able to support the ball just before! And the ball doesn\u0027t weight more! But it broke nonetheless. Is it clearer now?\n\nI\u0027m just trying to point flaws in some of the points made here. I thought we were all open minded in this subreddit. ;) As I said I do believe in lot\u0027s of the things said here, but there are some other things that are just impossible and I think it\u0027s a good thing to point out them out and try to figure out what really happened, right?","duration":"","id":264,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cscebmh","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":263,"links":[259],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Quantumhead","label":"\u0026gt; The building falling weights a lot (a lot of force), and is pressing the lower part making each floor collapse (very small surface in comparison with the force)\n\nYou\u0027re not an engineer.

It\u0027s by definition force by unit of surface (more force and less surface make a lot of pressure). Now, keep in mind that most, if not all, the explosions you see are in the lower parts of the tower, just below the falling part. And that makes a lot of sense:\n\nThe building falling weights **a lot** (a lot of force), and is pressing the lower part making each floor collapse (very small surface in comparison with the force). Everything inside that floor (air, walls, furniture, people, and even debris) just gained a lot of pressure there and the most fragile part of the floor are the lateral walls (they are not designed to hold almost any force at all, while the floor and the ceiling are really a lot stronger). That means that all that pressure can only go to the sides exploding like a can with too much pressure inside.\n\nAlso, as other experts say you have the \"spring effect\" that pushes stuff to the sides. That\u0027s quite normal, specially in a building made of steel. Nothing falls straight down if there is other stuff below, it just collapses floor by floor, and each floor is different, the forces are different and not all the floor collapses at the exactly same time making that some debris goes to one direction and other goes to other direction.\n\nKeep in mind that this horizontal forces never break any physics rule at all. And remember that a building collapsing is not a solid rigid (something that all those equations you study in physics assume).\n\nAlso, a building is not a free falling object so you can\u0027t compare the timing with a ball falling from a building. It\u0027s not a rigid body, and it\u0027s not \"falling\", it\u0027s *collapsing*, an extremely different term and very difficult to study and predict because there are lot\u0027s of different variables unknown in play.\n\nIs it normal for big building parts to fall far to the sides? Yes. Obviously. Just play jenga and you\u0027ll see if part\u0027s can fall to the sides even if the only apparent force is gravity.\nIt\u0027s an effect of something called [moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_%28physics%29).

Steel loses lot\u0027s of it\u0027s load capacity with high temperature and time ([creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creep_%28deformation%29), physical deformations, changes in the weights supported). Also the buildings were quite old and lot has changed in the fire regulations since. I\u0027m not sure about it but afaik the building used only steel beams as support, and steel behavior is really bad with high temperatures (doesn\u0027t need to be even near the melting point) in comparison with other elements such as reinforced concrete. Do you know what a forge is? Do they melt the steel? No right? It\u0027s not even near melting point in fact, and just a man with a hammer can bend the steel.\n\nNow imagine an extremely big building with some structural damage (did some beams got cut because of the plane crashing? If they did the force that those beams were doing to support the building is now in the beams that are still intact). Add that extra weight that the beams have to support to the much higher temperatures and give it some time... boom they loose most of it\u0027s strength and just bend. One bends, the building doesn\u0027t fall but the tension the other beams has to support increases, boom, another beam less... and suddenly all the floor collapses.\n\n\nI\u0027m not saying it might be not a thermite ignition at first, but once one of the floors collapsed, the building was already condemned. Floors are not designed to support half building falling on top of them (percussion).\n\n\nI feel I\u0027m going to get downvoted to hell, but this is what I can tell you from what I have studied in these last 7 years at college.

Now the building is falling, say 5m at 9.81m/s² and then suddenly stops because it hits the lower floor. The top building was falling (velocity \u0026gt; 0), and now is stop because it hit the lower floor, so there is an acceleration (derivative of velocity over time is acceleration), so there is a force. Who eats that force? The lower floor. Are there more forces in play? Yes, the weight. So we have that the lower floor has to support weight + impact force, that\u0027s why I said that it weighed more, but anyway, I shouldn\u0027t have said it that way.

Like you, I didn\u0027t care about much and I guess I always just assumed our leaders were good people who would never be involved in something like that.\n\nThe turnaround for me happened around 2005, when one of my friends turned up with a copy of Loose Change. He was grinning like a madman, and kept telling me it was an inside job. I have to tell you that at the time I thought he\u0027d gone bonkers.\n\nAfter seeing the video I remember thinking that if even ten percent of it was legitimate, then there was some kind of cover up going on. I still wasn\u0027t entirely convinced though. Then I watched Zeitgeist and it was at that point I decided to start researching it myself.\n\nWhat really swayed me is that I was learning classical mechanics at the time, and it really helped me understand why the official explanation of the WTC collapses isn\u0027t physically possible. \n\nFrom then on it\u0027s been like unravelling a ball of string. Over the last five or so years I\u0027ve really learned the extent to which the public\u0027s information is manipulated, and I\u0027ve learned just how truly evil and insane the people who are doing it are.","duration":"","id":298,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_csaywoa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":297,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"platinum_peter","label":"Great thread, OP, great thread.\n\nThank you.

How do you pull off what would be an enormous operation without someone at least saying hang on this isn\u0027t right?\n\nDo you mean ethically? Well, Zionists don\u0027t really have a code of ethics where non-Zionists are concerned. You can consider Zionism to be an ideology similar to Nazism in that Zionists see themselves as racially (and intellectually) superior to everyone else.\n\nAside from pretty much all the documented and circumstantial evidence pointing to Zionists, false flag attacks are an Israeli speciality. They\u0027ve done it before, on numerous occasions.\n\nSheer common sense stipulates that it is not a coincidence NORAD couldn\u0027t respond on that particular morning because it was busy conducting simulated hijacking exercises. That\u0027s on top of the named hijackers all having handed in \"incomprehensible\" VISA applications.\n\nBasically, it couldn\u0027t be more obvious. That\u0027s why it\u0027s both amazing and horrifying that they\u0027ve gotten away with it. Their story is ludicrous. They\u0027ve gotten away with it purely because of their control over our society and its information.\n\n\u0026gt; I mean take to rig the buildings with explosives is I imagine a pretty big job and how do you convince people to fly planes to their death.\n\nIt undoubtedly was a big job, but that\u0027s no reason to assume it didn\u0027t happen. I don\u0027t know the exact details of how it was achieved any more than you do. The only way I could know that is if I actually did it.\n\nAs regards how you could convince someone to fly a plane into a building, then that\u0027s fairly simple.

Wood and Karen M. Douglas of the University of Kent (UK). Entitled “What about Building 7? A social psychological study of online discussion of 9/11 conspiracy theories,” the study compared “conspiracist” (pro-conspiracy theory) and “conventionalist” (anti-conspiracy) comments at news websites.**\n\n**The authors were surprised to discover that it is now more conventional to leave so-called conspiracist comments than conventionalist ones: “Of the 2174 comments collected, 1459 were coded as conspiracist and 715 as conventionalist.” In other words, among people who comment on news articles, those who disbelieve government accounts of such events as 9/11 and the JFK assassination outnumber believers by more than two to one. That means it is the pro-conspiracy commenters who are expressing what is now the conventional wisdom, while the anti-conspiracy commenters are becoming a small, beleaguered minority.**\n\nhttp://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/07/12/313399/conspiracy-theorists-v%20s-govt-dupes\n\n8) Cheney likely gave a direct order not to shoot down flight 77.\n\nThe testimony of Norman Mineta before the 9/11 commission seems to suggest Cheney was kept aware of the path of flight 77 as it approached the Pentagon, and that he repeated an order not to shoot it down.\n\n**MR.

But the Washington, D.C.-based Wayne Madsen Report (WMR) has found evidence that contradicts the official finding.
