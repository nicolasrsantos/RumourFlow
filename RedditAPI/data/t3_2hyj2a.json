Both of the 2 dominant parties have done this during their times in ascendancy. This has been done for several reasons.\n\n1) Congress can now go to their most loyal constituents and spin a thread of their work in the legislative branch without actually having a concrete trail of evidence as to how they voted. This is the cowards way of presenting themselves - allowing for maximum spin to fit the narrative of those who vote for them. This becomes ever more prevalent as the districts become ever more Gerrymandered.\n\nThus the Executive Office can become a scapegoat for the Legislative Branch. Since they no longer are able to pass laws - this gives both major parties a chance to beat their drum. If their party is in office and their constituents line up behind that person - then they point to the Executive Actions and the ineptness of the Congress. If they are out of power or the Executive is out of favor - then they can just as easily point to \"Presidential Overreach\", \"Harming the dignity of the Congress\", \"or call for impeachment\".\n\n2) Americans like and are drawn to \"exceptional\" personalities. They cheer on the Quarterback who leads the team - rarely do they cheer the Left Tackle or Guard, when they do it is part of the Offensive Line that works together as a team. The Kobes, LeBrons, Jordons snag the spotlight while the team around them that enables them to succeed does not see as much gilt. It is a strong desire to embody into one person the success of those around them.\n\nThe office of the President does represent that one pinnacle person. The \"Leader of the Free World\", the \"Commander-in-Chief\" of the most powerful and capable military in the world. Our terminology embodies within a single person the pulse of the world - even though the executive branch is comprised of thousands of people.\n\nIf the Secretary of State screws up we blame the President - if a Senator\u0027s AA screws up we blame the AA. Both are hired positions with the SoS enjoying far more independent power, but their actions are seen as Presidential actions.\n\nIn conclusion, it is far easier for a varied group of people to focus on a massive branch of the Federal government that is embodied by a single person rather than a massive branch of the Federal government embodied by many.","duration":"","id":65,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_ckxd8by","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":56,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"allegoryofthedave","label":" The thing is a lot of people from the US on reddit seem really intelligent but i find it strange that the idea that there is a single man calling all the shots from a office somewhere in some magic white castle is still so popular.
