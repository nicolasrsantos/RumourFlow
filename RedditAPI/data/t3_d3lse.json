At first I thought stuffblackpeopledontlike was a parody of stuffwhitepeoplelike and was getting set and ready for the awesome.  It wasn\u0027t awesome.  Nonplussed I carried onto thebirdman and was surprised to see that there was a man with a bird on his shoulder.  I thought OK NOW the awesome is going to begin.  There\u0027s this dude with a brown fucking HAWK on his head and he\u0027s got this cool I don\u0027t give a fuck look on his face.  \n\nGREAT!  So I started reading his site with like a bowl of popcorn and shit ready for the knowledge to drop.  Well that epic [hawkman ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dWniNwhV09R0)I had in my head started turning into a whiny bitch and so I had to look at his picture again (Like he\u0027d [***black***out](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dWniNwhV09R0#t\u003d45s)! get it? lol).  Who\u0027s this bitch whining and shit? Imagine my surprise when I saw he has a fucking pigeon on his head.  It could be a dove but hawks eat do who is this guy again? Right the birdman.  So I check on his site and determine it IS a [pigeon](http://www.thebirdman.org/Index/Index-SPBird.html).  OK OK.  So this guy is kinda epic because he like shits pigeons like everywhere as you\u0027ll see in the above link.  \n\nHe is totally like fucking up everybody that is trying to use the man against him.  Like you can use the man against The Man. The BirdMan. \n\nBut the birdman don\u0027t fuck around you see.  He likes to cold cock a nigga with [pre-emptive](http://www.thebirdman.org/Index/SPBird/SPBird-2NhbdFlyers.html) strikes and shit.  Which is a strike you do BEFORE something is empty.  Dude is fucking genius.  Those other sites were a bust but I\u0027m soooooo fucking glad you turned me onto TheBirdMan.  Motherfucker even has a [cowl](http://imgur.com/bOGBf). Now I want a motherfucking cowl!  Fuck I got a popcorn kernel stuck in my teeth.  \n\nAnyway his cowl is so clean you *know* he\u0027s got the answer for how to remove pigeon shit from your clothing.  He should post the technique and ask for paypal donations and shit.\n\nThanks again for the birdman link.
