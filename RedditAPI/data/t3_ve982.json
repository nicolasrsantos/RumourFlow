Most of this goes to the defense budget regardless of party. Small differences in allocation here. Republicans advocate tax breaks for the rich, and Obama extended these.\n\nRegulartory policy : Since when has anything been regulated by anyone? Policy and practice are different things.

Republicans - Tax the middle-class (most people) heavily. In practice I\u0027ll mention again that Obama extended tax cuts for the rich. Absolutely no difference.\n\nWhat facts do you have that let you make such bold claims? These two parties are quite similar in almost every regard. You\u0027ve basically boiled this election down to immigration policy.

Their base does this with *many* key issues.

Also, if you break up the electoral college suddenly the majority of votes trend reasonable.  Same deal if you got everyone over 18 to vote and look at what the majority supports...\n\nAs it stands though the big pool of tragically under informed voters is super important because their rural votes are worth more than urban votes, and the reasonable middle isn\u0027t voting so their votes get proportionally more important.  End result being that they get taken seriously, they get pandered to constantly, and there is a lot of profit in misinforming them (Fox).  \n\nThis on top of an outdated electoral college practically designed to make the country trend rural (and accordant social conservatism bred of unfamiliarity with different lifestyles), and an entrenched anti-democratic two party system with an anti-preference voting system.  The attack ads, server PACs, and Citizens United being shit-icing and crap-filling  on that turd cake.\n\nBasically, from my reading of the stats, if the dummies were treated and granted voted rights as befitting their representation in society I think we\u0027d be fine because they\u0027d be drowned out.  Put them in an echo chamber and increase their individual voting worth, OTOH, and we have trouble.\n\nElection reform, it\u0027s a BFD.","duration":"","id":71,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_c53ydqr","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":70,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"gloomdoom","label":"The is *the best* way of describing the current insanity mode of the right that involves no respect for logic, reason or truth.\n\nSeparate those things from the story and you end up with a bunch of people who are so poorly informed that they would (and indeed, have) shoot themselves in the feet.\n\nThe *problem* is that they\u0027re still too ignorant and prideful to just admit how fucking wrong they are based on the cold, hard facts. Their base does this with *many* key issues.

You hear that analogy with both parties but I challenge anyone to find a similar situation with liberals when it applies to facts and truth and blatant denial of both.\n\nDemocrats are impotent and spineless but they\u0027re not dangerous about it.
