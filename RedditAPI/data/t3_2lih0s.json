His grandfather converted from Catholicism to Islam, but his parents weren\u0027t religious (sourced from Wikipedia). Being a Christian seems to be a requirement for being elected to the presidency (we\u0027ve never had a non-Christian president), so basically everyone who wants to run has to play up their Christian heritage even if they don\u0027t practice regularly. \n\nClaiming he\u0027s a Muslim is just stupid xenophobia, preying on the kind of people who a) think that America is a Christian nation and that means everyone in government must be Christian, and b) are scared of Islamic-sounding names. Even if he was a Muslim, so fucking what? We\u0027re not at war with Islam, we\u0027re at war with terrorists who are using Islam to justify their murders, and that distinction is important; there are plenty of peaceful Muslims who are proud Americans out there. Part of separation of church and state is that you can\u0027t require an elected official be of a certain religion. \n\nIt\u0027s easier than attacking his policies, even though that would be a far better method of criticism. The problem is, the policies of his that are most harmful are ones that a Republican president would be just as likely to use as well (e.g. indefinite detention, prosecuting whistleblowers, extrajudicial drone assassinations, etc.) so they aren\u0027t good grounds for conservatives to attack him on. There are still others, you could attack Obamacare, immigration reform, foreign policy, if you disagree with how he handled those things, but it\u0027s not as sensational and attention-grabbing as saying \"OBAMA IS A MUSLIM LOOK HIS MIDDLE NAME IS HUSSEIN\".","duration":"","id":3,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_clv2zxq","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Is Obama really a Muslim?","label":"swimshoe","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_2lih0s","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.41533713E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.415337848E9,"simScore":0.4878048780487805,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":4,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"dtwhitecp","label":"a) no  \nb) it wouldn\u0027t matter if he was","duration":"","id":4,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_clv6oqk","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Is Obama really a Muslim?","label":"swimshoe","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_2lih0s","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.41533713E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.415344319E9,"simScore":0.8357333262761434,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":5,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"genie_gm","label":"[John Green answers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003d1jQ67cdzDyI)","duration":"","id":5,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_clv6p6n","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Is Obama really a Muslim?","label":"swimshoe","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_2lih0s","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.41533713E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.415344343E9,"simScore":0.8239999860525131,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},{"index":6,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"ml_watson","label":"It seems your question has been answered (to pile on, he\u0027s not and it wouldn\u0027t matter if he was).\n\n My semi-related rant, my favorite part of this whole attack is that the same people who say he\u0027s a Muslim and there\u0027s something wrong with that also attacked him for not disavowing a preacher at a church he had attended for years in Chicago who was on tape saying some pretty incendiary stuff.
