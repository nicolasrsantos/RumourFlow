Well, to editorialize for a moment, I would consider it as possibly the biggest piece of bullshit foreign policy philosophy that has ever graced the nation.\n\nHere is a description of it from a 2006 article:\n\n\u0026gt;In his heralded new book, \"The One Percent Doctrine,\" Ron Suskind writes that Vice President Dick Cheney forcefully stated that the war on terror empowered the Bush administration to act without the need for evidence or extensive analysis.\n\n\u0026gt;Suskind describes the Cheney doctrine as follows: \"Even if there\u0027s just a 1 percent chance of the unimaginable coming due, act as if it is a certainty. It\u0027s not about \u0027our analysis,\u0027 as Cheney said. It\u0027s about \u0027our response.\u0027 … Justified or not, fact-based or not, \u0027our response\u0027 is what matters. As to \u0027evidence,\u0027 the bar was set so low that the word itself almost didn\u0027t apply.\"\n\n\u0026gt;There is a complex interplay between an act\u0027s possible consequences, evidence, and the probabilities involved. And sometimes, of course, the probability justifying action of some sort is even less than 1 percent. Vaccines are routinely given, for example, even for diseases whose risk of being contracted is much less than 1 percent.\n\n\u0026gt;That being granted, the simplistic doctrine of \"if at least 1 percent, then act\" is especially frightening in international conflicts, not least because the number of threats misconstrued (by someone or other) to meet the 1 percent threshold is huge and the consequences of military action are so terrible and irrevocable.\n\nAnd so you see, with the 1 percent doctrine Cheney has created his defense for how they operated.  Moreover, with this doctrine he has created the response to allegations that he lied.  To you it\u0027s a \"lie\" but to him it was being cautious.  And so he would say something like this: \"no, I didn\u0027t lie, it\u0027s just that you people have the luxury of sitting at home and critiquing what we\u0027re doing while we actually have to make difficult decisions about protecting the American people or risk an extraordinarily deadly attack.  And we have to act with imperfect information.  And so it\u0027s not a lie if we decide that we can\u0027t risk the even 1% possibility that Saddam Hussein has WMD.\"\n\nI am not agreeing with Cheney\u0027s logic for how he proceeded.  However, in order for us as a society to move forward on this we do need to stop this stupid back and forth of \"you\u0027re a liar and a war criminal, no I\u0027m not, yes you are, no I\u0027m not.\"  And so if we are to have a serious discussion on all of this I think a good place to start is with a substantive discussion of Cheney\u0027s 1% doctrine.

Well, to editorialize for a moment, I would consider it as possibly the biggest piece of bullshit foreign policy philosophy that has ever graced the nation.\n\nHere is a description of it from a 2006 article:\n\n\u0026gt;In his heralded new book, \"The One Percent Doctrine,\" Ron Suskind writes that Vice President Dick Cheney forcefully stated that the war on terror empowered the Bush administration to act without the need for evidence or extensive analysis.\n\n\u0026gt;Suskind describes the Cheney doctrine as follows: \"Even if there\u0027s just a 1 percent chance of the unimaginable coming due, act as if it is a certainty. It\u0027s not about \u0027our analysis,\u0027 as Cheney said. It\u0027s about \u0027our response.\u0027 … Justified or not, fact-based or not, \u0027our response\u0027 is what matters.

And sometimes, of course, the probability justifying action of some sort is even less than 1 percent. Vaccines are routinely given, for example, even for diseases whose risk of being contracted is much less than 1 percent.\n\n\u0026gt;That being granted, the simplistic doctrine of \"if at least 1 percent, then act\" is especially frightening in international conflicts, not least because the number of threats misconstrued (by someone or other) to meet the 1 percent threshold is huge and the consequences of military action are so terrible and irrevocable.\n\nAnd so you see, with the 1 percent doctrine Cheney has created his defense for how they operated.  Moreover, with this doctrine he has created the response to allegations that he lied.  To you it\u0027s a \"lie\" but to him it was being cautious.  And so he would say something like this: \"no, I didn\u0027t lie, it\u0027s just that you people have the luxury of sitting at home and critiquing what we\u0027re doing while we actually have to make difficult decisions about protecting the American people or risk an extraordinarily deadly attack.  And we have to act with imperfect information.  And so it\u0027s not a lie if we decide that we can\u0027t risk the even 1% possibility that Saddam Hussein has WMD.\"\n\nI am not agreeing with Cheney\u0027s logic for how he proceeded.  However, in order for us as a society to move forward on this we do need to stop this stupid back and forth of \"you\u0027re a liar and a war criminal, no I\u0027m not, yes you are, no I\u0027m not.\"  And so if we are to have a serious discussion on all of this I think a good place to start is with a substantive discussion of Cheney\u0027s 1% doctrine.

These people are war criminal, there is no doubt. The question is why \u0026amp; who else is involved. It seems to me that this entire fabrication predominantly severed several purposes.\n\n* The military industrial complex made an absolute riot off this war. The endless demands for ammunition, armor, food stuff, special weapons, equipment, policing, training \u0026amp; much more. \n* Intelligence agencies; both domestic \u0026amp; international, saw their power grow enormously with new laws which allowed them to legally intercept \u0026amp; read every form of electronic communication we send every day; without a warrant. This doesn\u0027t even being to take into account torture, indefinite detention, kidnapping \u0026amp; much more.\n* Plutocrats. This war was launched in conjunction with massive tax breaks for the wealthiest people on the planet and corporations. Not only did they not have to pay for their war, the rest of the citizens would foot the enormous bill while their freedoms would be sacrificed at the alter of terrorism \u0026amp; security. \n\nOf course there are more elements to the story but what seems very clear to me is that those in power are openly waging a class war against the middle and poor class of our country. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIt\u0027s important to remember that corporations are simply massive concentrations of private power. These corporations essentially have a virtual monopoly on the worlds basic resources. Just a few of them. This entails that policy is fitted to satisfy the continuation of the monopoly of these resources. There can be nothing more radically anti-democratic then this type of system.
