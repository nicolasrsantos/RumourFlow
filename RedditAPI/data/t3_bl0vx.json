We need bullshit detectors.","selftextHTML":"\u0026lt;!-- SC_OFF --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div class\u003d\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The idea is fairly straightforward. A few key urban legend clearinghouse websites (e.g. \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://www.snopes.com/\"\u0026gt;snopes.com\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://urbanlegends.about.com/\"\u0026gt;urbanlegends.about.com\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;) are indexed thoroughly. Then, as emails are opened, the text is scanned for key phrases (e.g. \u0026amp;quot;Obama is a muslim\u0026amp;quot;) and a prominent message is displayed to the user with a link to the appropriate website for debunking or confirmation and maybe a red/green indicator image.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;With so much garbage floating around on the Internet, this is absolutely a necessary tool to help filter out blatant lies that are passed around. It won\u0026amp;#39;t necessarily fix things, but hopefully it will improve them.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A nice extension to this would be if an email is about to be forwarded to a large number of people, then a dialog box comes up asking the user if they have checked the truth of this email forward and stating that it is not good netiquette to forward things without looking them up first.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Thank you for reading and please get on it.
