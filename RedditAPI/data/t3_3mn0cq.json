Sure, we could forcibly distribute it, but what are the affects on wealth growth because of that?\n\nThere are essentially two types of economists:\n\n1. Those that believe money is money and it does not matter who is in possession of it. In other words, a poor man with a dollar and a rich man with a dollar affect future growth the same. \n\n2. Those that believe some dollars affect growth more than other dollars. Simply put, an investment banker with an extra dollar can create more growth than a poor man with an extra dollar. \n\nIn scenario (1) there is no objective morality regarding distribution. It does not really matter who has the money. You could hold the morality that if an individual is in possession of it, it is their property and should not be taken from them. That individual either earned it through work or inherited it from someone\u0027s labor and that someone wanted the individual to have that money. You could also take the moral stance that you have: some people have a lot of money and some have little so we should redistribute it. \n\nScenario one is wrong. Imagine person A is capable of growing wealth. Imagine person B is only capable of a one time transaction of wealth. Person A could invest a dollar, have that dollar grow, and then reinvest more money into the economy. Person B can spend that dollar for an even trade and only ever have the value of $1. If Person B spent the dollar on food, his wealth is lost and the economy only grew very little. If he bought a non-perishable item with the dollar, then he only ever has a dollar\u0027s worth of wealth to grow the economy. \n\nNow, by this logic, all money ever should be given to investors. This is clearly ridiculous. But at the same time, redistributing wealth has negative consequences on future economic growth.

Sure, we could forcibly distribute it, but what are the affects on wealth growth because of that?\n\nThere are essentially two types of economists:\n\n1. Those that believe money is money and it does not matter who is in possession of it. In other words, a poor man with a dollar and a rich man with a dollar affect future growth the same. \n\n2. Those that believe some dollars affect growth more than other dollars. Simply put, an investment banker with an extra dollar can create more growth than a poor man with an extra dollar. \n\nIn scenario (1) there is no objective morality regarding distribution. It does not really matter who has the money. You could hold the morality that if an individual is in possession of it, it is their property and should not be taken from them. That individual either earned it through work or inherited it from someone\u0027s labor and that someone wanted the individual to have that money. You could also take the moral stance that you have: some people have a lot of money and some have little so we should redistribute it. \n\nScenario one is wrong. Imagine person A is capable of growing wealth. Imagine person B is only capable of a one time transaction of wealth. Person A could invest a dollar, have that dollar grow, and then reinvest more money into the economy. Person B can spend that dollar for an even trade and only ever have the value of $1. If Person B spent the dollar on food, his wealth is lost and the economy only grew very little. If he bought a non-perishable item with the dollar, then he only ever has a dollar\u0027s worth of wealth to grow the economy. \n\nNow, by this logic, all money ever should be given to investors. This is clearly ridiculous. But at the same time, redistributing wealth has negative consequences on future economic growth. A happy medium between the two is the first morality I mentioned in a country with a small safety net.

So you\u0027re talking a fractional increase in labor.  Secondly, having twice as many widgets on the market, you\u0027re only going to be able to lower the price a small amount, because the production costs are only a part of the final price.

So you\u0027re going to be left with a glut of product and no buyers.

The meltdown was the consequence of a combination of the easy money and low interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve and the easy housing engineered by a variety of government agencies and policies.\n\nhttps://reason.com/archives/2012/10/14/clintons-legacy-the-financial-and-housin\n\n\u0026gt; A significant contributing factor in the slowdown was the policy direction of the Clinton administration, which included an aggressive use of antitrust regulation in the high-tech marketplace, a lack of a national energy policy which resulted in energy-price spikes, and a high and rising federal tax burden. A key area in which presidents can have an impact on the economy is tax policy. President Clinton raised tax rates right after taking office in 1993, and presided over a massive \"stealth tax hike\" which ultimately hurt the economy.\n\n\n\nhttp://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-80312\n\n\nhttp://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid\u003dnewsarchive\u0026amp;sid\u003dazwhJVa5rWhU","duration":"","id":144,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cvgsrhh","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":142,"links":[141],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"KulpDontCare","label":"This comment is worded poorly.

There are corporations that wind up receiving tax credits at the end of each year. Besides which, effective corporate tax rates have been steadily [declining since the 50s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_Effective_Corporate_Tax_Rate_1947-2011_v2.jpg). The tax burden was [shifted from the highest earners to the lowest earned in the 80s](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Historical_Mariginal_Tax_Rate_for_Highest_and_Lowest_Income_Earners.jpg) and it has never shifted back. The tiny bumps here and there are meaningless.\n\nThe only \"massive keynesian stimulus package\" we\u0027ve had recently was in response to a tanked economy. And it wasn\u0027t nearly as large as it should have been considering how low interest rates already were. Just about the worst thing you can do during a spiraling recession is to cut spending and stagnate the flow of capital. It is the absolute WORST time to worry about the deficit. Arguing for austerity after the 2008 crash was like worrying that the dessert trolly was tipped over on the Titanic.\n\nSupply side doesn\u0027t work. It\u0027s never worked. It is predicated on a very specific set of circumstances where tax cuts at the upper levels can spurn economic growth, but America has never had the right conditions (or the right tax rates) for it to have any effect. It\u0027s a sham.\n\nThe two basic principles of supply side economics are to lower taxes to encourage investment and reductions in government regulations. Except lowering already-low tax rates do jack shit to \"spurn investment\". And the magic of deregulation is a fairy tale. Yes, individual businesses make a greater profit, but society on a whole pays a greater cost for that profit.\n\nThere is no such thing as serious talk about voodoo economics. I\u0027d love it if there were some magic way to cut taxes AND improve tax revenue. If there were, EVERYONE would do it and there would be no argument. But there isn\u0027t.

Part of the problem is huge corporations can lobby for special treatment, and they can hire expensive accountants to find loopholes. That\u0027s not only inefficient, but it also does nothing for small businesses.\n\n\u0026gt;2) the budget actually ran a surplus under Clinton and the 30 year treasury auctions were set to be retired until a Bush decided to enact massive tax cuts coupled with a war on two fronts (Iraq/Afghanistan). Budget deficits have been consistent for the last decade due to this and other reasons, which leads me to...\n\nAnd Clinton\u0027s economy was some sort of liberal utopia? The guy continued to push globalization which was largely initiated by Reagan, he cut capital gains taxes, he ran a surplus (thanks to the Republican congress). And I\u0027m not defending any wars.\n\n\u0026gt;3) We bailed out the banks. Yep. Sure did. The major banks essentially all insolvent due to the mortgage crisis and subsequent rapid devaluing of CMOS. Why did the mortgage crisis happen? Well, a lack of regulation for one (500k loan on stated income for a waitress who works 20 hours a week at Denny\u0027s? Approved!!) but also because of the repeal of the Glass-Steagal act which let commercial banks use capital to purchase risky assets. (Spoiler: those bets didn\u0027t exactly pay off). Supply side economic theory is 100% responsible for this fiasco.\n\nSo we get rid of glass-steagal, but the government pushes for (and MANDATES) low income loans, and we have mark-to-market accounting, and somehow you know that the crisis was due to not enough regulation. It\u0027s just a bit disingenuous to look at a system with huge amounts of government involvement and say that the crash is due to not enough government involvement. Are there regulations that could have stopped the crash? Of course, regulations can stop anything. But does that mean the crash itself is a failure of the free market? Of course not.\n\nI mean let\u0027s just take a step back and think about what you\u0027re saying. Here are these enormous banks and they are designed to take the sum total of all human knowledge and use it to figure out which loans will make them money and which won\u0027t. And you think this institution just systematically made bad bets for.... basically no reason? I have no doubt the banks and bankers are super greedy, but wouldn\u0027t greed mean they want people to pay back their loans?\n\n\u0026gt;4) interest rates decreasing is an interesting topic. They have been at essentially 0 for 5 years in an attempt to stimulate credit facilities and increase money velocity following the recession, but to have a discussion regarding the effects of interest rate (and FOMC) policy outside of an academic setting is pretty silly in my opinion.\n\nWe\u0027re talking about supply-side economics, or Austrian economics, or chicago school of economics, or right-wing economics, or whatever you wanna call it, and we\u0027re not allowed to talk about interest rates? o.O\n\n\u0026gt;5) the first stimulus packages started as the economy began to contract following the war in Iraq. These stimulus packages were a Hail Mary to inject money into the economy that actually didn\u0027t work all that great, mainly because their scope was too limited, or too concentrated (bailing out the banks, while helping to stop systemic failure of the financial system actually did little to stimulate the economy like publics works projects would, despite being the largest \"stimulus\" in history).\n\nSurely you can understand the skepticism when you say \"we just didn\u0027t do enough\" after a $1 trillion stimulus, several rounds of QE, and interest rates at 0 for years? I mean jesus, you guys talk about supply-side economics being given a fair shot. This presidency has been a Keynesian free-for-all and the economy still sucks.\n\n\u0026gt;I dunno man. Everything you use as an example pretty much shows that supply side is bullshit. Regulations are necessary in a capitalist economy, and it\u0027s amazing that people still think otherwise.\n\nIt\u0027s just complete delusion to think we\u0027ve had 35 years of supply-side economics. I never said all regulations are bad.","duration":"","id":351,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cvgvemv","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":349,"links":[346],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"themaxvoltage","label":"Your points actually give credibility to the fact that supply side is bullshit, and I\u0027m going to explain, but you\u0027ll probably disregard it anyways.

The US has essentially been on the left side of the curve since JFK tax cuts went into effect in 1964.\n\n\u0026gt;PAUL SOLMAN: Well, of course not, but is that what would happen?\n\n\u0026gt;Not necessarily, says Nobel laureate economist Peter Diamond, a tax expert. You may recall he was nominated by President Obama for the Federal Reserve Board, blocked by Senate Republicans.\n\n\u0026gt;PETER DIAMOND, Massachusetts Institute of Technology: If you want to shoot tax dollars in the direction of business creation, you have got to ask, who is it that’s having trouble getting financing? It’s not the high-earners. It’s further down the income distribution.\n\n\u0026gt;PETER DIAMOND: We have a lot of studies, based on the available data, on the relationship between tax rates and the amount of revenue you get. It’s very close to certain that the current 35 percent is almost surely below, and comfortably below, what would maximize the revenue. So, I’m very comfortable that the top marginal income tax rate, high 40s, 50s, on up, maybe even into the low 60s.\n\n\u0026gt;PAUL SOLMAN: So, according to the data, says Peter Diamond, the Laffer Curve might really look some thing like this. And where would Diamond himself put the top tax rate?\n\n\u0026gt;At about 49 percent, still comfortably below the point of maximum tax revenue — 49 percent or so would have positive economic effects, short-term and long, by financing government investment in infrastructure, in education, in research and development, says Diamond, all key components of economic growth.\n\n\u0026gt;In fact, Arthur Laffer is sympathetic.\n\n[video and transcript here](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business-jan-june12-makingsense_01-11/)","duration":"","id":517,"color":"black","redditID":"t1_cvgz5wx","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":515,"links":[514],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Raynonymous","label":"I will rephrase: in the article, the author states that economists agree that lowering taxes motivates people to work harder, so I was wondering, What is the evidence behind the claim that lowering taxes motivates people to work harder?","duration":"","id":515,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_cvgpxc3","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":514,"links":[513],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Daveb138","label":"I\u0027m not sure I understand what you\u0027re asking.","duration":"","id":514,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_cvgli57","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":513,"links":[512],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Raynonymous","label":"Why is the assumption that lowering taxes incentivises people to work harder not controversial?

I am being downvoted, not because people are annoyed at my pretentiousness or whatever, it\u0027s because I\u0027m being viewed as a traitor against the democrats. That\u0027s my whole point here. There should not be a war waged between republicans and democrats. When I hear a politician say something like \"regardless if I am elected or not, we need to make sure at least another republic wins. We need to keep democrats out of office.\" It makes my stomach turn. Where is the balance and cooperation of views. Where is the unity in that? Coming from liberal democrats who usually preach acceptance, human rights, coexistence, etc, I\u0027m shocked and disappointed to see such aggressive attitudes toward anything republican or conservative. It goes against everything I believe which makes me more liberal. It is okay to ride the fence and have overlapping views. It\u0027s not what party you stand for, it\u0027s your views that matter. This whole topic and conversation is an example of my point. Why would I be so prosecuted for calling for balance and cooperation rather than extreme polarization and separation? Is that not the essence of what being a liberal is all about? You presume to know what kind of guy I am and call me names and be blatantly rude, and discredit me by accusing me of being stupid or ha I a big ego, or negative intentions. That is not a fair angle to play here and it\u0027s not very logical.

I am willing to talk. What I am not willing to do is entertain a discussion where people claim \"objective truths\" in many places where it is more realistically opinion. There is nothing wrong with an opinion, but we should remain honest with ourselves and each other. The amount of bias denial and hypocrisy I see in just this past of the thread under what I\u0027ve posted is of a religious extremist likeness. I say that because when people use language such as their opinion being the truth, or that the entire arena of their counterparts is objectively wrong, it speaks to a dangerous sense of closed mindedness and superiority. That is not how government is supposed to work. There are supposed to be discussions, as you\u0027ve just pointed out. And just as you expect, and would like, for me to have a civil discussion with you where we address each other fairly and hear each other out. Do you see that happening within the areas of Reddit? Personally I do not see that. I see a self fueling one sided conversation with a coal of bias burning hotter and hotter. It seems a safe haven for a certain political/ social ideology where the counterparts, or anyone of another ideology holds no ground or voice that will be fairly heard, and much less actually considered and compromised with. Hell, just the mention of the bias got me rapid downvotes and backlash. I understand that this is the liberal church, so to speak, but the bias and closed mindedness is becoming something that makes me frustrated with my side of the arena.
