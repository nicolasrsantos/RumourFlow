the origins and evolution of isil investigating evidence of genocide in myanmar  may   gmt  europe us  canada sepp blatter south africa fifa while accepting the trust of world football has to be regained fifa president sepp blatter has responded to the arrest of top officials from the sports governing body by insisting it showed his efforts to eradicate corruption were working the deepest crisis in fifas year history is threatening blatters bid to win a fifth fouryear term in a contest against prince ali bin alhussein of jordan on friday with european football leaders trying to delay the election as unfortunate as these events are it should be clear that we welcome the actions and the investigations by the us and swiss authorities and believe that it will help to reinforce measures that fifa has already taken to root out any wrongdoing in football blatter said on wednesday let me be clear such misconduct has no place in football and we will ensure that those who engage in it are put out of the game we will continue to work with the relevant authorities and we will work vigorously within fifa  to regain your trust call for resignation blatters comments came as greg dyke the chairman of the english football association said blatter should leave his job immediately in the wake of the arrests dykes comments went further than european footballs governing body uefa which called only for a sixmonth delay in fridays scheduled fifa presidential vote dyke said he was unconvinced by blatters declaration that fifa can regain the trust of football fans by stepping up efforts to root out corruption blatter has put out a statement saying now is the time to start rebuilding the trust in fifa  there is no way of rebuilding trust in fifa while sepp blatter is still there dyke said early thursday in zurich sepp blatter has to go he either has to go through a resignation or he has to be outvoted or we have to find a third way i think the time has come where the damage this has done to fifa is so great that it cant be rebuilt while blatter is there so uefa has got to try to force him out hotel raid a swiss criminal investigation into the bidding contest for the  and  world cups was sparked by fifa handing over a secret ethics investigation report to authorities in november electronic data and documents were seized at fifas headquarters early on wednesday by investigators who said they will question  executive committee members who took part in the world cup votes in december  the swiss announcement came after  people were indicted in the us for football corruption  seven of whom were arrested by zurich police after a raid at a luxury hotel the detained executives including vice presidents jeffrey webb and eugenio figueredo were in the swiss city for the fifa congress webb and figueredo were among  people provisionally suspended from world football by fifa warner granted m bail fifas ethics committee including former executive committee members jack warner nicolas leoz and chuck blazer were suspended despite no longer being involved in the game the others are costa rican soccer federation president eduardo li venezuela fa chief rafael esquivel former brazilian fa chief jose maria marin costas takkas who works for concacaf president webb fifa development officer julio rocha and warners son daryll fifa executives and others corrupted the process they did this over and over year after year tournament after tournament loretta lynch us attorney general announced at a news conference in new york on wednesday us officials revealed that the  world cup the first time africa hosted the global event was awarded to south africa based on bribes received by some fifa officials warner was expected to spend wednesday night in jail in trinidad after surrendering when police issued an arrest warrant at the request of us authorities who filed corruption charges against him warner appeared in court where a judge read  charges against him and then granted him m bail on certain conditions including that he surrender his passport and report to police twice a week these allegations have been there since time immemorial warner said ahead of his arrest im just saying it does seems strange that us could make these arrests two days before fifa election one has to be naive not to believe that has something to do with it world
