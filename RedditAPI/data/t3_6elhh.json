I know many people come down on Americans and claim their familiarity with such blatant ignorance as typical and it is hard for me to concur as some of my personal heroes are American (Edward Witten, Martin Luther King Jr)\nThe sad truth is America is one of the richest nations on earth with a great number of people who own televisions and have access to the internet. It holds itself as a beacon of knowledge, understanding and tolerance. When faced with such belligerent and insistent ignorance as depicted by this survey it forces the rational mind to rethink its opinions.\nSo I guess what Im trying to say is if you are an informed American then I say good on you and don\u0027t be disheartened by the parade of redditors pissing on the American population as a whole.","duration":"","id":22,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c03mtdf","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Poll: 1 In 10 Think Obama Is Muslim \u0026amp; A Third Don\u0027t Know Or Are Confused..","label":"sid13","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_6elhh","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.207351287E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.20738249E9,"simScore":0.8474498732066158,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":23,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"bsimmons666","label":"The other two thirds think he\u0027s asian.","duration":"","id":23,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c03mtk4","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Poll: 1 In 10 Think Obama Is Muslim \u0026amp; A Third Don\u0027t Know Or Are Confused..","label":"sid13","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_6elhh","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.207351287E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.207383839E9,"simScore":0.6569702382243815,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},{"index":24,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"haoest","label":"Nineteen percent of americans approve of Bush\u0027s presidency, so it takes alot to surprise me.\n\n","duration":"","id":24,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c03mtr2","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Poll: 1 In 10 Think Obama Is Muslim \u0026amp; A Third Don\u0027t Know Or Are Confused..","label":"sid13","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_6elhh","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.207351287E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.207385397E9,"simScore":0.7363583331306776,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":25,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"ejp1082","label":"Y\u0027know, I really think that there\u0027s between 20 and 33% of the population that\u0027ll just say anything to pollsters.
