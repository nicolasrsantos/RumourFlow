That\u0027s the only logical result I can get out of your claims. \n\nIf Obama has greatly reduced the number of raids, then he\u0027s obviously increased other forms of identifying and arresting illegal immigrants, because he is deporting more illegal immigrants, as both your \u0026amp; my sources agree. \n\nThe only way that I can tie your claim that Bush was better at catching immigrants but deported less is that he must have let them out of prison and back into the US community.\n\nAs your own link says, Obama both pushed for immigration reform and the dream act. No president can actually do anything unless the congress passes acts, and nether of these has passed.

He issued an executive order requiring all federal contractors and subcontractors to use it to verify employees.\n\nThe negotiations to stay in Iraq failed because the Iraquis don\u0027t want the US there. Ask yourself this, if the situation was reversed, and the US had been invaded,  how much negotiating could the invaders do to remain in the US? \n\nIn the UK, yes the majority of people did not support the Iraq war. In February 2003, just before the start of the war, [52% of people](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2003/feb/18/politics.iraq) were opposed to it, compared to 29% in favour. That\u0027s one of the reasons why it attracted the largest demonstration in UK history. I\u0027m not going to pull up lots of polls to show you this, but that was the high point of support, it only went down from there.\n\nI\u0027d be wondering what going by the wayside means? For example, Obama was the 3rd US president to be invited on a state visit to the UK, and the 2nd to speak before a joint session of Parliament. \n\nAs I said, I don\u0027t know much about India\u0027s relationship.

If you are wondering, I voted for McCain in the last election anyways, though that was mostly because I thought Obama was woefully inexperienced.  I guess that is my biggest issue with him, he just seems inexperienced in business, leadership, foreign affairs, economics, and life in general.  That said, I do think he is a good family man who does honestly care for the people of this country, I just think he is misguided and inept.","duration":"","id":29,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c3n5z43","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Conservatives: Why do you really dislike Obama?","label":"newt4prez","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_p7nrf","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.328219112E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.328220832E9,"simScore":0.7216457493820803,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.328222097E9,"simScore":0.7101810682377394,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.328222097E9,"simScore":0.7269784212233421,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.328224557E9,"simScore":0.6202849312055352,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.328226377E9,"simScore":0.5898821554590825,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.328227117E9,"simScore":0.5447721406274753,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":45,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"spartanburger91","label":"He campaigned on a platform of openness.

I believe that what money I make I should be able to keep, or as much of it as possible, to give my family the fruits of my labour.  I feel Obama is too concerned with speading wealth through social projects and govenment handouts to be concerned with how hardworking Americans feel their paycheck should be spent.  I believe govenment should have less involvment in making my daily decisions and do more to support our freedom to choose for ourselves.  \n\nI believe our govenment is out of control in regards to spending, both foreign and domestic, and out of control in the amount of regulation in areas not granted to the federal government in the Constitution, but rather \u0027created\u0027 by poloticians by stretching the reading of the Commerce Clause to reductio ad absurdum.   \n\nI believe he is creating class warfare in his rhetoric and is adding to our problems as a nation by turning one class on the other distracting us from the real problem, the government itself.  The govenment has the income now to pay off the debt if proper fiscal responsibility were used.  Reduce pork spending and cut off the federal govenments involvment in areas that were reserved to the states, such as education for example, and apply this money to the debt.  I believe the wealthy should not have to pay 40% of their income to the govenement, but neither should any other American.  I do not believe it is right for Obama to crusade against a small part of the populous while about 50% of Americans pay little or NO tax at all, yet still have the ability to vote and affect how this money is collected and spent.  \n\nI do not agree with his policies in regard to healthcare insofar as I do not believe \u0027healtcare as a right\u0027 is consistent with the fundamental principles of capitalism, the Constitution, nor is is beneficial to the healthcare industry itself.  \n\nI feel as though he believes that Americans should trust the federal government without question and that he believes that all the answers come from a large federal govenment and removing a states ability to govern themselves as they choose. \n\nI am not a Republican but I have voted for them before as the lesser of evils in my eyes, but I have never viewed the Democrats as fighting for things I believe is best for the average middle class hard working American white male.  I believe that both parties make the problem worse, and the problem is an overreaching federal govenment; however, no politician is ever going to voluntarily give these powers back to the states where it rightly belongs.  \n\nTL;DR : I do not support Obama because of his domestic policies of class warfare, expanding the roles of the federal govenment, and deficit spending.\n\n","duration":"","id":63,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c3n9rjr","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Conservatives: Why do you really dislike Obama?","label":"newt4prez","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_p7nrf","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.328219112E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.328242092E9,"simScore":0.566085992065154,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":64,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"randsfoodstamps","label":"Conservatives on Reddit?
