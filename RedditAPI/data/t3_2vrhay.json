In my mind freedom of speech shouldn\u0027t apply the same way to corporations as it does to citizens. Corporations are spending money in the hope that the candidate they back will introduce legislation that is favorable to them, not necessarily the public. Our federal government is for the people, by the people. When corporations back candidates who don\u0027t act in their favor they threaten to cut off funding or find someone else willing to play ball. Our elected officials should not be basing their decisions on making their donors happy, they should be working towards the goals of their constituents. I have no problem with businesses spending money on campaigns (to a degree) as long as they can\u0027t hide behind the \"American Loving Patriots, Let freedom ring\" SuperPac, their company logo should go straight on whatever ads they are producing. When our current system morphed into the shady monster we see today the public really lost it\u0027s check power on our politicians and has been usurped by corporations. By definition a corporation is in the business of making money regardless of the product or service they provide. \n\nToday the stats are clear, in the U.S. the top 0.1% of Americans own as much wealth as the bottom 90%. These are families like the Koch\u0027s who own huge companies and benefit personally when politicians reduce regulations or corporate taxes. They certainly have the right to support whoever they want and can donate as individuals to their campaigns. The SuperPac system is merely a loophole of campaign finance laws that has allowed corporate interests to hijack the election process and our democratic republic system. \n\ntldr: Individual contributions to candidates are already limited. Politicians have essentially become fundraisers rather than legislators under our current campaign finance laws. Current campaign finance regulations allow special interests to push their agendas, out of the public view, that are often detrimental to the vast majority of the general public.\n","duration":"","id":124,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_cokmq92","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":66,"links":[65],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"TheNicestMonkey","label":"\u0026gt;What is a good rebuttal to the notion that money is speech?\n\nThere isn\u0027t one because money spent on speech *is* speech.

I do everything the same as McDonald\u0027s.  The name, the logo, the food, the happy meals, etc....\n\nMcDonald\u0027s sues.  They allege that my impersonation of their business has lost them one million dollars and that I be forced to close my business and pay the damages.  While this falls under the civil side of the law it\u0027s not hard to see how it doesn\u0027t matter if it\u0027s technically \"illegal\".  \n\nSince, McDonald\u0027s has taken my money and forced my business to close they have effectively limited my and my corporation\u0027s speech.  Especially since speech is money.  \n\nWe accept these and many other restrictions on speech.  There\u0027s a long-ass list of them beyond the dozens of examples in copyright law.  They include the ability to impersonate a police officer, NDA\u0027s, employment contracts, impersonating another person, child pornography, etc etc etc.  The list goes on.  Not all are criminal cases, but civil cases have the same effect when talking about the effects it has on the ability to exercise the 1st Amendment.\n\n\u0026gt;What exactly is the democratic republic being protected from? Citizens United was simply trying to publish and on-demand movie about Hillary Clinton. Our Republic will crumble if we all have access to a movie about Hillary Clinton?\n\nI thought my edit\n\n\u0026gt;I\u0027m not necessarily against the narrow ruling of the Hillary movie. It was the second (broader) ruling I have a problem with.\n\nWas very clear about how I feel about the Hillary movie.  I\u0027m not against the court\u0027s ruling in regard to the specific case of the movie.  I\u0027m against the second and broader ruling.  But we\u0027ll come back to that later, because discussing the Citizens United case alone misses a lot.\n\nSo, let\u0027s talk about this statement which I think illustrates where me and you differ quite a lot.\n\n\u0026gt;Quid-pro-quo corruption based on donations to candidates or their campaigns are already HEAVILY regulated in the US, and the Supreme Court has upheld these regulations.\n\nWho is talking about Quid-pro-quo?  Nobody.  Surely, you don\u0027t think anyone familiar with the topic is discussing this.  We have been keeping this type of direct corruption in check since the Gilded Age.  It\u0027s not an issue in 2015.\n\nHowever, there is corruption in Washington on a massive scale.  Which comes in the form of campaign dollars.  But does Exxon or the AFL-CIO have to tell you what they want?  Of course not.  As a politician you already know.  You know and they know.  Everybody knows.  And if they contribute to your campaign and you want to stay in office you better do what they want.  Just because it isn\u0027t Quid-pro-quo doesn\u0027t mean the effects aren\u0027t the same.\n\nThe Citizens United ruling is one small part of the larger picture.  In fact, it aggravates me a bit when people just want to talk about this issue.  However, I\u0027m familiar with it and am willing to do so.  So, here we go.\n\nWhen Justice Roberts asked for the case to be heard again he really opened the flood gates.  I don\u0027t know about you, but I see a massive difference in a 2 hour (or however long) documentary and millions of dollars being poured into 30 second snippets that take over the airwaves.  It gives such a massive influence to special interests.\n\n\u0026gt;ban the publication of books\n\nThis was never at stake in Citizens United.\n\nIn conclusion, I think too often we get hung up on certain court cases.  Citizens United is one part of the topic of corruption.  I hope people band together and try to get this government back.  Because right now our government is sick and I hope you at least agree with that.\n\nBy the way, there are plenty of solutions to resolving some of the corruption in Washington without limiting speech.  One such proposal looks something like this: Every citizen gets $100 dollars on their tax return.  They have a few options of what to do with that money.  They can give it to an individual candidate or to a party.  If neither of those are chosen, the money goes towards funding polls and registering voters.  Edit: I forgot to add that if a politician wants this money they have to give up the right to any other form of donation.  I believe something like this is already in place in Connecticut and a couple other states.\n\nIn relation to the specifics of the affects of Citizens United: It is certainly trickier.  However, I am of the opinion that 30 second commercials can only be put forth if sponsored by and paid for directly from a candidate if political in nature.  The law could look something like this: If political in nature and in paid commercial space of television or radio, and of 5 minutes or less: the production of, cost of commercial space, and all other related expenses must come directly from a political candidate if within 3 months of a related election.

Slander, libel, lying under oath, incitements to riot - all are speech - but they are restricted or banned due to the great public interest served by doing so. \n\nIt has already been [proven](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage\u003donline\u0026amp;aid\u003d9354310\u0026amp;fileId\u003dS1537592714001595) that the only people whose preferences currently affect policy outcomes are the rich. It has also been shown that the candidate who spends more wins the vast majority of the time. Both of these facts (or either, really) could easily be construed as anathema to the idea of a representative democracy. As such, there is a good case to be made that the government has a vested interest in restricting this type of speech to some degree (as they already have in the case of the $5000 limit). You can compare it to the idea that you have the right to bear arms, but not the right to own a nuclear warhead.

But despite that **we can still regulate political money** (even without a constitutional amendment.)\n\n\n- - -\n\nBut first, lets demonstrate why political money is speech:\n\nImagine you\u0027re a liberal anti-war protestor in Texas. You and you fellow protestors decide to use pink-ribbons as a symbol for your anti-war protests. You put pink ribbons on arms, fingers, your front door, etc. Texas\u0027s lawmakers don\u0027t like you doing that so they ban the public display of pink ribbons. Is this a violation of free speech? Of course. Why? Because despite the ribbons not being literally speech, they\u0027re a proxy for speech.\n\n\n- - -\n\nNow back to how we can justify regulating political money (which is speech):\n\n* Conservatives \u0026amp; Libertarians want to frame efforts at Campaign Finance Reform (CFR) in the most minimal way possible: As violations of free speech, compared in a vacuum, with no other input. That effectively boils down to a law versus a constitutional right, and the latter always wins.\n\n* A more honest way to frame the issue is constitutional right versus constitutional right: Free speech vs your constitutional right to representation (and implicit in your right to representation is that it isn\u0027t corrupt).\n\nAn example of favoring other constitutional rights over free speech  that nobody complains about are court gag orders. A court gag order is suppressing literal speech, which at a quick glance seems to violate the 1st amendment, but we justify it by saying that we need to violate the 1st amendment to protect the 6th amendment (trial by impartial jury).\n\nSo while we should limit money used in politics, we should not do so by saying “money isn\u0027t speech”. We don\u0027t need to resort to that kind of argument, and if we did, it\u0027s risky for free speech.\n\nLawrence Lessig is arguably the leading advocate for CFR, and a Harvard law professor.  And [he agrees.](http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/17166737111/money-is-not-speech)\n\n- - -\n\nBut of course the aforementioned legal argument only puts regulated political money on equal footing with free speech as both sides are invoking constitutional justifications.  So you could make the above argument, and fail in court because the SCOTUS justices decided your right to speech speech ought to trump right to your right to representation.\n\nA constitutional amendment would be nice to have since it would effectively be forcing an interpretation that prefers representation over speech.","duration":"","id":234,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_col3zra","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":65,"links":[64],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"aseaman1","label":"This is the rebuttal I get from conservatives and libertarians when discussing money in politics.

For (a simple) example, a legislator might be a doctor and you\u0027re discussing cancer and carcinogens. Now let\u0027s expand that. \n\nNow some real examples: This legislator a regular legislator, he was a new legislator, didn\u0027t get his pick of committees and gets stuck on the Africa committee. Holy crap, how is he going to go back home and talk about his headline grabbing work on the Africa committee, no one even knows that\u0027s a committee, what does his rust belt state care about Africa? But whatever, he works hard and hard at that job, keeps getting reelected, keeps learning and working, knows all the players and keeps getting power ALL WHILE BEING DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE TO HIS CONSTITUENTS. Now he ends wars, argues with the UN and State Department and the foreign offices of other countries effectively to get his desired outcome, all while being directly responsible to his constituents. \n\nShit, in alternate universe that legislator got stuck on Africa, worked his hardest, but he\u0027s out of the game, out of the system he\u0027s had his 10 or 12 years. Guess who knows the game and knows the system, though lacks the power of the office? Lobbyists.  People who like the legislator spend their lifetime on one specific issue. Except their not responsible to anyone. They work for their shop. Their shop says Africa is bad, we need less money going there. They are now an expert pushing a policy position to lawmakers who have zero knowledge and zero chance to learn. \n\nThis is common. Some of my longest meetings with lobbyists were over PVC piping. Literally PVC piping, not abortion, not drugs, not sentencing guidelines, but the interaction between PVC and metal piping systems. It was with a first term legislator being stuck on a committee like the Africa example, with no knowledge. So now that legislator is literally balancing the two sides against each other, not the two sides against his own knowledge. He had no reason or impetus to learn this issue before getting into office and had to balance them out in his head. Thankfully he was able to decide his issue and it proved to be the right course of action. Well now 8 years on he\u0027s the foremost expert in the state on PVC piping regulations and regularly beats back efforts to modify them in a way he deems detrimental to the people of the state. All while being directly accountable.

The key mistake you\u0027re making in thinking about this is the assumption that politicians are solely those who hold office, therefore meaning that by adding term limits it would be impossible for one to make a career out of it. That view is incorrect. To be a politician one does not necesarily be directly involved in government, one simply needs to be active in politics. In your theoretical world where term limits are imposed, political parties would still exist. In fact they would have to exist, otherwise there would be very little unofficial internal organization to steer debate and control the shifting of power (seniority would presumably replace parties if parties were abolished, but with mandatory term limits seniority becomes moot). So we would still have parties, and those parties would need leadership. The DNC and GOP are extremely well funded, broad, powerful organizations; their organizational and internal hierarchy will not  go away. In fact their hierarchy will only become more important, as they will quickly become the most powerful voices in the party. They will be the \"new\" power brokers (I quote that because there\u0027s really nothing new about that, they already are power brokers), and will help fund statesmen, organize platforms and strategies, and secure post-office (not post office, though funnily enough post-master general was a coveted position to have) jobs in the private sector.\n\nSound unbelievable? We already had a system of unofficial bureaucrats and power brokers that ran the political infrastructure in American communities, they\u0027re known as party machines. Tammany Hall and her contemporaries operated exactly in this structure, and they flourished. What I\u0027m saying here is that a term limit system wouldn\u0027t remove career politicians, it would just revive an old form of politics that many contemporary political scientists believe died. \n\nOne of my main areas is 19th century American political history, so if you want more details on party machines and their structures feel free to ask, I love talking about them.","duration":"","id":645,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cokkyak","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":625,"links":[624],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"xterminatr","label":"Not really true in my opinion.

It\u0027s a lot more complicated and a pretty terrible example to use.\n\n\u0026gt;\"Shouting fire in a crowded theater\" is a popular metaphor for speech or actions made for the principal purpose of creating unnecessary panic. The phrase is a paraphrasing of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.\u0027s opinion in the United States Supreme Court case Schenck v. United States in 1919, **which held that the defendant\u0027s speech in opposition to the draft during World War I was not protected free speech under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.**\n\n\u0026gt;The paraphrasing does not generally include the word \"falsely\", i.e., \"falsely shouting fire in a crowded theater\", which was the original wording used in Holmes\u0027s opinion and highlights that speech which is dangerous and false is not protected, as opposed to speech which is truthful but also dangerous.\n\nBut that\u0027s not even the standard that\u0027s used these days. Schenck set a \"clear and present danger\" standard. No the standard is \"inciting imminant lawless action.\" \n\n\u0026gt;Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case based on the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Court held that government cannot punish inflammatory speech unless that speech is directed to inciting, and is likely to incite, imminent lawless action.[1] Specifically, it struck down Ohio\u0027s criminal syndicalism statute, because that statute broadly prohibited the mere advocacy of violence. In the process, Whitney v. California[2] was explicitly overruled, and doubt was cast on Schenck v. United States,[3] Abrams v. United States,[4] Gitlow v. New York (1925), and Dennis v. United States.[5]\n\nSo the original ruling which noted the \"fire\" metaphor actually did significant damage to the first amendment, and was only fixed when it as essentially overturned 40 years later.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater","duration":"","id":741,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_colxnmr","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":740,"links":[739],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Accujack","label":"\u0026gt;  absolutely destroying the first amendment\n\nSure, just like limiting the ability to yell \"Fire!\" in a crowded theater \"destroyed\" the first amendment.\n\nRights aren\u0027t absolute, there will always be a need to strike a balance between individual rights and the greater good.\n","duration":"","id":740,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cokwuof","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":739,"links":[738],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Falmarri","label":"You can\u0027t without absolutely destroying the first amendment and entrenching the existing parties.","duration":"","id":739,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_cokh67j","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":738,"links":[623],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"goldandguns","label":"How can you take money out of politics?

It\u0027s a lot more complicated and a pretty terrible example to use.\n\n\u0026gt;\"Shouting fire in a crowded theater\" is a popular metaphor for speech or actions made for the principal purpose of creating unnecessary panic. The phrase is a paraphrasing of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.\u0027s opinion in the United States Supreme Court case Schenck v. United States in 1919, **which held that the defendant\u0027s speech in opposition to the draft during World War I was not protected free speech under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.**\n\n\u0026gt;The paraphrasing does not generally include the word \"falsely\", i.e., \"falsely shouting fire in a crowded theater\", which was the original wording used in Holmes\u0027s opinion and highlights that speech which is dangerous and false is not protected, as opposed to speech which is truthful but also dangerous.\n\nBut that\u0027s not even the standard that\u0027s used these days. Schenck set a \"clear and present danger\" standard. No the standard is \"inciting imminant lawless action.\" \n\n\u0026gt;Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case based on the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Court held that government cannot punish inflammatory speech unless that speech is directed to inciting, and is likely to incite, imminent lawless action.[1] Specifically, it struck down Ohio\u0027s criminal syndicalism statute, because that statute broadly prohibited the mere advocacy of violence. In the process, Whitney v. California[2] was explicitly overruled, and doubt was cast on Schenck v. United States,[3] Abrams v. United States,[4] Gitlow v. New York (1925), and Dennis v. United States.[5]\n\nSo the original ruling which noted the \"fire\" metaphor actually did significant damage to the first amendment, and was only fixed when it as essentially overturned 40 years later.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater","duration":"","id":741,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_colxnmr","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":740,"links":[739],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Accujack","label":"\u0026gt;  absolutely destroying the first amendment\n\nSure, just like limiting the ability to yell \"Fire!\" in a crowded theater \"destroyed\" the first amendment.\n\nRights aren\u0027t absolute, there will always be a need to strike a balance between individual rights and the greater good.\n","duration":"","id":740,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cokwuof","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":739,"links":[738],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Falmarri","label":"You can\u0027t without absolutely destroying the first amendment and entrenching the existing parties.","duration":"","id":739,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_cokh67j","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":738,"links":[623],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"goldandguns","label":"How can you take money out of politics?

Political speech is a public phenomenon. It aims to affect how people behave. It requires money to hire campaign staff, build a Web site, buy political spots and the like. Penniless politicians can’t easily communicate. Limiting my ability to contribute to candidates and parties restricts my First Amendment rights.\n\n\u0026gt;Still, that doesn’t mean that rich contributors can deliver elections. True, many of the wealthy have evaded the limits on candidate contributions by giving to “independent” groups. But the super-rich are not a monolithic bloc. There are super-rich conservatives and super-rich liberals. Business groups are often splintered. Nor does money guarantee victory. After a certain point, more money hits the law of diminishing returns. It can be and is misspent.\n\u0026gt;Whatever donors’ influence, government isn’t the preserve of the wealthy or business interests. Most federal spending goes to the poor and the middle class (70 percent in 2014 are “payments for individuals,” says the Office of Management and Budget, for Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and other programs), and most taxes are paid by the richest 10 percent (53 percent of all federal taxes in 2010, says the Congressional Budget Office). Most regulations target businesses. Sure, business groups and the rich sometimes secure favorable regulations, tax breaks and subsidies. But their triumphs are a small part of the picture.\n\nThats a good core section of it. ^","duration":"","id":1334,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cokgqj9","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1333,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"squashmarks","label":"How does his opposition argue against this?

Sure, if everybody went out and voted together the cumulative effect would be \u0027the will of the people\u0027, but you can\u0027t really argue that special interests do not distort elections and the legislative process, or even influence \u0027the will of the people\u0027.

This is what you initially presented, and I refuted.\n\nTwo: Inequality in scale of communication. This is what your last reply talks about.\n\n\u0026gt; can\u0027t really argue that special interests do not distort elections\n\nAny distortion is minor, and neither good nor bad. I don\u0027t consider any interest, even special ones, communicating their ideas a bad thing. To deny advocacy is to deny the concept of free speech itself, and this is regardless of whomever the speaker is.\n\nI say this in that speakers don\u0027t automatically cause people to agree with them. You aren\u0027t some idiot who never heard of anything before. People willing to go out and vote usually have their minds made up long before the first ad hits. Elections are increasingly about getting your already-secure base to the polls in numbers bigger than the other side is.\n\n\u0026gt; Advertising works, and political ads are advertising\n\nIt disappoints me that you believe this is true. It\u0027s becoming increasingly apparent that ads are increasingly of limited utility compared to other GOTV efforts.\n\nAs another redditor once eloquently put it, a TV is not a magic box that makes you do things against your will.\n\n\u0026gt;  and the legislative process\n\nI have no problem with lobbying in principle, as I suspect you don\u0027t, either. Proper enforcement to prevent quid-pro-quo prevents corruption, no matter the amount of lobbying that takes place.\n\n\u0026gt; New media seems to have a weird way of taking off in unexpected directions\n\nI was speaking more metaphorically. The idea that you can drown out someone\u0027s message with a louder message doesn\u0027t hold up, because there\u0027s infinite ways to communicate ideas. If you want a concrete example, let\u0027s look at the 1994 midterm elections. Think back to 20 years ago, if you can remember back that far: The internet was barely getting started, and mainstream news outlets were supportive of Clinton\u0027s crime bill, which included an Assault Weapon Bans. Big Business supported the ban, Big Media did, Big Government did, and the polls shows that even the public did too. It should have been a slam-dunk for the Democrats to retain the House.\n\nGun owners were denied access to the influence powers that the Big X\u0027s had. So they organized- they used a low-level ground game that organized around gun stores to turn the 1994 election into a wipeout. They were denied influence across the spectrum, but pulled it off in an actual election.\n\nA more recent case: Romney and his allied groups outself Obama in 2012, but Obama still won. Why? Elections are more than a factor of money. Romney had all the charisma of a wooden spoon in blue jeans, and all the money in the world wouldn\u0027t win the election for him.\n\n\u0026gt; but it is obvious that large corporations, industry, and the wealthy have more sway over what happens in politics than regular people, and I believe that it is completely out of scale.\n\nThis has *always* been the case. In every society throughout history. It\u0027s what\u0027s known as the \"Elites.\" You can\u0027t ever get rid of them. Even if you stage a bloody revolution and kill them all, a new group instantly takes their place.  It\u0027s the nature of government and humanity for some to have more influence than others.\n\nIs ours out of \"sync\" historically? I doubt it. I can\u0027t think of any point of time where \"elites\" were put on the back burner. The closest we came was the New Deal, but even then, special interests in the New Deal Coalition were driving the agenda.\n\n\u0026gt; I am arguing about proportion; the line has to be drawn somewhere, I personally think we are beyond what people should accept. Others might think that this line is far off in the distance.\n\nAnd I argue that there can be no line if we still want to call it free speech- because it\u0027s not free anymore.

This is what you initially presented, and I refuted.\n\nTwo: Inequality in scale of communication. This is what your last reply talks about.\n\n\u0026gt; can\u0027t really argue that special interests do not distort elections\n\nAny distortion is minor, and neither good nor bad. I don\u0027t consider any interest, even special ones, communicating their ideas a bad thing. To deny advocacy is to deny the concept of free speech itself, and this is regardless of whomever the speaker is.\n\nI say this in that speakers don\u0027t automatically cause people to agree with them. You aren\u0027t some idiot who never heard of anything before. People willing to go out and vote usually have their minds made up long before the first ad hits. Elections are increasingly about getting your already-secure base to the polls in numbers bigger than the other side is.\n\n\u0026gt; Advertising works, and political ads are advertising\n\nIt disappoints me that you believe this is true. It\u0027s becoming increasingly apparent that ads are increasingly of limited utility compared to other GOTV efforts.\n\nAs another redditor once eloquently put it, a TV is not a magic box that makes you do things against your will.\n\n\u0026gt;  and the legislative process\n\nI have no problem with lobbying in principle, as I suspect you don\u0027t, either. Proper enforcement to prevent quid-pro-quo prevents corruption, no matter the amount of lobbying that takes place.\n\n\u0026gt; New media seems to have a weird way of taking off in unexpected directions\n\nI was speaking more metaphorically. The idea that you can drown out someone\u0027s message with a louder message doesn\u0027t hold up, because there\u0027s infinite ways to communicate ideas. If you want a concrete example, let\u0027s look at the 1994 midterm elections. Think back to 20 years ago, if you can remember back that far: The internet was barely getting started, and mainstream news outlets were supportive of Clinton\u0027s crime bill, which included an Assault Weapon Bans. Big Business supported the ban, Big Media did, Big Government did, and the polls shows that even the public did too. It should have been a slam-dunk for the Democrats to retain the House.\n\nGun owners were denied access to the influence powers that the Big X\u0027s had. So they organized- they used a low-level ground game that organized around gun stores to turn the 1994 election into a wipeout. They were denied influence across the spectrum, but pulled it off in an actual election.\n\nA more recent case: Romney and his allied groups outself Obama in 2012, but Obama still won. Why? Elections are more than a factor of money. Romney had all the charisma of a wooden spoon in blue jeans, and all the money in the world wouldn\u0027t win the election for him.\n\n\u0026gt; but it is obvious that large corporations, industry, and the wealthy have more sway over what happens in politics than regular people, and I believe that it is completely out of scale.\n\nThis has *always* been the case. In every society throughout history. It\u0027s what\u0027s known as the \"Elites.\" You can\u0027t ever get rid of them. Even if you stage a bloody revolution and kill them all, a new group instantly takes their place.  It\u0027s the nature of government and humanity for some to have more influence than others.\n\nIs ours out of \"sync\" historically? I doubt it. I can\u0027t think of any point of time where \"elites\" were put on the back burner. The closest we came was the New Deal, but even then, special interests in the New Deal Coalition were driving the agenda.\n\n\u0026gt; I am arguing about proportion; the line has to be drawn somewhere, I personally think we are beyond what people should accept. Others might think that this line is far off in the distance.\n\nAnd I argue that there can be no line if we still want to call it free speech- because it\u0027s not free anymore. Government stepping in and deciding which speech we want to limit (or ban) is a bad, *bad* idea. The law that was struck down in *Citizens United*, the BCRA, was used as a club to beat conservatives such that liberal voices stayed dominant. There\u0027s every indication that should *CU* be overturned that it would happen again.\n\nI think the Supreme Court said it more eloquently than I can, in *Buckley v Valeo*:\n\n\u0026gt;The concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment, which was designed \u0027to secure \"the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources...\n\nBefore you reply, please read some of Freakonomic\u0027s take on campaign finance from which I based my reply:\n\n[How Much Does Campaign Spending Influence the Election?](http://freakonomics.com/2012/01/17/how-much-does-campaign-spending-influence-the-election-a-freakonomics-quorum/)\n\n[Does Money Really Buy Elections?](http://freakonomics.com/2012/01/12/does-money-really-buy-elections-a-new-marketplace-podcast/)\n\n[Does Campaign Spending Matter?

This is what your last reply talks about.\n\n\u0026gt; can\u0027t really argue that special interests do not distort elections\n\nAny distortion is minor, and neither good nor bad. I don\u0027t consider any interest, even special ones, communicating their ideas a bad thing. To deny advocacy is to deny the concept of free speech itself, and this is regardless of whomever the speaker is.\n\nI say this in that speakers don\u0027t automatically cause people to agree with them. You aren\u0027t some idiot who never heard of anything before. People willing to go out and vote usually have their minds made up long before the first ad hits. Elections are increasingly about getting your already-secure base to the polls in numbers bigger than the other side is.\n\n\u0026gt; Advertising works, and political ads are advertising\n\nIt disappoints me that you believe this is true. It\u0027s becoming increasingly apparent that ads are increasingly of limited utility compared to other GOTV efforts.\n\nAs another redditor once eloquently put it, a TV is not a magic box that makes you do things against your will.\n\n\u0026gt;  and the legislative process\n\nI have no problem with lobbying in principle, as I suspect you don\u0027t, either. Proper enforcement to prevent quid-pro-quo prevents corruption, no matter the amount of lobbying that takes place.\n\n\u0026gt; New media seems to have a weird way of taking off in unexpected directions\n\nI was speaking more metaphorically. The idea that you can drown out someone\u0027s message with a louder message doesn\u0027t hold up, because there\u0027s infinite ways to communicate ideas. If you want a concrete example, let\u0027s look at the 1994 midterm elections. Think back to 20 years ago, if you can remember back that far: The internet was barely getting started, and mainstream news outlets were supportive of Clinton\u0027s crime bill, which included an Assault Weapon Bans. Big Business supported the ban, Big Media did, Big Government did, and the polls shows that even the public did too. It should have been a slam-dunk for the Democrats to retain the House.\n\nGun owners were denied access to the influence powers that the Big X\u0027s had. So they organized- they used a low-level ground game that organized around gun stores to turn the 1994 election into a wipeout. They were denied influence across the spectrum, but pulled it off in an actual election.\n\nA more recent case: Romney and his allied groups outself Obama in 2012, but Obama still won. Why? Elections are more than a factor of money. Romney had all the charisma of a wooden spoon in blue jeans, and all the money in the world wouldn\u0027t win the election for him.\n\n\u0026gt; but it is obvious that large corporations, industry, and the wealthy have more sway over what happens in politics than regular people, and I believe that it is completely out of scale.\n\nThis has *always* been the case. In every society throughout history. It\u0027s what\u0027s known as the \"Elites.\" You can\u0027t ever get rid of them. Even if you stage a bloody revolution and kill them all, a new group instantly takes their place.  It\u0027s the nature of government and humanity for some to have more influence than others.\n\nIs ours out of \"sync\" historically? I doubt it. I can\u0027t think of any point of time where \"elites\" were put on the back burner. The closest we came was the New Deal, but even then, special interests in the New Deal Coalition were driving the agenda.\n\n\u0026gt; I am arguing about proportion; the line has to be drawn somewhere, I personally think we are beyond what people should accept. Others might think that this line is far off in the distance.\n\nAnd I argue that there can be no line if we still want to call it free speech- because it\u0027s not free anymore. Government stepping in and deciding which speech we want to limit (or ban) is a bad, *bad* idea. The law that was struck down in *Citizens United*, the BCRA, was used as a club to beat conservatives such that liberal voices stayed dominant. There\u0027s every indication that should *CU* be overturned that it would happen again.\n\nI think the Supreme Court said it more eloquently than I can, in *Buckley v Valeo*:\n\n\u0026gt;The concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment, which was designed \u0027to secure \"the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources...\n\nBefore you reply, please read some of Freakonomic\u0027s take on campaign finance from which I based my reply:\n\n[How Much Does Campaign Spending Influence the Election?](http://freakonomics.com/2012/01/17/how-much-does-campaign-spending-influence-the-election-a-freakonomics-quorum/)\n\n[Does Money Really Buy Elections?](http://freakonomics.com/2012/01/12/does-money-really-buy-elections-a-new-marketplace-podcast/)\n\n[Does Campaign Spending Matter?

I don\u0027t know of a specific case of a PAC or anything buying up all the ad time, but do you catch my drift? I can vote, talk to my family and friends, even run for office, but my influence is limited to a human scale, while a PAC or lobby group has influence over legislation, elections, etc. on a scale that is hard to imagine. Sure, if everybody went out and voted together the cumulative effect would be \u0027the will of the people\u0027, but you can\u0027t really argue that special interests do not distort elections and the legislative process, or even influence \u0027the will of the people\u0027.
