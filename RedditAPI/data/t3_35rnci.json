You had ballplayers see their head sizes shoot up in their 30s. Look at Barry Bonds, his head got so big the baseball cap company literally doesn\u0027t have hates his size anymore. Ballplayers were coming out left and right talking about how steroids were infiltrating baseball, a player actually went on sports illustrated to publish an article on it.

Trying to get in as many sexist quotes as the head of the sport before the world cup this summer to set some sort of record maybe? People just don\u0027t do corrupt things for the hell of it. They are compensated. He even published a phony corruption paper that he forged about the whole thing. \n\nWhat rock do you live under, and are there teams there that are any good outside of Fifa\u0027s tyrany? That seems like a nice place to exist if not for the fact that it\u0027s imaginary.

It rakes in billions of tax free revenue, which it then uses to legally bribe smaller countries to guarantee votes.  How does it achieve this?  By dressing it at aid to develop the game.  It sends out hundreds of millions every year to small, developing nations to help with infrastructure, development, etc.    All this aid is receibed and managed by these countries FA\u0027s, which like every FA is as crooked as they come, and who then proceed to funnel it to pet projects managed by lackies or family members who kick back to them.   In return FIFA gets unwavering loyalty and Blatter a huge, grateful voting pool to do his bidding.  \n\nIt\u0027s bloody brilliant, HYDRA/SPECTER level shit.  FIFA doesn\u0027t even  have to gets its hands dirty.  If any corruption is dug up, all it has to do is clutch it\u0027s pearls and pretend they knew nothing of it, which legally they don\u0027t, so they are scott free.  \n\nThe most Blatter can face from the FBI is a subpena to give a deposition.  What they are investigating is not even related to FIFA, but to Jack Warner, CONCACAF, and Mohamed bin Hanamman.   It will be embarrassing, but as he is a native Swiss working for an organization based on Switzerland, the chances the Swiss government actually doing anything the FBI or US government ask of them about Blatter will fall on deaf ears.
