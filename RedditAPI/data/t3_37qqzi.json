This gives Blatter huge support around most of the world. The African and Asian countries basically voted as a giant bloc in support of Blatter. Countries like Canada and the U.S. also usually vote for Blatter but this time they decided to take a moral stand against him. Another thing that works in Blatters favour is that under his rule, countries that normally would not get to host the World Cup have been given a fairer opportunity. for the first time a World Cup has been hosted in both Asia and Africa. Countries that have benefited from this are also more likely to support Blatter... especially  Russia and Qatar.\nEdit: fixed a couple of spelling errors.","duration":"","id":65,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_crp4uef","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Sepp Blatter re-elected as Fifa president after Prince Ali Bin al-Hussein concedes defeat","label":"ehimcanadian","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_37qqzi","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.43294874E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.432955266E9,"simScore":0.7862976799574491,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":66,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"notdwaynejohnson","label":"Will the investigation and the following FBI and Swiss raid be a new feature in the next FIFA video game?\n\n\"Hmm, do I want to be Real Madrid or the feds?\"","duration":"","id":66,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_crp5i4e","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Sepp Blatter re-elected as Fifa president after Prince Ali Bin al-Hussein concedes defeat","label":"ehimcanadian","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_37qqzi","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.43294874E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.432956249E9,"simScore":0.6967132848042707,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":67,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"dakunism","label":"My goodness.

For a LONG time, UEFA had a severely corrupt stranglehold on FIFA and basically ignored North/Central America, Africa, Asia and Oceania. It wasn\u0027t until the 1982 world cup expansion to 24 teams in which North/Central America, African and Asia allocated more than 1 spot each while UEFA took at least 50% of the allocated spots (heck, some years Africa and Oceania got ZERO). Even in 1982, despite NA/Asia/Africa getting one more spot each, UEFA adds 5 more spots of their own. It wasn\u0027t until the 1998 world cup in which Africa, Asia and North America got a better allocation.\n\nYear | N America | Africa | Asia | Oceania | S America | Europe |  Total\n-----|--------------|--------|--------|---------|-------------|---------|------\n1950 | 2 | 0 | 1 | (Asia) | 5^H | 7^C | 16\n1954 | 1 | 0 | 1 | (Asia) | 2^C | 12^H | 16\n1958 | 1 | (Asia) | 1^a | (Asia) | 3 | 11^a+H+C | 16\n1962 | 0.5^b | 0.5^b | 0.5^b | (Asia) | 5.5^b+H+C | 8 + 2*0.5^b | 16\n1666 | 1 | (Asia) | 1 | (Asia) | 4^C | 10^H | 16\n1970 | 2^H | 1 | 1 | (Asia) | 3 | 9^C | 16\n1974 | 1 | 1 | 1 | (Asia) | 3.5^C | 9.5^H | 16 \n1978 | 1 | 1 | 1 | (Asia) | 3.5^H | 9.5^C | 16\n1982 | 2 | 2 | 2 | (Asia) | 4^C | 14^H | 24\n1986 | 2^H | 2 | 2 | 0.5 | 4 | 13.5^C | 24\n1990 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0.5 | 3.5^C | 14^H | 24\n1994 | 2.25^c+H | 3 | 2 | 0.25^c | 3.5^c | 13^C | 24\n1998 | 3 | 5 | 3.5 | 0.5 | 5^C  | 15^H | 32\n2002 | 3 | 5 | 4.5^d+H | 0.5 | 4.5 | 14.5^C | 32\n2006^e | 3.5 | 5 | 4.5 | 0.5 | 4.5 | 14^H | 32\n2010 | 3.5 | 6^H | 4.5 | 0.5 | 4.5 | 13 | 32\n2014 | 3.5 | 5 | 4.5 | 0.5 | 5.5^H | 13 | 32\n\n_.25, _0.5: a final intercontinental playoff is involved  \n^H : Continent hosted the World Cup  \n^C : Continent had the defending champion    \n^a : Israel escaped Asia despite never actually recording a full match out of other nations protested.

Wales ended up qualifying for the World Cup over Israel.  \n^b : the Asian and African champions were placed against European opposition in playoffs and lost. the North American champion played South American opposition in the playoffs but at least won  \n^c : An intercontinental playoff between the North American runner-up and Oceania winner (Canada vs Australia) was to play in an intercontinental playoff against a South American runner up (Argentina). Argentina proceeded to qualify  \n^d : Korea and Japan co-hosted the tournament.  \n^e : as of the 2006 world cup, the defending champion no longer automatically qualifies for it\n\nAND: before saying \"why doesn\u0027t South America have more spots if the others increased their allocation?\", its because their qualifying pool is only 10 nations. in the 2014 world cup, they qualified 60% of their teams for it.\n\nTL;DR: Asia, Africa and North/Central America were not fairly represented in the World Cup until 1998, when Blatter came into charge.

average sports executive prince ali bin alhussein is the brother of king abdullah of jordan and a sandhursttrained former special forces officer whose speciality was freefall parachute jumps according to hashemite tradition he is the rd generation direct descendant of the prophet muhammad those supercharged establishment credentials notwithstanding prince ali is also seen as the reformist candidate and not just because he is taking on a yearold man who has been in fifas top job for  years ali is  years blatters junior and is the organisations youngest vicepresident as well as the youngest of the

beaumont has more on the palestinian motion to have israel suspended from fifa with the vote to come in the next couple of hours or so it looks as though it will go down to the wire as we reported this morning there is an agreement on compromise issues on four of the main points in the palestinian complaint israel has offered laissez passers for palestinian footballers to help develop palestinian pitches and to set up a mechanism for disagreements where there is still no agreement  and the deal breaker for both sides  is on the issue of five settlement football teams based in the occupied territories the palestinian fa wants them suspended and israel says this isnt going to happen the suggested fifa compromise is that this is parked at the un which then decides on the issue israel is not keen on this at all since the likely ruling in line with international law is that the teams are based in illegal settlements in land under occupation all that blatter has done for now is pushing the issue further along the agenda in the hope of buying a couple more hours for a deal my sources on the palestinian delegation have been pretty consistent on this issue today and for the preceding weeks that doesnt mean there wont necessarily be a fudge in the end but it is going to go right up to any vote by the looks of it pm aest big dave cameron has again called for sepp blatter

take place or the agenda may be changed today i am appealing to unity and a team spirit so we can move forward together it may not always be easy but it is this reason that we are here today we are here to solve these problems this may not happen in one day but we are starting and we will do it with the members of the national associations because you are the ambassadors of our football you have the power to change the face of fifa you have the power in your hearts a power you can not buy on the markets lets get down to work let us not just talk about problems let us go and solve them let us move forward the important point is transparency the important point is where is our football where does fifa stand in the world it is the fight against corruption match fixing and racism  which we still have in our game and it hurts we will naturally talk about development but that all belongs together we have a chance to create unity we will have the possibility to play and to apply the handshake for peace and this will be under item  on the agenda we have a problem to solve we should find a solution which will finally satisfy i like would like to hold this congress under fifas

pictwittercomjupegvtcm pm aest hello lawrence ostlere here to take the helm for a while and the first thing to report is that fifa have postponed todays postvote press conference until tomorrow meaning the winner will not face the media today pm aest former south african president thabo mbeki has denied that any public money was used to bribe fifa officials in his countrys bid for the  world cup in a statement mbeki said as former president of the republic of south africa i have noted reports alleging that bribes were solicited and paid to some officials of the fdration internationale de football association fifa in exchange for our country to host the  soccer world cup i am not aware of anybody who solicited a bribe from the government for the purpose of our country being awarded the right to host the world cup as minister of sport and recreation fikile mbalula has stated on behalf of the government no public money was ever used to pay a bribe i wish to state that the government that i had the privilege to lead would never have paid any bribe even if it were solicited mbeki was president from  to  and played a prominent role in campaigning for south africa to win the world cup bid  the first country on the african continent to host the tournament pm aest english fa chairman greg dyke has backed the idea of a coordinated european boycott of the world cup in russia in  he told the bbc radio  today programme ive taken the quotes from press association what there is no point in is one or two countries saying were not going to take part because they will carry on with the tournament without them and that is pretty unfair on the fans but if uefa as a group said look unless you get this sorted we are not going to be in the world cup then i think that we would join them he made similar comments to sky sports news saying there would be no point pulling england out if everyone else stays in it would have no impact it would just be forgotten but if you could pull uefa out that might have an impact if blatter gets reelected then that should be discussed i thought the evidence the americans produced was devastating and i dont think blatter can survive that he might survive this weekend but i dont think he can survive in the long term during his period in charge the level of corruption has been unacceptable its just frightening of sepp blatters chances in todays vote dyke said to radio  i hope he doesnt win but if he does i think the events of this week have turned him into a diminished figure and i cant see him lasting more than a year or two mr blatters statement yesterday in which he basically said leave it to me i will clean it up  nobody is going to believe that and i think it is quite ominous for him when the attorney general in america says this is only the beginning not the end updated at pm aest pm aest aside from the presidential election fifa congress will also today tackle a call by the palestinian football association for a vote demanding the suspension of israel from the world football organisation the guardians jerusalem correspondent peter beaumont reports despite lastditch attempts at mediation by world football officials

arba bikat hayarden and givat zeev which play in israels lower divisions compromise is possible on issues like movement of palestinian players and equipment if a mechanism can be agreed a member of the palestinian delegation told the guardian but no compromise is possible on the settlement teams continued playing in israels league the comments came as it appeared that the palestinian vote might require less than the widely reported  of the  member delegations to back israels suspension palestinian officials believe that  in the first instance  they require only a straight majority under fifa rules with  being required to ratify and renew a suspension if the vote does takes place it will be a secret ballot fifa officials have previously insisted a  majority was required you can read the
