Inmarsat also shared the same information with British security and air-safety officials on Wednesday, according to two of the people, who were briefed on the investigation.\n\n\u0026gt; Two additional people familiar with the Malaysian side of the probe said the information could have arrived in Kuala Lumpur as late as the morning of March 13.\n\n\u0026gt; Malaysia\u0027s government, concerned about corroborating the data and dealing with internal disagreements about how much information to release, didn\u0027t publicly acknowledge Inmarsat\u0027s information until March 15, during a news conference with Prime Minister Najib Razak. Malaysia began to redirect the search effort that day to focus on the areas the information described, and said for the first time that deliberate actions were involved in the plane\u0027s disappearance.","duration":"","id":58,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_cgjo4mu","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":57,"links":[56],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"mh_mystery_throwaway","label":"Like it in principle, but try hard to find a good source and it\u0027s on the list...","duration":"","id":57,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cgjnw8w","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":56,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"captainhaddock","label":"There was a report in a reputable paper (but I forget which, maybe WSJ or Guardian) that the Malaysian authorities knew about the satellite ping data on the 12th, but did not divert search and rescue resources to the Indian Ocean until several days later.

Data from the JORN sites is fed to the JORN Coordination Centre at RAAF Base Edinburgh where it is passed on to other agencies and military units. Officially the system allows the Australian Defence Force to observe all air and sea activity north of Australia to distances of 3000 km. This encompasses all of Java, Irian Jaya, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, and halfway across the Indian Ocean. Other sources put the range at 4000 km from the Australian coastline,[23] as far away as Singapore.[24]\n\nThe JORN is so sensitive it is able to track planes as small as a Cessna 172 taking off and landing in East Timor 2600 km away. Current research is anticipated to increase its sensitivity by a factor of ten beyond this level.
