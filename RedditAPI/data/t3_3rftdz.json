Furthermore, the materials were sold by *private* entities with the understanding that they\u0027d be used for research and industrial purposes.\n\nFor example, as the article mentions, Iraq received bacillus anthracis, among other biological cultures. Such exchanges were made by research organizations like American Type Culture Collection and Iraq\u0027s Ministry of Health, drug organizations, biology and microbiology departments at various universities, and Iraq\u0027s Atomic Energy Commission. Again, all of these biological shipments were intended for research purposes, and many were approved by the Department of Commerce and overseen by the CDC. This is the case with industrial dual-use material as well. The article mentions that the US provided \"chemical warfare agent production facility plans and technical drawings.\" But, if you look at the full Congressional Report this is cited from, the technical drawings were for a pesticide facility. \n\nI want to emphasize that I\u0027m not excusing the apparent negligence in allowing Iraq to obtain materials that can be used in biological and chemical weaponry. Simply pointing out that these consequences were unintended. . \n\nAnother relevant passage from the Congressional Report: \n\n\u0026gt;During the earlier years associated with Iraq\u0027s build-up of its scientific, industrial \nand military capabilities, Iraq was neither a proscribed nation to be denied military \ncritical technology, nor an enemy. The U.S. intelligence community is forbidden from \nmonitoring the activities of U.S. citizens and U.S. companies. Consequently, very little \nwas known by the Intelligence Community about U.S. exports of technology with \nmilitary potential, particularly to a non-proscribed non-enemy nation, unless it was \ninformed of such exports by the Department of Commerce. During 1980-1994, the \nDepartment of Commerce requested that DoD review only 16 dual-use export cases. Of \nthese, only two were forwarded to the DIA for technical review. They involved \ncomputers and signal processing equipment. DIA recommended denial in both cases. \nDIA was aware of the illegal export of thiodiglycol to Iraq by the Baltimore company \nAlcolac. DIA assisted customs and the FBI in their investigation and successful \nprosecution of that company. \n\nhttp://www.archive.org/stream/unitedstatesdual00unit/unitedstatesdual00unit_djvu.txt\nhttp://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/uslikelysentiraqbugs.html\n\nAll of the other links you provided essentially make the same points... \n","duration":"","id":27,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_cwoimeh","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":26,"links":[25],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"rdinsb","label":"I think we did:   \n\nhttp://rense.com/general29/wesold.htm   \n\nhttp://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/10/bush-censored-discovery-chemical-weapons-iraq.html   \n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2013/09/04/history-lesson-when-the-united-states-looked-the-other-way-on-chemical-weapons/   \n\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/iraq/stories/wartech091790.htm   \n\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-and-iraq-go-way-back/   \n\nEdit: Formatting","duration":"","id":26,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cwocban","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":25,"links":[18],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"FormlessCarrot","label":"We didn\u0027t actually sell Iraq chemical or biological weapons.

They are joined by British forces. Their mission is to attack Iraq\u0027s nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs and its military capacity to threaten its neighbors.\n\n\u0026gt;Their purpose is to protect the national interest of the United States, and indeed the interests of people throughout the Middle East and around the world.\n\n\u0026gt;**Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors or the world with nuclear arms, poison gas or biological weapons.**\n\n\u0026gt;I want to explain why I have decided, with the unanimous recommendation of my national security team, to use force in Iraq; why we have acted now; and what we aim to accomplish.\n\n\u0026gt;Six weeks ago, Saddam Hussein announced that he would no longer cooperate with the United Nations weapons inspectors called UNSCOM. They are highly professional experts from dozens of countries. Their job is to oversee the elimination of Iraq\u0027s capability to retain, create and use weapons of mass destruction, and to verify that Iraq does not attempt to rebuild that capability.\n\nRead the entire thing. This is why Bill Clinton has always supported the invasion of Iraq - even if he had critiques like all the other Monday morning generals.\n\nAlso ask your self and others why General Clapper, Obama\u0027s head of national security, said that the WMDs were moved into Syria in the run up to the war.\n\nhttp://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-10-29/news/0310290219_1_illicit-weapons-clapper-weapons-inspector\n\n\u0026gt;WASHINGTON — The director of a top U.S. spy agency said Tuesday that he believes that material from Iraq\u0027s illicit weapons program had been transported into Syria and perhaps other countries as part of an effort by the Iraqis to disperse and destroy evidence immediately before the recent war.\n\n\u0026gt;The official, James Clapper Jr., a retired lieutenant general, said satellite imagery showing a heavy flow of traffic from Iraq into Syria, just before the U.S. invasion in March, led him to believe that illicit weapons material \"unquestionably\" had been moved out of Iraq.\n\nThat isn\u0027t some kook, it\u0027s the guy Obama hired to be the director of intelligence in 09!

He kicked the inspectors out in 1998, and was bombed by the USA and Britain in response (the USA continued to bomb Iraq daily for years after 1998). The weapons inspectors were allowed back in prior to the US invasion. There were reports of the inspectors being harassed, but for the most part Iraq was compliant, especially compared to its past behavior. Inspectors were let in unconditionally by Iraq, so there was no nuance.\n\nHere is a decent summary of events:  \nhttp://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId\u003d4996218\n\nWhy Saddam acted in a way like he was trying to hide something, when in fact the country was completely bankrupt and he had no weapons programs at all, people can only speculate. Considering Saddam was extremely paranoid and didn\u0027t even let his army train with live ammo because of fear of a coup, I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if his goal was to make other countries think he may actually have WMD\u0027s, believing that would ward off an invasion. \n\nIn the end, it didn\u0027t appear to matter, as the US made the decision to invade even as evidence mounted against Iraq having a WMD program. The argument behind the invasion was to dismantle said WMD program, yet as it became clearer and clearer the program was a phantom, the invasion was suddenly unleashed. It was clear the premise for the invasion was completely false and had been solely politically motivated. I should also point out that several members of Bush\u0027s cabinet had been pushing for an invasion of Iraq for years, even sending a letter to then President Clinton urging him to attack. Clinton replied he was busy combating Al Qaeda and that intelligence showed Iraq to not be a threat.\n\nHere is the letter sent to Clinton in 1998:  \nhttp://zfacts.com/metaPage/lib/98-Rumsfeld-Iraq.pdf\n\nTake notice of the names signed at the bottom. 10 of the 18 signatories later served in the Bush Administration.","duration":"","id":76,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cwqjeux","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":75,"links":[72],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"DeHominisDignitate","label":"If my memory serves, wasn\u0027t Saddam immensely resistant to letting people in?
