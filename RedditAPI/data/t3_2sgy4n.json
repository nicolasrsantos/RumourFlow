The people who can actually afford to protest, or strike, or even entertain taking time off to go vote for someone to represent their interests, are the people who already have good jobs, money, and time off. And if you meant something more violent, well, it also takes time and money to own a gun (or have any practice with it), and all that would do is make you an easier target for a drone strike.\n\nGood jobs do exist here. I have one.

Well, I try to, but there are so many people less fortunate than I that I could focus on, and it seems so futile when even *my* vote is going to be [gerrymandered](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering) into oblivion, because I\u0027m going to vote for one of the two parties that our first-past-the-post system mathematically guarantees.

Even if they fire you for showing up late they still need to show, in most states, that they verbally warned you, gave you a written warning and the employee must sign.\n\nSource: Have had to pay unemployment benefits to people who showed up to work naked, smeared shit on the bathroom walls and showed up late (30 minutes ~ 1 hour) every day for 30 days. Not all of these examples are different people either!\n\nQuitting? You can get benefits for quitting depending on the circumstance.

The prevailing view of many American employers is that profit is only achieved by reducing cost as opposed to, say, increasing production and expanding markets. To that end they have pushed for laws that allow them to treat their employees like shit. As a result of the employees being unhappy and feeling disconnected from their company, the per-employee productivity drops substantially. A lot of businesses continue slashing \"expenses\" without realizing that the \"expenses\" that they are slashing are means of production.\n\n It\u0027s analogous to a situation where a farmer decides that he\u0027d rather use a scythe to harvest wheat instead of a combine because the combine would increase his expenses. Sure, the equipment is expensive but that expense is outpaced by the productivity gains. \n\nI had an interesting conversation with the president of the small company I work for. He was complaining that some of the members (we\u0027re a PLLC so that\u0027s analogous to \"shareholders-or partners\") had taken the time to add up the expense of providing free sodas and juice in the break room, and were questioning the wisdom of that practice. The president responded to these concerns by pointing out that their savings estimate was around $1,500 dollars annually and the time it took to come up with that figure and hold a meeting about it wasted over triple that amount in billable time. He added to this analysis the fact that some of the employees are diabetic, and providing orange juice is only a humane accommodation and one that is reasonably calculated to increase productivity (as opposed to requiring diabetic employees to languish in low blood sugar). \n\nTLDR: Current corporate culture in America is spiraling into a state where \"expense cutting\" is actually destroying productivity.

This year he took it all in one go, he just went back to work this week. Our daughter is lost without him home. :(\n\nEdit: He\u0027s a welder. He works 6 months of the year repairing boats, 6 months of the year night shift on emergancy repair where he basically sits in their \"welding shack\" with his laptop playing video games. He works at the top plant so he gets some nice bonuses year round. The one that just came in was $1500 for a christmas bonus. Before that was $800 thanksgiving bonus. Next is either cleanest yard or top plant. Idk which. Every year the workers get a raise, $0.40 is the standard raise, but better performance gets it bumped up higher. We love his job though, the health insurance is amazing. 20/80, $500 deductible, which was a lot better than his old job. Also they get fed all the time. The night shift crew tends to fish in the slip and then theh grill their catches, in the winter during repair they all bring one item to work out of the meal they will be serving and its cooked by one of the workers. Right now though they are just getting into the rush period so no one is cooking as far as I\u0027m hearing since my husband just left for work after raiding the shit out of our fridge.Thing is around here people around our age say they would never work where he works because of the fish smell, but all the older people know that the company is excellent to their employees and tell him to stay there for as long as possible.

Social security and any of the programs we have that redistribute wealth are socialist because it means that every company that pays taxes is partially owned by the body politic.\n\nThat\u0027s why you shouldn\u0027t cringe when \"socialist\" comes up in the context of American political discourse. Almost nobody is saying that we should be a purely socialist society.

I am an unemployed, depressed, lonely fucking loser.  I am worth my vote, which is a drop in bucket.  I lack the motivation (and lets face it, charisma and status) to organize voters in my area.  Even if I did, I would be fighting against not other voters, but the money that drives political campaigns.  Campaigns are won by marketing, which is what this sick leave proposal amounts to.  A politicians boss is the votes that keep him in office, which is often that money more than anything else.\n\nBeing a politician shouldn\u0027t be a job.  It should be a service.  They should receive benefits similar to low level military recruits, they should serve temporary terms, and they should absolutely be held to extremely specific and extremely harsh guidelines concerning compensation.  My views on this would be very unpopular with politicians.\n\nBeing a representative should be a sacrifice, not a career.  One should not aspire to politics, but be called to action for the greater good.  Put them on a near minimum wage salary for their district, with the same health insurance provided to their constituents by the government for that pay range.  Nobody should want to be a politician for longer than they have to be.  Get in, get the job done, get out.  We don\u0027t need people sitting in an office that depend on being desired for the difference they will make *next term.*  That\u0027s no motivation to get things done.  \"I would have passed the laws we sorely needed, but there are too many (insert rival party here), we\u0027ll get them next time guys!  Just remember to vote for me!\"\n\nA career politician is the same to me as a person joining the military (or police force) because they want to shoot people.  They are sick.  Career politics is a job in marketing.  It is being a professional job applicant.  All it takes is answering the right questions with the right half-truths, or more likely lies.\n\nTL;DR - It\u0027s close to when I fall asleep, which is when my posting inhibition shuts off and I go a little nuts.  I know my ideas a far from perfect, but dammit, the system as is feels nearly dystopian.  The united states isn\u0027t the worst place to live.  It just feels like, some day, if we try hard enough, it will be.\n\nTL;DR for the tldr - Sorry, I accidentally too many words.

Some of us get 33+ days.  \n\nI get the liberal side of things - it should be a right, low paid workers can\u0027t take the hits and yet they\u0027re the ones with no benefits, huge corporations cheat the system as best they can to avoid paying more than they have to.  I get it.  \n\nOn the other hand, profit margins are actually pretty thin.  Distributing CEO bonuses only gets the workers a few bucks a piece at the end of the year; it\u0027s not so simple as tearing down the fat cats and giving the workers more.  Raise wages or benefits and you\u0027ll see prices go up, for better or for worse.  \n\nAdditionally, there are motivating factors beyond simple cost.  No one wants to talk about how flaky certain wage workers can be.  In my company, as I stated, we get 30+ days off for sick leave.  Beyond that, all you need is a doc\u0027s note and we\u0027ll put you on short term disability with 80% pay for a whole year.  Do you know how many sick days most of my employees take each year?  Average is below 2 days for the child-free ones, less than two weeks for those with families.  That\u0027s not a mandate; management doesn\u0027t judge based on the number, there\u0027s no impact on career success - people want to work, want to excel, and can\u0027t see the value in not showing up when they\u0027ll just miss meetings and fall behind.  They work to build their careers and taking a year or even a day off hurts their personal development and project progress. \n\nHow many of those 33 sick days would a wage worker at McBurgertown take?  That\u0027s a whole month off, \"unpunished\" if you want to look at it that way.  Furthermore, when running shift work, you schedule the number of people you need and no more.  When one doesn\u0027t show up, that\u0027s a pain in the ass.  \n\nIn reality, those \"point\" systems are rarely taken literally.  If you\u0027re sick for a week but you\u0027re a good worker, you\u0027ll be just fine.  If you\u0027re a pain in the ass and you don\u0027t show up once every two weeks for your shift, you\u0027re out.  It\u0027s a rationalization system for eliminating crappy workers, even if it is unfortunately co-opted by petty managers in some places. \n\nSpeaking from upper middle class though, I\u0027m probably not qualified to remember how wage work goes.  It\u0027s been 15 years since I had to clock in; what would I know?

Hardly anyone has any basic grip of economics and repeats whatever they have been told. Much of what gets repeated are either lies or basic economic theories that have largely been proven wrong. Most of these theories work really well in perfect world scenarios which are far from how things truly are in the real world. The amount of people who blissfully repeat these concept without any thought or basic understanding of economics is staggering.\nI am not some Harvard economics major just a normal every day person who has lived and worked in the real world. I learned everything I know beyond the basics of economics from self-study of materials found on the internet. Everything from studies to wikipedia has given me the knowledge to understand a lot of how things function. \n\n\nRecently workers rights things like pay, paid days off, paid maternity leave, and paid holidays has been coming up quite a bit in politics and for good reason. Here in the US we are so far away from other fully developed nations that our work polices and conditions are closer to China\u0027s than a place like Norway or Sweden. It seems like every time workers make the push for living wages or things like paid sick days we get a push back from. conservatives who largely seem bought and sold by the large corporations. Often times they say it is to protect jobs because apparently treating employees like people is bad for the job market. Talking about the economy and economics you hear statements like this ad nauseum even though evidence based off of many other countries contradicts these. \n\n\nThe truth is as long as demand exist here in the US companies will come here to fill these demands in order to profit. It is elementary economics. If money can be made it will. Giving maternity leave isn\u0027t going to force companies to leave the US. Giving sick days off isn\u0027t going to force even small businesses out of the fray. Sure these companies aren\u0027t going to like the .5% profits they will give up for these small changes, but they can deal with it or leave. Let them stomp their feet like little children. Someone looking for profit will fill in the gap and they will be damn well happy to treat workers fairly.\t\n\t","duration":"","id":1443,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cnpmezm","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Obama to propose paid sick leave for American workers","label":"zmekus","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_2sgy4n","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.421316135E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.421339818E9,"simScore":0.6546716345293276,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":1444,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"jiveabillion","label":"How about paid maternity leave?","duration":"","id":1444,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cnpmiqs","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Obama to propose paid sick leave for American workers","label":"zmekus","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_2sgy4n","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.421316135E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.421340295E9,"simScore":0.4411607086658478,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},{"index":1445,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"troypolidori","label":"Adjunct College Professor in the US here.

After 3 years, it goes up to 6 hours per pay period.  After 15 years, you get 8 hours a pay period, which means you get 26 days off a year.  That\u0027s on top of federal holidays.
