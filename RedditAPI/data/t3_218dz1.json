His rendition most certainly began in Malaysia at Kuala Lumpur as officials there held him and his wife for TWO WEEKS before telling them to travel to the UK, where they would knowingly be intercepted by US officials in Beijing.  What I should have highlighted more is the cooperation between the United States/UK and Malaysia during this operation.  Something that is relevant to me when thinking about this plane and its disappearance.  \n\n4 - You are again understating the importance of Diego Garcia.  Diego Garcia is like our Guantanamo in the Pacific.  Literally described as a legal black hole: \"The US and UK governments have evaded accountability by way of a persistent black hole strategy, contending that some national laws and international treaties for the protection of human rights and the environment do not apply to the island.\"  You can see the military funding [here](http://www.your-poc.com/remote-sites-diego-garcia-british-indian-ocean/), you know, $90 million for \"various repairs.\"\n\nAs for your final point, I think what makes this most suspicious to me, is the response of the Malaysian Airlines.  It\u0027s almost as if they didn\u0027t care or want anyone else to care what was happening to this plane.  They were informed of its diversion almost IMMEDIATELY by Vietnam, and what was there response?    \n\nMy point with Abdel Hakim is that the US and Malaysia have a history of collaborating to break international law.  And the dates, I was thinking hijacker motive when I made my timeline.  \n\nJust do not underestimate the effect that the Deal in the Desert had on the current political landscape, i.e. \"[how the US, with the UK and others, largely gets away with running a global system of secret prisons and abductions](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/12/dark-side-deal-desert-20131216125913526974.html),\" to regime change in Libya \u0026amp; the Benghazi affair.
