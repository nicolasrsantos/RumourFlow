You accept the fact that the government can totally affect markets, you want the government to affect the labor market through policy that you think will encourage higher wages and better benefits. So how can you ignore the housing policies of the federal Government? The Clinton and Bush administrations pushed for higher home ownership rate of lower income demographics, and they sued the banks that didn\u0027t do it. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan wanted to drastically increase a home ownership to stimulate the economy after the dot com bubble burst. These regulators are retarded and their efforts harm average Americans. That\u0027s why we need *limited* regulations and power over the economy.

Everyone can afford a higher standard of living *because* of international trade, not despite of it. \n\nThe US is still the second largest manufacturer in the world. Our economy is not taking because of free trade. \n\n\u0026gt;Look at the recession of 2008. I feel like it could have been avoided with proper regulation.\n\nAgain, I\u0027m not advocating for total lack of regulation. But you are ignoring the role of the largest organizations involved in the financial market: the Federal Reserve and the Federal government. You accept the fact that the government can totally affect markets, you want the government to affect the labor market through policy that you think will encourage higher wages and better benefits. So how can you ignore the housing policies of the federal Government? The Clinton and Bush administrations pushed for higher home ownership rate of lower income demographics, and they sued the banks that didn\u0027t do it. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan wanted to drastically increase a home ownership to stimulate the economy after the dot com bubble burst. These regulators are retarded and their efforts harm average Americans. That\u0027s why we need *limited* regulations and power over the economy. The unintended consequences of massive regulation are themselves massive.

Too lazy to vote on issues, will just vote on name.\n\nNow to get everyone angry (even though I don\u0027t mean it offensively), Obama didn\u0027t win because of the name recognition specifically.

Your first point is negated by the living wage referred to in their post.  If you\u0027re guaranteed a minimum wage that would pay median rent in your city plus $50 for food and $50 for saving towards your retirement, for 30 hours work then people won\u0027t need to work more hours (usually) . Some would work more because they want the money or have gotten into financial trouble.  Many would work less because they can.  \n\nYour second point is negated by public health or mandated insurance for all workers.  It\u0027d be cheaper to do a government run system.  \n\nYour third point is true, however the whole purpose of a government is to protect and act on the best interests of the community.  If we as a culture won\u0027t choose to value people over profits it\u0027s up to the government to put the pressure on companies that we refuse to.  \n\nNow I\u0027ll add a little on why it\u0027s so important to make these changes.  \n1) poverty and wealth inequality are one of the strongest forces in stimulating crime and poor health.  Both of these are ridiculously expensive.  Prisons get paid 50-200 000 per head per year.  If we can afford to pay people that much to be locked up surely we can pay them that much to be good citizens? \n2) productivity drops after 30 hours and falls off a cliff after 40 hours a week.  We need to work smarter not harder \n3) having time to be with your family, friends and enjoy time off is important for health and happiness.  It also improves productivity and gives you the time to spend money, stimulating the economy \n4) wealth inequality is bad for the economy.  The more money we can redirect towards the middle and lower classes, the more money that will circulate in the economy \n5) having more spending money and time to spend it will stimulate the growth and creation of novel jobs and industries.  If you believe in capitalism then surely the best way to create jobs is to let people spend money how they want? \n6) the robots are here.  More and more jobs are going to be replaced with automation.  If we don\u0027t make changes to the structure of our economy we\u0027re going to experience another depression as unemployment grows.  Corporations will replace jobs and the rich will pocket the profits.  This will go on until the economy implodes as unemployment rates sore.

You said we should make working 30 hours a week full time.  Right now working 40 hours a week on minimum wage wouldn\u0027t afford you those things.  Reducing the hours required in a system that has already determined working below the threshold is more profitable won\u0027t make them change their mind.  Instead they will just cut the hours back to less than the new number, and people will need three jobs to survive instead of 2.\n\n\u0026gt;Both of these are ridiculously expensive. Prisons get paid 50-200 000 per head per year. If we can afford to pay people that much to be locked up surely we can pay them that much to be good citizens?\n\nBut we won\u0027t.  Many want to reduce welfare, not increase it, and even those that would support increasing it wouldn\u0027t come close to that rate.\n\n\u0026gt;2) productivity drops after 30 hours and falls off a cliff after 40 hours a week. We need to work smarter not harder\n\nWe have a mythos we have created about working harder.  It doesn\u0027t matter that we are working more hours now than we use to.  It doesn\u0027t matter that productivity falls after 40 hours if the company only hires you to work 30 or 20.  You working 3 jobs isn\u0027t their problem, after all you work for them for fewer hours than what makes you less productive and are somewhat easy to replace.\n\n\u0026gt;having time to be with your family, friends and enjoy time off is important for health and happiness. It also improves productivity and gives you the time to spend money, stimulating the economy\n\nAnti-Vaxers\n\nYou know why they have grown in popularity, because so long as everyone else is vaccinated there isn\u0027t a problem.  You as a person or company doing something that gives you an edge only becomes a problem if everyone does it.  They are not looking at everyone doing it, just them, and so long as it is just them, it will make them more money.  Same thing with using the merge lane to get in front of people in traffic.  It gives you an advantage, but slows everyone else down, but so long as only you do it, it will remain advantageous for you to do it.\n\n\u0026gt;wealth inequality is bad for the economy. The more money we can redirect towards the middle and lower classes, the more money that will circulate in the economy \n\nAs a whole, yes.  The thing is the more profitable your company is, the better off your company is.  The more you sifun out of the lower paid employees the more money you have to maintain profitability.  It only becomes problematic if everyone does it, and even then places like Walmart can curtail that through employee discounts to some extent.  Then they can also use government aid to make up the difference between livable wages and what a company pays their employees.  So long as the government doesn\u0027t apply pressure on companies to do what is best for the overall economy, businesses will focus on what is best for themselves.  That is what capitalism is after all.\n\n\u0026gt;having more spending money and time to spend it will stimulate the growth and creation of novel jobs and industries. If you believe in capitalism then surely the best way to create jobs is to let people spend money how they want? \n\nCapitalism is about the accumulation of wealth and left to its own natural devices will always lead to megabusinesses and centralized wealth that eventually collapses in on itself.  No economic system in its pure form, that we have developed, will function in any long term capacity.  We have to combine them in order to have stable growth.  The current trend in the US is to strive towards a more pure capitalistic form.  The trick is to find the balancing point so that the economy doesn\u0027t become a boom and bust economic ride.\n\n\u0026gt;the robots are here. More and more jobs are going to be replaced with automation. If we don\u0027t make changes to the structure of our economy we\u0027re going to experience another depression as unemployment grows. Corporations will replace jobs and the rich will pocket the profits. \n\nWhich will in the end be their downfall.  Much of our failing will come from our own drive for money.  Saudi Arabia has already admitted to the fact that they have no long term plan for once the oil dries up.  The profits being pocketed will go away, simply because everyone thinks they will see the crash before it happens, just like the housing bubble, and most won\u0027t, just like the housing bubble.  We are doomed to repeat history, not because we don\u0027t know it, but because we think we can outsmart it.  We see the profit to be had if we mechanise first, so we will, but fail to grasp that once everyone does there won\u0027t be anyone left to sell stuff to.  \n\n\u0026gt;In short this is a vital question that we as a society need to face before it\u0027s too late\n\nBut we won\u0027t.","duration":"","id":335,"color":"black","redditID":"t1_ct4pw8a","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":334,"links":[333],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"CaptainGulliver","label":"I think you may have missed the point of the post you\u0027re replying to.

Many people work over 40 hours a week, and they need to in order to survive.  The amount of work that needs to be done in many fields exceeds the workforce, but through fear of firing because of a business driven high unemployment has allowed for this to persist.  Basically if minimum wage was a livable wage, and the incentives for part time employment were removed, we would reduce unemployment.  Businesses don\u0027t like this because low unemployment means a more competitive workforce and higher wages, which reduces profitability.\n\n2)  Right now part time employment is used as a workaround for benefits.  This means that reducing the hours that are required to allow people to be considered full time would just decrease the hours they give to part timers.  They would hire more part timers but so long as the wage they pay is unlivable at 40 hours a week, it means that people will need more than one job, which gives the appearance of businesses creating more jobs while also increasing unemployment because more people need multiple jobs to survive.\n\n3)  It is capitalism.  Capitalism puts an emphasis on granting businesses greater power.  Businesses are there to make a profit, and as such, have no drive to improve the life of their employees.  Some do, but it isn\u0027t a requirement, or even in most situations advisable to do that.  This doesn\u0027t make them evil, it just means that their driving force is self preservation as is most things.  Our problem in the US is tied to the desire to allow them to do whatever they want, out of some idea that they know better than the government, which is something the population has influence over, does.

Guess what, the company sees your team is getting all the work done with their current head count and wont urgently look to hire a new person. Want to justify another person in a better way? Work your 40 hour week as a team which means deadlines will slip because we can\u0027t get the work done with our headcount.

Calling it a little much is pathetic.  I have plenty of personal time after working 40 hours, and I make enough and have enough vacation to enable me to do whatever I want.  The goal for all people should be 40 hours.  \n\nSaying you work 37.5 and don\u0027t get paid for work just shows how young you are.  The goal should be 40 hours, everyone should work that and make enough to support themselves.  Once everyone is on the same level then we can focus on working less.\n\nAdditionally, your socialist commie ass isn\u0027t grounded in reality.  Europe is currently going bankrupt because of all of its socialist programs, and the US is not.  I\u0027m not saying socialism is wrong, but it is currently unsustainable.  And an unsustainable system will never be preferable to the American system.  The stories of Americans working 80 hours per week are completely overblown and false, 99.9% of people in America do not work those hours.  99.9% of people in America hardly work more than 50 hours per week, which I agree is already too much.\n\nYou\u0027re attitude towards work is pathetic.  I work in a field that I enjoy, as do many Americans.  I enjoy working extra time when I don\u0027t need to because it allows me to have more money to do what I want in the capitalist system.  And, to add to that, I don\u0027t mind working on something that needs to be completed because I genuinely care about my job.  I guess that doesn\u0027t exist in Europe, but maybe I shouldn\u0027t generalize as much as you.\n\nYou have obviously not worked for very long.

At that time, companies were considered noble and honest and trustworthy (from the picture I get anyway). You worked for a single company your entire life, you relied on that company for retirement and generous benefits that helped you take care of yourself and your family.\n\nEthically, you would (at the time) consider it to be the right thing to do - be a strong, valuable employee. Secure your position, maybe even move up the ladder. \n\nAnd then also remember we weren\u0027t globalized at that point. All you had was a newspaper and propaganda. You had no idea that socialism and communism weren\u0027t the same thing, cause that\u0027s what you were being sold. You had no idea the social policies or cultures of other countries.\n\nThings have changed. We know about how other countries live - we talk to people every day on the internet and learn about them. Our companies have fucked us over, our parents over, maybe even our grandparents. Our benefits are evaporating. The loyalty - both ways - is gone. There is no moving up the ladder anymore.\n\nThat obligation to be a strong employee is gone now. It\u0027s still in our culture, of course.

Well funded from the beginning ($52.3 million raised at this same point in 2007 vs. $15 million for Sanders)\n\n2. Substantially supported by the Dem party (he was encouraged to run by Sen. Harry Reid vs. zero support from the Dem party for Sanders)\n3. Running in a competitive, fractured field that sapped resources and attention away from Clinton, particularly in primary states \n4. A historic candidate (both young and black), with huge support among the black and hispanic communities. Sanders is very old, white, and has virtually no support with those **incredibly** important communities. ([70-80% for Clinton, 9% for Sanders](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/06/30/trumpbushclinton.pdf)) \n5. A moderate (or at least a pragmatist) who appealed to both moderate Democrats and Republicans.\n\nBernie Sanders is the Ron Paul of 2016. He\u0027s got a very vocal base, but no money, no institutional support, and a profile (old, white, man with extreme views) that make him a nonstarter for the vast majority of Americans. The only way he has a shot at the nomination is if Clinton completely implodes due to a scandal and even then Biden or Warren will almost certainly step in to take her place.\n\nIf by some freakish miracle Clinton drops out and Biden or Warren decline to run, and Sanders gets the nomination he will get absolutely destroyed in the general election because 85% of Americans will find something that\u0027s a dealbreaker for them in his platform (and his ***dramatically*** better funded Republican opponents and their enormous billion dollar Super PACS will absolutely *annihilate* his credibility.)\n\nSorry to be so blunt. Bernie Sanders has absolutely no chance in any world that exists in reality to become president.\n\nEDIT: I\u0027m bored at work, so I\u0027m going to continue expanding on why Bernie Sanders will never become president:\n\n1. He\u0027s refused to create a Super PAC. That means he\u0027s going to be financially outgunned 10 to 1 in the Democratic primaries agains Clinton and more like 20 to 1 if he gets the nomination (the network of Super PACs and nonprofits run by the Koch Brothers alone is planning on spending $1 billion in 2016). That means 20x the attack ads. It will be an absolute bloodbath. \n2. He hasn\u0027t run in a competitive election in 20 years. The last competitive election he had was back in 1994 when he ran for his old house seat. And he\u0027s never run a race outside of tiny unique Vermont. The knowledge that comes from running a big, close, brutal in the trenches campaign is invaluable. Clinton\u0027s knowledge of campaigning she got from Bill in the 1990s and from her mudslinging race for senate in 2002 and president in 2008 is going to help her tremendously as she makes life or death political decisions. Bernie Sanders is going to have to make guesses.\n3. Clinton\u0027s campaign has bought every available good political operative in the country. Every single available and experienced media consultant, fundraiser, field director, comm and opposition researcher works for her. Bernie Sanders is left with a 3rd rate staff (no offense to his staff, but they are largely inexperienced or leftover from his previous Vermont campaigns - Manager Jeff Weaver is his old campaign manager for Senate, Field Director Phil Fiermonte is his old state director. Neither know much at all about running nationally). Some of Clinton\u0027s people are lackeys and hangers on, but most are fucking phenomenal at winning elections for Democrats. And her campaign has bought *every single one of them.*\n4. Hilary Clinton, for all the talk about how polarizing she is, is consistently viewed very favorably by Democrats (between 70 and 80% in every poll over the past few years). Her unfavorables are shockingly low for a public figure (below 20%). So Sanders doesn\u0027t just have to pick up all the people who don\u0027t like her already - he has to pick up people who like her too, which is incredibly hard to do. [Compare this with her favorable rating of only 49% back in March 2007.](http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/14/democrats.poll/)\n\nIt goes on and on.

Which means we have to be a lot more productive, workforce participation has to rise from its all-time modern lows. It means that people need to work longer hours and, through their productivity, gain more income for their families. That\u0027s the only way we\u0027re going to get out of this rut that we\u0027re in.\n\nBut that\u0027s where the similarities end. Jeb continues to talk for a while about how he wants a flat tax like in Estonia, and if you actually watch all 45 more minutes of this interview (which I did) you\u0027ll find that the rest of the exchange from this \"transcript\" is not in it. \n\n\nThis section:\n\n\u0026gt;QUESTION: To keep us from taking it out of context, what you meant to say — when you say more hours you mean full-time work.\n\n\u0026gt;BUSH: Given the opportunity to work. Yeah, absolutely.\n\n\u0026gt;QUESTION: Not that a full-time guy or somebody working two jobs needs to be working even more time.\n\n\u0026gt;BUSH: Absolutely not. Their incomes need to grow. It\u0027s not going to grow in an environment where the costs of doing business are so extraordinarily high here. Healthcare costs are rising. In many places the cost of doing business is extraordinarily high, and the net result of that is that business start up rates are at an all-time low. Work-force participation rates are low. If anyone is celebrating this anemic recovery, then they are totally out of touch. The simple fact is people are really struggling. So giving people a chance to work longer hours has got to be part of the answer. If not, you are going to see people lose hope. And that\u0027s where we are today.\n\n**All of that comes from a totally different interview that happened at least 5 hours later, with different reporters, in a different city.** And this was at least 4 hours after the \"longer hours\" quote was already being passed around twitter as a gaffe. He was in damage control mode for the second interview and they mashed two different interviews together to create this fake context to bash liberals for taking the quote out of context. \n\nHere\u0027s a source for the second [interview](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/09/jeb-bush-says-americans-need-to-work-longer-hours-to-earn-more-for-their-families):\n\n\u0026gt;**Bush was asked about the comment by reporters after a town hall event in Hudson.** [an event that started at 6:30 pm, the longer hours gaffe was already a thing on twitter at 3:30 pm] ... If anyone is celebrating this anemic recovery, then they are totally out of touch,” Bush said. “The simple fact is people are really struggling. So giving people a chance to work longer hours has got to be part of the answer. If not, you are going to see people lose hope. And that’s where we are today.\"\n\nSee?

I support facts, but not Bush, so don\u0027t expect me to defend his position. I just want people to have the full picture of what he said.~~\n\n\u0026gt;~~Here is the full exchange. If Bush didn\u0027t clarify his position until days later I would say it was backpedaling but that was not the case.....he clarified his position during the interview but the press conveniently left that part out.  Helps them to create the outrage that lets the sell more papers/get more clicks.~~\n\n\u0026gt;~~BUSH: My aspiration for the country and I believe we can achieve it, is 4% growth as far as the eye can see. Which means we have to be a lot more productive, workforce participation has to rise from its all-time modern lows. It means that people need to work longer hours and, through their productivity, gain more income for their families.

It\u0027s not going to grow in an environment where the costs of doing business are so extraordinarily high here. Healthcare costs are rising.

I read that the avearge Japaense worker takes less vacation than any induslitrazed coutnry. The work culture here is fucking insane. They have sick days and vacation days but people refuse to use sick days. Its \"bad form and rude\". So they feel obligated to use their vacation days first if they get sick. At my first job they expected me to do this. I told them no fucking way. I am sick. I am using a sick day.

With the **massive** increases in productivity that came with the development of computers, the Internet, and other high-tech labor-saving devices, profits skyrocketed, but wages remained stagnant (which, with inflation, actually means they\u0027ve continuously DECLINED). That means all of those gains are going to the owning class (people like, I don\u0027t know, *the Bush family*), while the rest of us (the vast majority) have been forced to work longer and longer hours, *to continue make the same income*. Over the same period that most Europeans\u0027 work hours declined by ~20%, ours **increased** by ~20%. That\u0027s why it\u0027s ABSURDLY insulting for wealthy politicians and business magnates to say stuff like this-- no different from Romney\u0027s \"47%\" line.\n\nAnd at the same time, the tax burden has been shifted heavily onto working people. After FDR, the government got $1.50 in taxes from corporations for every $1.00 that they got from individuals, and the top income tax bracket (the very wealthy) was (were) taxed within the area of 90%. And guess what-- the world didn\u0027t fall apart. Instead, the working class gave rise to a strong, broad middle class (the one capitalism is credited with). Now, for every $1.00 in taxes from individuals, corporations pay $0.25-0.50, and the wealthy make huge tax breaks for themselves, shifting even the burden of personal income taxes onto the (dramatically shrunken) middle class and the (broad, impoverished) working class.\n\nIf you care, you can actually sketch a VERY clear timeline from the pro-labor advancements in the New Deal era through the active, concerted campaign (by corporations and their owners) to undo that progress, which has resulted in the extreme inequality, unrest, and instability that exists today. But why should I write it all out-- an extremely eloquent professor, educated in the Ivy League, with a doctorate in economics has already laid it out in detail, in an easy-to-understand video. So if this comment makes anyone curious, I implore you, listen to this. He\u0027s far more academically qualified to speak on this subject than me (though I do a LOT of personal research and draw many of these statistics from the research of academics like him): \n\nDr. Richard Wolff on \"How the Business Community Screwed the Working Class\"\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v\u003ddHKFoqnc3Hg#\n\nIt\u0027s only 15 minutes, but anyone who enjoys it should check out \"The Game Is Rigged,\" his lecture on the real situation with Greece (in which he gives historical context and explains the reality that the US media has refused to explain), his monthly economic updates (in which he gives his critical perspective on current events and takes questions, updated every month), and, for more theoretical explanation of how and why to criticize capitalism, his two series on Marxian economics (one \"basic\" and one \"advanced and applied\"). All of them are available freely on his YouTube channel. \n\nHe\u0027s the kind of pro-working class, pro-democracy academic (in a similar tradition to that of Noam Chomsky) who we rarely get, but who are utterly invaluable to the struggle against austerity, plutocracy, inverted totalitarianism, and the destruction of our civil liberties. I can\u0027t tell you how much you\u0027ll learn just from watching a few videos of him (or Chomsky for that matter).

The truth is that Jeb Bush and his \"special\" friends are fucking with all of you.

I feel that the nature with this kind of exploitation is that ultimately no matter how \"smart\" the oppressors are they cannot escape the fate of growing too big to maintain control and living standard of the poor. The nature of this relationship it seems is that through greed and generational disconnects the ruling class swells, demands more and treats the working class worse and worse as each generation is less and less capable of humanizing the poor.
