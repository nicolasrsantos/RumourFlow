As a constituent of your district, I am asking you to please consider a plan which involves increased revenue in addition to spending cuts.  I am a staunch believer that the Bush tax cuts are hindering our economy much more than they are helping; the wealthy truly do not need these additional funds, yet our country desperately does.

Right at that moment, despite the professors being in denial about it, all of the jobs we were trained for were beginning to be outsourced to India.  Basically college was a train ride where there was no track at the edge of a cliff.  I got off at the next stop so to say and ended up going from my restaurant job and into a job doing simple/stupid web design for a computer illiterate owner of a local camera store; getting paid half of what a person with my skill set would normally yield.  Instead of accepting the fate that many of my fellow classmates did, whom for some reason also thought that going back into college, throwing more money at a wasted system would do them any better, I took my skills and used them for my own benefits.  I took my programming and web design skills and added a web store to a site that I made for fun back in high school in 2002.  That business now does 6 figures in gross sales and day by day it makes that silly web job I still have for now (that I am somewhat grateful for since I\u0027m no longer making icecream for fat/retarded assholes at Friendly\u0027s), less and less of a need.\n\nTo speed up the process of getting more seed money for my business I recently started job searching again, for something maybe part time and freelance from home.  Despite my background, the fact I created a web business that has done almost half a million dollars in sales since 2007 and have written for and attended a dinner meeting in the CEO office at Business Week in NYC...nobody is hiring me.  Hell, I won\u0027t even get a reply back from the jobs I sign up for.  I\u0027m not even looking for much, just something that equals the low pay of my day job but where I don\u0027t have to drive 70 miles each work day for a web job due to the boss being an idiot.  \n\nThe point I\u0027m trying to give is that the job market is indeed terrible.  I\u0027m not saying that you won\u0027t find anything but it seems like you better put what college is teaching you to your own benefit/business if you can.  The money spent on college now seems to be a terrible investment since the overall college mantra is to simply pigeon-hole people into few large companies and sugar coat them as \"dream jobs.\"  For me, working for somebody else is a nightmare and as us programmers know about pigeon-holing, there\u0027s only x number of spots and once they are filled, that\u0027s it, nobody else gets in.\n\nI\u0027m not saying quit college...but take what the professors/parents say to you with a grain of salt.  A door of opportunity might open up for you that others might think won\u0027t work when what everyone else is telling you to do might lead you to just waiting tables with $60K+ debt to pay off in addition to the hellish min wage job.\n\n...doubt this long rant would make reps listen but it\u0027s the truth to how the job market really is and the super rich and those in congress are not exposed to this reality.","duration":"","id":359,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_c28159m","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":351,"links":[350],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"granola_brother","label":"This is mine.

I, and other voters believe that President Obama\u0027s balances approach is the clear, responsible way to go. It is absolutely shocking to see the amount of immaturity in Washington, especially of the Republicans in the House. Please, remember and help our other representatives remember that politics come after the American people. We greatly appreciate what the government does for us.

Now is an critical time in history on both fronts and the nation is a short time away from making groundbreaking progress. Rhode Island should follow in the footsteps of NY and demonstrate itself to be a leader among these important social issues, and now is the time. The gay citizens of our state undoubtedly deserve the same rights as any other, and to deny them of their right to marriage is simply unfair. Likewise, it is only sensible to recognize that cannabis does no harm and is far less threatening than the countless prescription drugs abused each and every day. It really is just a plant - like tobacco, though with far less preservatives - and if everyone were to smoke a j and chill out perhaps they would be able to recognize that which is important in life - compassion, love, happiness.\n\nEven if you disagree with same-sex marriage and/or the legalization of marijuana, I think it is important to understand that in the not so distant future both will be legal across the nation. Being stubborn and making this transition difficult is to the benefit of no one. To the contrary, leading the movement will demonstrate you and the state of Rhode Island to be ahead of the curve. \n\nAlso, Boehner is just so frustratingly unintelligent, how do you not go mad?

Sacrifices must be made by everyone to fix problems that affect everyone. \"\n\nand later:\n\n\" As your constituent, I am telling you what I want: I want spending to be cut and revenue to be increased. That\u0027s it. Take a little out of each government program and increase taxes on those with the most wealth. Cutting programs alone will not fix the problem. If you are not familiar with the first stanza of \"Old Mother Hubbard,\" I suggest you read it and picture government programs as you do. If you cannot find it, my grandparents will be happy to show you a nursery rhyme book.

I share your concerns regarding the seriousness of our budget crisis and I appreciate the opportunity to respond.  \n\nThe federal debt, which is comprised of debt held by the public and intragovernmental debt, is subject to a statutory limit. The federal debt limit is currently $14.29 trillion dollars. Since taking office the Obama Administration has added $3.7 trillion dollars in deficit spending.  This, combined with decreased tax revenues as a result of the ongoing recession, caused us to reach the debt limit on May 16, 2011. Since that date the Treasury Department has been able to take a series of \"extraordinary measures\" that will temporarily allow the United States to meet its commitments until August 2, 2011. At that time, if the debt limit has not been raised, the federal government would be required to meet all of its obligations solely with revenues. The estimated shortfall of revenues to expenditures for the remainder of FY 2011 is $748 billion.  \n\nAny vote to raise the debt ceiling must be coupled with significant structural reforms to ensure that we do not arrive at this point again. That is why on July 19, 2011, I cosponsored and supported the passage of the Cut, Cap and Balance Act (H.R. 2560) on the House Floor.  Based on the Congressional Budget Office\u0027s March baseline, H.R. 2560 saves $111 billion in FY 2012 and approximately $5.8 trillion over 10 years.  In addition, enforceable caps on spending would have brought the size of government back below 20% of GDP -- its post-WWII average. Finally, the bill would prohibit the Secretary of Treasury from increasing the debt limit until the Archivist of the United States transmits to the states a qualifying Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution that has been approved in both chambers of Congress and is ready to be presented to the states for ratification. \n\nUnfortunately the Senate voted to suspend consideration of the Cut, Cap and Balance Act on July 22, 2011, while offering no alternatives.  Currently the Speaker of the House John Boehner and the Majority Leader of the Senate Harry Reid are continuing to negotiate a plan that would cut spending and raise the debt limit by the August 2nd deadline.  I support the Speaker\u0027s efforts to secure a plan that includes spending cuts equal to or greater than the corresponding increase to the debt limit and does not rely on accounting gimmicks or unspecified promises to find savings. \n\nWe cannot continue along the path proposed by the Obama Administration, which would institutionalize trillion dollar deficits for the foreseeable future, nor can we tax our way out of a spending problem.

[This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/izppe/obama_is_finally_calling_out_the_republicans_and/c281ejw?context\u003d3) sort of sums it up a bit better.  Democrats had control at some point.  Here we are years later with a health care plan that Obama conceded to on far too many levels, and TV speeches in which I walk away wondering why our President seems like such a pussy in how he gives credit to Boehner for just showing up.\n\nWhat a BS move Boehner pulled by not calling him back in a timely manor.  This is the President, show some respect even if you don\u0027t agree with him.  Hell, watch the West Wing and see what would have happened to you if you pulled that shit.  Childish as well.  I mean, are we in hish school here where not calling someone back is going to matter.  And WTF, that issue was newsworthy to any degree?  Keep the internal White House ass grabbing and meeting at the bike racks to fight someone to yourself.\n\nUgh, I give up, there is no point.  Someone is going to have to kill someone, or we are all going to have to literally riot in the streets.  We should take a cue from some of the other countries who have had to riot in order to save themselves. \n\nMany say we are not there yet to need to do that.  But if we idly sit and do nothing, we will be there, and with the size of our country/government/military/police, we don\u0027t have the luxury of waiting, it will be too late and we will be unable to defend our rights, they will be gone already.","duration":"","id":522,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_c2860hm","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":521,"links":[495],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"analfuck","label":"Exact reason why I have always thought the Democrats were pussys.","duration":"","id":521,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_c284e9f","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":495,"links":[494],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"OrgasmicRegret","label":"I agree, classy speech.\n\nHowever, if I can make some generalizations that may not be too kind...\n\nPretend you lost a chunk of your IQ points, pretend you did not go to college, pretend you were already mad at Obama, pretend you did not understand moderately challenging words and concepts, and pretend you voted based on religion, skin color, and other nonsense.\n\nNow, watch the Obama video, then the Boner one.\n\nThe Obama one is a little confusing to some I suspect.

The argument that letting the top marginal income rates go back to where they were in 1990’s would hurt small businesses is just a smokescreen. This is a tried-and-true method used by conservatives to confuse and obfuscate, and pretend that tax cuts for the very wealthy help anyone else besides just the very wealthy.\n\n\n\n* http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/30/AR2010073002671.html\n\u0026gt;And just as most small businesses aren\u0027t owned by people in the top income brackets, most people in the top income brackets don\u0027t rely mainly on small-business income: According to the Tax Policy Center, such proceeds make up a majority of income for about 40 percent of households in the top income bracket and a third of households in the second-highest bracket. If the objective is to help small businesses, continuing the Bush tax cuts on high-income taxpayers isn\u0027t the way to go -- it would miss more than 98 percent of small-business owners and would primarily help people who don\u0027t make most of their money off those businesses. \n\n\n\n* http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/edmund-l-andrews/1889/would-ending-bush-tax-cuts-rich-hurt-small-business\n\u0026gt;Republicans claim this would be a disaster for small business owners, because \"50 percent\u0027\u0027 of small business income would be \"captured\" by the higher tax rates.

Instead, the corporation\u0027s income or losses are divided among and passed through to its shareholders. The shareholders must then report the income or loss on their own individual income tax returns. This concept is called single taxation; if the corporation is taxed as a C corporation, it will face double taxation, meaning both the corporation\u0027s profits, and the shareholders\u0027 dividends, will be taxed.\nAs with partnerships, the income, deductions, and tax credits of an S corporation flow through to shareholders annually, regardless of whether distributions are made. Thus, income is taxed at the shareholder level and not at the corporate level. Payments to S shareholders by the corporation are distributed tax-free to the extent that the distributed earnings were not previously taxed. Also, certain corporate penalty taxes (e.g., accumulated earnings tax, personal holding company tax) and the alternative minimum tax do not apply to an S corporation.","duration":"","id":557,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_c27zqpf","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":556,"links":[494],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Hayrack","label":"Of course the richest 2% already pay most of the taxes.

The beginning of your argument should state your thesis simply and in a manner that will not alienate readers. Everyone who disagrees with you is now mad at you already, and you haven\u0027t even started proving why they\u0027re wrong yet! If you try something softer, like \"Following quite a bit of academic research, I believe that Obama\u0027s presidency has been one of the most detrimental in history.\" Granted, it\u0027s not the best-written sentence ever (seems a bit awkward and maybe too formal for reddit); but a reader who disagrees with that, might still keep reading.\n\nThis second sentence also introduces another issue which will pervade your post: vagueness. If you have academic credentials, wear them loud and proud. \"I\u0027ve got an MA in American Politics and I\u0027ve worked for a think tank for the last two years\" or whatever you\u0027ve got. Your entire life is a long time to study politics; let us know what you\u0027ve accomplished in your studies. In addition to strengthening your argument, this would provoke yet another automatic reaction in the intellectually-minded among your readers: respect.

And yes, the failures of grammar that fill your post are generally not major (missing capitalization, confusing pronouns, maybe a comma  missing here and there). But: bad grammar makes your seem stupid. This here is the flip side of the academic credentials argument. Intellectually-minded readers will think you\u0027re stupid, and therefore will think you\u0027re wrong. Just be more careful with grammar and your argument will seem better. And I know you\u0027re willing to hold down \u0027shift\u0027 to make capitals; you do it with the word \u0027U.S.\u0027 every time, and that\u0027s way harder to type than a single letter at the beginning of a sentence.\n\n\u0026gt;he has continued Bush\u0027s policies against civil rights and expanded many of them. he has bankrupted us through continued spending hikes and maintaining the taxes of the Bush era. \n\nAgain, specifics. \"Obama personally signed the Lock Up Everyone Who Won\u0027t Say I\u0027m Great Act of 2010.

Now we\u0027re intentionally throwing in provocative things. We\u0027ve hooked the audience with our interesting (but restrained) thesis, we\u0027ve wowed them with how smart we are, now we want to punch them right in the gut. Give them something to piss them off that still has a logical place in your argument.\n\n\u0026gt;although most of his supporters are locked into the insane mindset that he\u0027s \"fighting the rich people,\" he personally signed an extension of the tax cuts passed under Bush. \n\nThis... is not totally terrible. Really. You\u0027ve mentioned a specific program, and used an effective contrast. Again, grammar\u0027s a problem, because you\u0027re not quoting anyone specific, so quotation marks aren\u0027t appropriate... but that\u0027s relatively minor. I applaud this sentence. Kudos on this. And this alone.\n\n\u0026gt;i have never seen such an insane spectacle in my entire life as \"U.S. politics.\" this entire thing is a game to bankrupt the U.S. populace and make it appear as though some kind of earth-shattering moral conflict is occurring between the thieves.\n\nUh-oh. We\u0027re falling a bit off the deep end here. You\u0027ve completely stopped including any facts, and are going full-on emotional appeal. Really, the only time you can abandon facts after the end of your intro is your conclusion. So maybe we\u0027re entering the conclusion, then. If we are, it\u0027s a bit early. I wouldn\u0027t mind a bit more insight into what makes Obama bad before we head straight into summing up.\n\nBecause really, that\u0027s all you\u0027re doing in a conclusion. You\u0027ve given us a few facts, and those facts each tell us Obama is bad. Now we need to bring it together, and thereby elevate it. Drive home what you want us to have learned (your thesis) by referring to the facts listed above. In your intro, you told us what you think; now tell us how the facts you have told us prove what you think. Instead you nearly repeat yourself word-for-word:\n\nYour second sentence:\n\n\u0026gt;... i can say that i am more disgusted with Obama than any President before him.\n\nYour third-to-last sentence: \n\n\u0026gt;i have never seen such an insane spectacle...\n\nSee what you did there? Your argument hasn\u0027t been bolstered by your facts. It just sat there, staying the same.\n\n\u0026gt;i am prepared to defend every part of that statement given the chance. i cannot believe the arrogance that /r/politics displays in downvoting any of my posts that dares to criticize Obama.\n\nDon\u0027t bring reddit into this. Your beef is with Obama, not reddit. You bash reddit and people will get pissed at you, regardless of whether or not they agree with the rest of your argument. Most people on reddit like reddit. If you were making this argument in a daycare, you wouldn\u0027t include casual references to how much you hate Spongebob, would you? No, because then the kids would be crying and no one would listen. Same principle here.\n\nAlso using the word \u0027dare\u0027 is silly. I know that\u0027s not a very useful of specific critique, but I don\u0027t know how else to put it. It makes it seem like you\u0027re putting yourself on a pedestal, as a martyr. First, you\u0027re not a martyr; you\u0027re posting on a public discussion board. And second, people loooove to knock people off of pedestals.\n\nIf the word \u0027dare\u0027 is meant to be taken ironically, I can tell you that the irony is getting lost. The word \u0027dare\u0027 fits too well with the apparently-unironic claims of doom and gloom above. Wouldn\u0027t one have to \u0027dare\u0027 to attack a group who are apparently intentionally playing \"a game to bankrupt the U.S. populace?\" Don\u0027t combine bombast and ironic bombast; they\u0027re too hard to distinguish. And if it\u0027s not ironic, it\u0027s still a bad word choice.\n\n\nThere\u0027s probably more problems with your post that I could discuss with you if you were interested, but for now I\u0027m pretty tired.

The beginning of your argument should state your thesis simply and in a manner that will not alienate readers. Everyone who disagrees with you is now mad at you already, and you haven\u0027t even started proving why they\u0027re wrong yet! If you try something softer, like \"Following quite a bit of academic research, I believe that Obama\u0027s presidency has been one of the most detrimental in history.\" Granted, it\u0027s not the best-written sentence ever (seems a bit awkward and maybe too formal for reddit); but a reader who disagrees with that, might still keep reading.\n\nThis second sentence also introduces another issue which will pervade your post: vagueness. If you have academic credentials, wear them loud and proud. \"I\u0027ve got an MA in American Politics and I\u0027ve worked for a think tank for the last two years\" or whatever you\u0027ve got. Your entire life is a long time to study politics; let us know what you\u0027ve accomplished in your studies. In addition to strengthening your argument, this would provoke yet another automatic reaction in the intellectually-minded among your readers: respect. And people will assume you\u0027re right if they think you\u0027re smarter than them.\n\n\u0026gt;he has raised military spending beyond where Bush took it. \n\nLook, I hate to say it, but grammar matters, and this sentence sucks. I know, this is the internet, so you can get away with a lot. I\u0027m certain there will be a few mistakes in this post I\u0027m currently writing. And yes, the failures of grammar that fill your post are generally not major (missing capitalization, confusing pronouns, maybe a comma  missing here and there). But: bad grammar makes your seem stupid. This here is the flip side of the academic credentials argument. Intellectually-minded readers will think you\u0027re stupid, and therefore will think you\u0027re wrong. Just be more careful with grammar and your argument will seem better. And I know you\u0027re willing to hold down \u0027shift\u0027 to make capitals; you do it with the word \u0027U.S.\u0027 every time, and that\u0027s way harder to type than a single letter at the beginning of a sentence.\n\n\u0026gt;he has continued Bush\u0027s policies against civil rights and expanded many of them. he has bankrupted us through continued spending hikes and maintaining the taxes of the Bush era. \n\nAgain, specifics. \"Obama personally signed the Lock Up Everyone Who Won\u0027t Say I\u0027m Great Act of 2010. He approved $140 million dollars in funding for a jobs program in South Africa, while 18 million Americans went jobless.\" I\u0027m totally making up these facts, by the way, but don\u0027t they sound impressive? Doesn\u0027t it sound like I\u0027ve done my research, and don\u0027t my examples make you shocked and angry?\n\nOoo... \u0027shock\u0027 and \u0027anger.\u0027 More emotions! Now we\u0027re intentionally throwing in provocative things. We\u0027ve hooked the audience with our interesting (but restrained) thesis, we\u0027ve wowed them with how smart we are, now we want to punch them right in the gut.

Its both parties fault. The question is when will both parties realize there are issues they both have in common and try to work that out as a start.

The problem with politicians is once they are in office they are so committed to “help” or “funding” they received to get into office; they have no choice but to keep being the puppet. I personally feel that a lot of politicians want to make a change and to really help people. They just get snapped back by the money that put them there. Too many promises were made and now they spend most of their time making up for these promises.  But to put the blame 100% on one party is silly.

This should have just been a routine vote to raise the debt ceiling, but Republicans turned it into a crusade to try and get votes.\n\nOdds are they were hoping to get the Democrats defensive, and then swoop in with a compromise at the last minute. That way they get to look like the heroes that averted disaster.\n\nInstead, Obama makes them an offer they shouldn\u0027t be able to refuse. He sort of poison pills it by throwing in the tax increases. This was actually a win/win. If they accepted it, the Republicans voted to increase taxes and cut social security. On top of that, Obama and the Democrats were the ones to swoop in with a plan that saves the day. However, if the Republicans reject it, they paint themselves into a corner. There is no way for them to save face. If the talks break down, Obama is the one that came to the table willing to sacrifice what he believes in to avert disaster. The Republicans look like petulant children.\n\nIn the end, if the deadline elapses, Obama has to move around some funds to keep the country from defaulting. It means some public employees won\u0027t get paid, however, the Republicans feet will be to the fire. They will have a hard time limit that it would be political suicide to miss at that point. In the end they come back to the table with their hat in their hand. The democrats can put them through the ringer. The Republicans will have to compromise, they will probably have to accept a deal that is worse than what Obama offered. They will look like morons for refusing it in the first place.\n\nAt this point if the Republicans can\u0027t get a better deal than what was offered, they will look ridiculously incompetent. The Democrats already looked reasonable, they don\u0027t have to do the Republicans any favors.\n\nIn any event, I find it nearly impossible to believe we will default. We may hit a point where some people aren\u0027t getting paid, but in the end a deal will have to be struck.\n\nEven though the Republicans seem crazy, I find it hard to believe they want to see the country default.

You also might want to run this one by people who actually run schools or something.\n\n\u0026gt;the first cut is the Department of Defense. current declared DoD spending is $2230 per capita - $687 billion total - annually for the U.S., the highest on the planet. this will be reduced to the level of China, the second highest, who spend $85.93 per capita on military spending.\n\nWhile I\u0027m all for major cuts to the DoD, saying that we are going to cut 97% of the budget overnight is just stupid. I don\u0027t think it could even be done from a purely logistical standpoint, even with unanimous approval.\n\n\nBasically, your post was not at all serious about the budget, let alone political realities. Your choice of numbers are arbitrary, based on random other numbers and not on a cost benefit analysis. Moreover, your premise of this post I\u0027m responding to is that taxes are not necessary, and if you disagree you are intellectually impaired. Nice preemptive ad hominem. Aside from that, taxes are a method of distributing resources in a society. Right now we have a drastically disproportionate and unhealthy distribution. Taxation is the most efficient way to redistribute away from those who are not contributing to society proportionally to their benefit (uber-rich people). \n\nAs far as statements like \n\n\u0026gt;researching the truth about Wikileaks, which represents the largest loss of credibility for any government in human history and a total loss of credibility for the Obama administration\n\nand\n\n\u0026gt;i am willing to debate anyone who disagrees.\n\nThere isn\u0027t anything to debate since you provide no grounds or justifications, just bald assertions as if they are facts. Why would I put in the effort to debate you when you haven\u0027t stated your position in an even initially defensible manner?","duration":"","id":946,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_c27yjf4","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":945,"links":[931],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"slipstri0","label":"everyone who still thinks that we need tax increases in the U.S. has failed at:\n\na) reading comments on reddit articles\n\nb) researching the historical federal budget\n\nc) researching the federal budget for the last ten years\n\nd) analyzing the causes of federal spending growth\n\ne) analyzing the speech patterns of politicians and identifying reinforced suggestion techniques\n\nf) life\n\ng) listening to what every mainstream political stance had to say about the subject\n\nh) analyzing the causes of increasing federal debt\n\ni) understanding the truth about human behavior\n\nj) reading prior literature, in English or in other languages, that describes the true motivations of tax increases (i.e., \"Robin Hood\" (ROBIN HOOD VS.

He\u0027s trying to drag this thing out but he won\u0027t admit that it\u0027s because he doesn\u0027t want it to get in the way of his chances of being re-elected. Boehner pointed this out but it seems most of reddit is too brain washed by the liberal media to have noticed that.  The longer we allow for the raised debt ceiling, the further in debt we will go.

Then Republicans can try to enjoin his action or impeach him citing abuse of power. And if people go along with it then the Supreme Court decides what\u0027s what. \n\nIt\u0027s really less a matter of pure legal principle and more a matter of how the other actors decide to handle it. There aren\u0027t really serious safeguards against frivolous suits and impeachments by Congress, and it\u0027s an untested legal question, so Congress can pretty much rationalize acting however it wants. (I mean, they could say \"We\u0027re impeaching Obama for being a Democrat\" but they don\u0027t because voters would go crazy. With this obscure and at-least-superficially debatable legal issue, they don\u0027t have that problem.) Meanwhile the Supreme Court isn\u0027t going to be impartial, so it\u0027s going to be a zoo. \n\nAnyway, your wording is pretty far off:\n\n\u0026gt;The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.\n\nI believe the argument is that the debt ceiling itself is unconstitutional because of that. The debt ceiling implies that some US debts would not be considered valid and be repaid if (for some reason good or bad) the total of all our debts wound up exceeding a certain amount. Being unconstitutional, the debt ceiling would be null and void: the President or anyone else could completely ignore it without any legal consequence. \n\nAnother way to look at it is, what makes the debt ceiling supersede a normal law like a budget bill or the law that mandates borrowing to fund any given program? It has no such special authority: they\u0027re all simply laws passed by the same body. It\u0027s not *supposed* to be legal for Obama to just stop Social Security payments with the stroke of a pen.

Apparently it is considered perfectly acceptable to ask the poor and middle class to sacrifice for the country\u0027s sake by gutting social security and so-called \"entitlement programs\" yet when the rich are also asked to make sacrifices by way of tax increases (and they aren\u0027t even tax increases, they would simply be repealing tax breaks and closing obvious exploitation of loopholes) many people act as if the government is out of control. I simply don\u0027t understand this.\n\nPersonally, I think the tax cuts should not only be removed, I think we should then increase taxes on anyone making more than a million dollars a year by 10% and anyone making more than a billion dollars a year by 30%. I don\u0027t think the middle class and the poor share any of the responsibility for our current situation and asking them to sacrifice is ludicrous. The American public did not want these wars. They didn\u0027t exploit the banking and mortgage disaster.\n\nFurther more, it is not the rich that create jobs in this country. It is the rich that control the jobs in this country but it is the masses, the majority, the middle to poor classes, that create jobs. Every time someone buys something they create a job for multiple people. \n\nThe rich are parasites that are slowly killing our country by, with increasing effectiveness, leaching the hard earned money of the american public and then instead of reinvesting it, spending it on themselves or their own wealth.\n\nIt\u0027s shocking to me that it is even a debate that the rich should make sacrifices.","duration":"","id":1103,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c27z0en","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Obama is finally calling out the Republicans and thoroughly explaining the deficit problem, right now.","label":"coolweasel","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_izppe","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.311671497E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.311680439E9,"simScore":0.8215435316575338,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},{"index":1104,"links":[1103],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"megabits","label":"You wouldn\u0027t say these things if you were ~~rich~~ a job creator.","duration":"","id":1104,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_c27zh1e","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1103,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"beginning_end","label":"I wrote this earlier today to some of my friends.

Several of the things he is saying is either disingenuous or outright lies.\n\nA few examples, claiming that we used a surplus to find tax cuts when in fact revenue dropped after 9/11 and the dot com burst, before tax cuts were passed, and revenue rose as a % of GDP after the cuts were passed to above historical averages until this crash came around (which had little to do with tax rates).\n\nClaiming the republicans had the deficit on track for over $1 trillion before he took office when, in fact, the deficit was less than half that before emergency spending measure were passed, all of which occurred with his support either as president or as a member of the democrat controlled congress.\n\nClaiming he has a plan to reduce the deficit by $4 trillion when his promised compromise would actually raise the debt by $6 trillion over the next decade ($4 trillion less than the increased budget he wanted, so he calls it cuts).  Plus he promises cuts later, with no details on what the cuts specifically would be, in exchange for tax increases now.  The republicans made this same compromise in the 90\u0027s and the cuts never actually happened.  The republicans \n\nAnd finally, claiming that it is necessary to raise the debt ceiling in order to pay bills we have already incurred and prevent our credit rating from dropping.  This is flat our false, we tax in enough tax revenue to service the debt, pay social security and medicare (in addition to covering defense).  Everything else in the budget is future spending, not covering old bills.  And every indication is that our credit rating depends more on strong reductions to the deficit now and not the debt ceiling being raise (only a politician could claim that the only way we can pay our debts and maintain a solid credit rating is borrowing even more money).\n\nI have not has a chance to check out Boehner\u0027s speech yet, but I have to imagine he was about as full of shit as Obama was.

It implies that going more into debt will somehow make you less in debt on its own.  That isn\u0027t what anybody is claiming.\n\nWhat economists describe as the function of a responsible government in a time of economic trouble is to stimulate the economy, using borrowed money if necessary.  That economic stimulus keeps people employed, which keeps them spending their paychecks, which keeps other people employed, and so on.  Since each one of those people pays taxes, the government is able to temporarily spend money to keep the economy running, and then recoup the money it spends by collecting taxes.\n\n\u0026gt; over the last several years has not worked well\n\n\"The last several years\" is a very short time frame when it comes to recessions in general.  When it comes to what had the potential to be a second great depression, it\u0027s such a short time frame that it\u0027s hardly worth considering.  Even the optimists never expected the economy to turn around in \"several years\".\n\n\u0026gt; It can be argued that the bailout packages ... were risky and selfish and bad for allus common folks.\n\nIt can also be argued that the moon is made out of cheese, that doesn\u0027t make it so.\n\nThere were a lot of problems with the bailout packages.  Nobody liked them, from the banks, to the democrats, to the republicans, to the public.  Everybody thought they should have been done differently.  Some people think the banks should have been allowed to fail, even if it caused a massive collapse of the entire world\u0027s economy.  Others think the banks should have been directly nationalized.  Some people think that the employees of the banks should have all been fired, others argue that even their extravagant bonuses were necessary because, distasteful as it was, the only way to keep the economy running at all smoothly was to allow some of the same people who caused the problems to use their unique knowledge to try to undo some of their mistakes.\n\n\u0026gt; You should blame the republicans. You should blame the democrats too.\n\nBlaming them is blaming a symptom.  They\u0027re doing the job they were elected to do.  That job isn\u0027t to do what\u0027s best for the country, but to do whatever will get them elected again.

On so many important issues of late congress has decided to act out of step with their constituents (HR 1424 is a perfect example). This is not how democracy works.

Rest assured, I will vote for an increase in the debt ceiling. Just between you and me, I am going to let you in on a few Washington secrets. I have a sweet job. I get treated so well everywhere I go, I am a big deal. I also am very wealthy and own quite a bit of land. Don\u0027t worry, I am not going to jeopardize this gravy train with biscuit wheels. The more money I spend for my constituents, the more vote for me. Also, the more money congress spends, the more the banks make. You see, the federal reserve loans congress and the govt money for all the things we use it for. Then we pay back the federal reserve with your tax money. Your tax money doesn\u0027t go to schools, war, obama\u0027s jet. We borrow the money from the federal reserve to pay for all those things. By the way, the federal reserve is not federal, it\u0027s just a group of my banker friends. They thought putting federal in the name was a good idea, makes it seem all official and ethical. \n\nNext, democracy stopped working a long time ago. Plutocracy. Corporatocracy. Is profitocracy a word? Those might be more accurate.\n\nLastly, the military spending is not a boondoggle. You have any idea how much money and profits war creates? A lot. Lots and lots. So much, it runs the country. Healthcare/pharma makes a lot too. You have no idea.\n\nThank you again for you letter.

Rest assured, I will vote for an increase in the debt ceiling. Just between you and me, I am going to let you in on a few Washington secrets. I have a sweet job. I get treated so well everywhere I go, I am a big deal. I also am very wealthy and own quite a bit of land. Don\u0027t worry, I am not going to jeopardize this gravy train with biscuit wheels. The more money I spend for my constituents, the more vote for me. Also, the more money congress spends, the more the banks make. You see, the federal reserve loans congress and the govt money for all the things we use it for. Then we pay back the federal reserve with your tax money. Your tax money doesn\u0027t go to schools, war, obama\u0027s jet. We borrow the money from the federal reserve to pay for all those things. By the way, the federal reserve is not federal, it\u0027s just a group of my banker friends. They thought putting federal in the name was a good idea, makes it seem all official and ethical. \n\nNext, democracy stopped working a long time ago. Plutocracy. Corporatocracy. Is profitocracy a word? Those might be more accurate.\n\nLastly, the military spending is not a boondoggle. You have any idea how much money and profits war creates? A lot. Lots and lots. So much, it runs the country. Healthcare/pharma makes a lot too. You have no idea.\n\nThank you again for you letter.

We either need to simply cut spending, or maybe figure out a way to peg spending to growth, in case we get the economy back on track.\n\nBut I don\u0027t see how defaulting on obligations that we actually can meet can possibly be good for the government or the economy.

I can understand the idea that, maybe, taxes are too high, but the symbolism of cutting programs that help the poor and desperate without increasing taxes on the happiest and wealthiest even a bit is just horrific.

That\u0027s not how an economy based on supply and demand works. There is a wide consumer demand for a product and thus the supply is required to increase to meet that demand, which causes a greater profit.

But the dirty little secret people don\u0027t mention as often is the other way they save money but \"retain jobs\"; contracting. These companies hire from temporary agencies and establish a relationship with the agency\u0027s temp hires, which alleviates their responsibility to pay medical or retirement expenses for the person, and makes it so they have no recourse to potentially unfair termination, due in large part to legal wording or threats from the temp agency the employee works for directly.\n\nTo avoid government intervention in this questionable practice, most companies have a written N-Year Rule in place which, from the outside, looks fair. It states that after some given amount of time has passed, the person will either become a full-fledged employee of the company, or they will be released back to the temp agency to pursue other work. However, because of the talent that has been often shoehorned into the position of needing to use a temp agency in the first place, companies will rotate information on their temporary personnel to keep the talent in place without giving them the rights or respect they deserve. The employee never complains because they aren\u0027t losing their job, but at the same time, they are not gaining anything either.\n\nAt this rate, we are producing a country whose dominant jobs are performed by skilled, talented workers whose company has no loyalty to them and vice versa; who keep looking over their shoulder expecting to be terminated for no reason; who have nothing to fall back on because their organization doesn\u0027t need to provide a retirement plan.

Businesses must reevaluate, make new decisions and order reductions or expansions in production and expenditures. This means that months pass before spending is affected. Monetary policy typically has a short policy lag (the time it takes to create and implement policy) and a long expenditure lag (the time it takes businesses and consumers to adjust to the new interest rates). The total lag time is usually 9-12 months and varies a good bit. Thus when the Federal Reserve changes interest rates now, their decisions will affect economic conditions in approximately a year from the time of the change.\n\nFiscal policy (changing taxes and government spending) also has a significant lag time. It typically has a long policy lag (the time it takes Congress to approve a tax or spending change) and a short expenditure lag (the time it takes consumers to experience the tax changes and government to change spending). **The combined lags may be anywhere from one to almost five years**.\"","duration":"","id":1531,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c27yhzi","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Obama is finally calling out the Republicans and thoroughly explaining the deficit problem, right now.","label":"coolweasel","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_izppe","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.311671497E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.311675872E9,"simScore":0.7340466224382265,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":1532,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"patcher","label":"And all any of my friends are talking about related to it is how he\u0027s interrupting the Bachelorette.
