Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University. Allen supported Obama, and in 2008, she tracked the origins of this claim to a perennial candidate and litigant in Illinois named **Andy Martin in 2004**. the record shows that a couple of Clinton campaign volunteers in Iowa passed along emails with that claim. Such emails had been circulating for several months. The volunteers did not share this rumor widely, and at least one paid Clinton staffer immediately renounced it. The Clinton campaign moved quickly to remove the volunteers. We could find no evidence of a deeper connection to Clinton or her campaign.\n\n\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nDamn Fox News.
