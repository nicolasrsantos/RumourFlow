Five time World Cup champion Brazil with its 200 million people gets the same voting power in FIFA as Montserrat, a tiny island \"nation\" of 5,000 people who has never come even close to qualifying for the World Cup. Germany may be a world powerhouse and sport a multi-billion euro league with the worlds best national team crammed with superstar millionaire players, but its no more influential in this FIFA election than Turks and Caicos Islands (whose entire population is a less than 1% of the German city of Berlin) and which has an amateur league. Sepp Blatter is really popular in these smaller, poorer countries because if you actually look at how FIFA allocates its development funds he does give a big amount to the smaller national associations. A few million in funding means a hell of a lot to Togo or Cayman Islands, but not much to England or Brazil. The structure of FIFA almost ensures that Sepp is in power.\n\nThey had an interview with various African FIFA executives before the elections, and they were all praising Sepp for how much he has given to their national associations in terms of FIFA funding and how he has worked to expand the AFC Cup of Nations.","duration":"","id":182,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_crp5q02","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":181,"links":[1],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"cuen","label":"Although undoubtly there is large amounts of corruption within FIFA, the election of sepp blatter is not per se the result of corruption.

But they had a Viking infestation. A Danish house ruled intermittently in 1013-1014 during the House of Wessex's span as the royal line. Then again from 1016-1042. Before being again ousted by the House of Wessex for good. Before being ousted by the French Normans under William who was born in Normandy. He was succeeded by Henry I who was likely born in England by most accounts. But Henry I was succeeded by Stephen of Blios when he usurped Henry's daughter, Matilda, for her claim to the throne. As his name suggests, he was born in the French county of Blios.\n\nStephen eventually gave succession of the throne to Matilda's son because his own had died. Now, Matilda had been married to William of Anjou (the Norman's main competitor in France) to create an alliance. So their son ushered in the Angevin Empire which held a swathe of France as well as the throne to England. And it was their preference to focus on French affairs and didn't view England as their home. It was an extension of their empire.\n\nThe last Angevin king was good, old King John of Robin Hood fame. Younger brother of Richard the Lionheart and touted asshole. If you'll remember he is ousted by the Barons of England backed by the French and forced to sign the Magna Carta. This left King fucking Louis VIII of *France* as King to England. Which the Barons and people were cool with, actually. But Louis admitted he was never really king and handed over power to the appropriate parties for a hefty sum.\n\nThis begins the official start of the Plantaganet kings, Henry III. The reason he is considered different is because Richard the Lionheart's death while campaigning had created a succession crisis in the Angevin's French holdings of Normandy, Brittany, and Anjou. His nephew Arthur was pit against King John and ultimately John was only nominated to hold onto Normandy (and England). And from Henry III onwards you have a shit ton of born and bred English monarchs.\n\nUp until the Stuarts, who were the Scottish royals and followed after Elizabeth I, daughter of ol', nasty Henry VIII, founder of crazybasterdism, erm, the Church of England. The Stuarts keep going until that whole Commonwealth thing. Then the Stuart heir-in-exile Mary II of England is invited back and rules as equal with her husband William of Orange, who is famously Dutch. Then it's Queen Anne and the Acts of Union. Which consolidates Scotland and England as under one crown.\n\nAnne died with no children so the crown went to George I of the House of Hanover, who was related to King James VI of Scotland (And King James I of England) as the great grandfather on the maternal line. As the line suggests, he was born in Hanover, which isn't in England for you folks slow on geography. It's in Germany (though it wasn't Germany at the time). Whose son was George the II, last king born outside of England.\n\nThus making the guy above me correct.

When he was first elected, he created a scheme where FIFA gave every 209 nations $1 million + for football development at the grass root level. Here in Europe, especially in England, that sort of money makes no difference, but in smaller countries, esp those is Asia, South America and Africa, that money goes a long way, even if a too much goes to corrupt officials, he is seen as the man who builds pitches and academies in countries where if it wasnt for him, they wouldn't have them. Furthermore with your point about UEFA withdrawing from the WC, surely it wrong that roughly 25% of countries, the richer ones, have so much influence. That is not fair. If Prince Ali had been elected, personally I feel the World Cup (event) would remain on a closed circuit of A lister European Countries, with a few other rich nations. SA 2010 was probably achieved by corruption, but it was a success. I agree that Qatar is stupid, but you see my point. And finally I think you underestimate Blatter. In Europe, we have a conception that Blatter stayin in power is our lack of action. You don't stay in power that long without being smart and ruthless. A lot of people underneath him might not be so smart, but I seriously doubt whether any agency/law enforcement will be able to link him to the corruption.

He is the FIFA President, of course his signature would be on official FIFA documents.  \n\nAlso this Jaimie Fuller guy saying the rights were undersold isn't that relevant either. Its FIFA's prerogative to sell it at any price. Its not a Govt body. Rights have ALWAYS been undersold and despite that FIFA still makes Billions. \n\nIf this 5% of real value(whoever came with that metric) argument is used then FIFA might well be expected to get like $40 BILLION for every 4 year WC cycle, instead of the 2-4 currently.  \n\nFIFA's finances are clean and transparent. They are paranoid about this because they report to the Swiss, the only one who have any sort of leverage over FIFA. They make their finance reports public every year.  \n\nThe corruption happens outside of official FIFA's circle. They don't use official FIFA paperwork to move money.  \nFurther corruption happens when the rights holders sell it on for greater value to Broadcasters and there are kick-backs.  \nOr behind the scene business deals, favor exchanges.  \n\nThere is a chain to this like any product has, FIFA is at the bottom like a Farmer selling his produce(WC is the produce of FIFA), he isn't going to receive the final value of his produce because there are multiple players in the middle of the chain.\n\nThis latest report doesn't seem to show anything significant.\n\nedit: Also The Caribbean Population(in CFU region) in 2005 was around 38 Million. The same as Tanzania. What was the rights deal in that country? 250K might seem low but other regions(those which are not football hot beds esp.) with similar relative populations are not far off. \n\nImagine if FIFA was selling rights for market value. We'll be paying 10 times more for our TV channels and there would be ads all over the place. \n\nAs the OP mentions, the price is small to generate revenue for all concerned. FIFA is already making Billions. But if FA's, business, etc can in the meantime generate revenue its all good, that is as long as people like Warner allow the system to work. Which is why the problem is less FIFA and more the people in Domestic FA's because FIFA is nothing but a collection of FA's.

Charities, healthcare institutions, religious, scientific, literary, political, and private foundations could all qualify as a NP or NFP. \n\nBoth NPs and NFPs conduct business without the purpose of paying dividends to the owners or shareholders. The difference between NP and NFP primarily based on size, structure, and membership. \n-NP: large enough to warrant a governing body; paid salary employees, does not pay dividends to owners/stakeholders, uses discretionary income to reach the company's goals to benefit their target community. \n-NFP: typically smaller organization like hobby or [amateur] sports clubs; membership may benefit from income (not dividends) I.e. Selling candy bars to send your local youth team to a travel tourny. These typically have smaller tax benefits than NPs. \n\nThe shit of the point is: NPs and NFPs all operate for a profit (if you don't profit, then you can't exist). NPs can pay outrageous salaries/bonuses to employees, as long as they apply enough discretionary income to their intended community; if they don't they will get relegated to NFP status. Note: employee salaries/bonuses are not the same as dividends to owners or stake/share holders. \n\nSo yes FIFA is a NP. What type? I guess they claim Charitable because of where/how the discretionary income is applied. Are they as greedy as your stereotypical \"Big Business\" company? Fack yes.

FIFA doesn't even  have to gets its hands dirty.  If any corruption is dug up, all it has to do is clutch it's pearls and pretend they knew nothing of it, which legally they don't, so they are scott free.  \n\nThe most Blatter can face from the FBI is a subpena to give a deposition.

Looking at some of the criticism of the Qatar bid:\n\n**Re: 'they're not a football country'**\n\nThe Qatar World Cup bid (and the purchase of PSG) is part of an effort to essentially protect the country by making it highly identified (and 'friendly') to the western world - we have seen exactly the same method employed by for example the Abu Dhabi Group at City, Roman Abramovich at Chelsea, Usmanov at Arsenal, not to mention others of course who have failed miserably such as Venky's at Blackburn, or perhaps Carson Yeung at Birmingham.  \n\n(Remains to be seen of course whether the current corruption allegations and spotlight on labour conditions actually harms their original intent - the case was made in a recent podcast, [*One World Sports AET: The FIFA Politics of Soft Power and Scandal*](http://www.beyondthepitch.net/podcasts/edition/index.cfm/one-world-sports-aet/2014/06/03/), that it's highly probable that it was Western PR agencies who have sold this venture to the Qataris in the first place, promising that they could improve their image and control the Western media spin.)\n\nAnyway when billionaires are using their wealth to fund clubs, many applaud their behaviour as 'simply necessary to break into the elite', or shrug their shoulders, or point out the positive things such investment can bring.  It's a tangential debate, but nevertheless frames the reasons why Qatar bid in the first place.  \n\nIn theory there's nothing wrong with what they are trying to do - and of course the same 'not a footballing country' argument could have been made against USA 1994, or Australia 2022.  \n\nIt also fits with the FIFA remit of globalising football, something which has paid off handsomely for other organisations such as the Man United brand, BSkyB, and of course the Premier League itself.\n\n**Re: the bidding process**\n\nIt certainly appears to have been deeply corrupt, however if it wasn't a Middle Eastern country we might not focus on it so much - the bidding process has likely been very corrupt in most countries for many years.  \n\nI posted yesterday about some of the scandals that occurred in the English approach to their bid, so I won't bother re-posting it now, suffice to say that the English are hardly above this method of influence in politics themselves - in fact currently helping Qatar in their time of 'media spin' troubles is none other than [former head of the FA David Davies](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football//article4108374.ece).\n\nIn addition the recent Olympics in London was prey to ['gravy train' behaviour](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football/article4107289.ece), and of course arguably the biggest sporting-event bidding scandal prior to the recent Qatar allegations [actually came out of the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Winter_Olympic_bid_scandal).\n\nI think there is also possibly some misunderstanding about Platini's involvement.  \n\nPlatini, like Blatter, has based his political power on a platform of inclusion for the 'smaller' countries.  So basically that's his 'campaign promise', and therefore excludes him from backing, for example, the US.  \n\nThe allegation against him is that French president Sarkozy pressured him into a quid-pro-quo vote for Qatar, in order to push for Qatari investment in France (which of course has happened with PSG, not sure about other sectors).  So basically you have a *French* president pressuring a *French* representative to side with the needs of *French* industry.   Even if the allegations are true, for me this doesn't really seem like the crime of the century or anything.\n\nThere is also the side issue of the English media vs Platini.  They seem to hate Platini for several reasons, but one of them is FFP - his attempts to curb spending have been met with much criticism, some justified of course.   \n\nHowever I find this a touch hypocritical, since the Qatari investment in the World Cup is, as I attempted to describe above, not really so different to the vast investment we've seen in the Premier League, something which the PL and FA have certainly not been shy about courting, and the media have generally been in favour of.\n\nNote I'm not saying that those found guilty of corruption in the Qatar bid shouldn't be punished, I'm simply trying to point out some double standards in reporting.\n\n\n**Re: the heat**\n\nThis is already an issue in Brazil with a current lawsuit against FIFA by the Brazilian players' union.  It was also an issue in US 1994.  \n\nFurthermore Qatar's bid involved air-conditioned stadia which would then be shipped to other countries - so, if actually achieved, their bid could have done a lot of good for other places, rather than creating 'white elephants' as is the case after many sporting events.   \n\nI'm unaware of any other country or bid to have attempted such a project of 'transportable' stadia - although sadly we can probably assume that the subsequent distribution of the stadia would have been subject to just as much corruption.\n\nBut in any case their bid *could* have been painted in the media as a very ambitious engineering project, rather than simple folly.  I haven't seen the bid videos so I don't know how convincing it was, but if they could achieve this (including moving the stadia afterwards), I don't see anything that is inherently terminal about this aspect of the bid.  \n\nThe Brazil bid in this respect is probably worse, since it had no plans to move the stadia (such as the one in Manaus) afterwards.\n\nI wonder how the Qatar bid was perceived in architectural circles, before any allegations of corruption came out?

Looking at some of the criticism of the Qatar bid:\n\n**Re: 'they're not a football country'**\n\nThe Qatar World Cup bid (and the purchase of PSG) is part of an effort to essentially protect the country by making it highly identified (and 'friendly') to the western world - we have seen exactly the same method employed by for example the Abu Dhabi Group at City, Roman Abramovich at Chelsea, Usmanov at Arsenal, not to mention others of course who have failed miserably such as Venky's at Blackburn, or perhaps Carson Yeung at Birmingham.  \n\n(Remains to be seen of course whether the current corruption allegations and spotlight on labour conditions actually harms their original intent - the case was made in a recent podcast, [*One World Sports AET: The FIFA Politics of Soft Power and Scandal*](http://www.beyondthepitch.net/podcasts/edition/index.cfm/one-world-sports-aet/2014/06/03/), that it's highly probable that it was Western PR agencies who have sold this venture to the Qataris in the first place, promising that they could improve their image and control the Western media spin.)\n\nAnyway when billionaires are using their wealth to fund clubs, many applaud their behaviour as 'simply necessary to break into the elite', or shrug their shoulders, or point out the positive things such investment can bring.  It's a tangential debate, but nevertheless frames the reasons why Qatar bid in the first place.  \n\nIn theory there's nothing wrong with what they are trying to do - and of course the same 'not a footballing country' argument could have been made against USA 1994, or Australia 2022.  \n\nIt also fits with the FIFA remit of globalising football, something which has paid off handsomely for other organisations such as the Man United brand, BSkyB, and of course the Premier League itself.\n\n**Re: the bidding process**\n\nIt certainly appears to have been deeply corrupt, however if it wasn't a Middle Eastern country we might not focus on it so much - the bidding process has likely been very corrupt in most countries for many years.  \n\nI posted yesterday about some of the scandals that occurred in the English approach to their bid, so I won't bother re-posting it now, suffice to say that the English are hardly above this method of influence in politics themselves - in fact currently helping Qatar in their time of 'media spin' troubles is none other than [former head of the FA David Davies](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football//article4108374.ece).\n\nIn addition the recent Olympics in London was prey to ['gravy train' behaviour](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football/article4107289.ece), and of course arguably the biggest sporting-event bidding scandal prior to the recent Qatar allegations [actually came out of the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Winter_Olympic_bid_scandal).\n\nI think there is also possibly some misunderstanding about Platini's involvement.  \n\nPlatini, like Blatter, has based his political power on a platform of inclusion for the 'smaller' countries.  So basically that's his 'campaign promise', and therefore excludes him from backing, for example, the US.  \n\nThe allegation against him is that French president Sarkozy pressured him into a quid-pro-quo vote for Qatar, in order to push for Qatari investment in France (which of course has happened with PSG, not sure about other sectors).  So basically you have a *French* president pressuring a *French* representative to side with the needs of *French* industry.   Even if the allegations are true, for me this doesn't really seem like the crime of the century or anything.\n\nThere is also the side issue of the English media vs Platini.  They seem to hate Platini for several reasons, but one of them is FFP - his attempts to curb spending have been met with much criticism, some justified of course.   \n\nHowever I find this a touch hypocritical, since the Qatari investment in the World Cup is, as I attempted to describe above, not really so different to the vast investment we've seen in the Premier League, something which the PL and FA have certainly not been shy about courting, and the media have generally been in favour of.\n\nNote I'm not saying that those found guilty of corruption in the Qatar bid shouldn't be punished, I'm simply trying to point out some double standards in reporting.\n\n\n**Re: the heat**\n\nThis is already an issue in Brazil with a current lawsuit against FIFA by the Brazilian players' union.  It was also an issue in US 1994.  \n\nFurthermore Qatar's bid involved air-conditioned stadia which would then be shipped to other countries - so, if actually achieved, their bid could have done a lot of good for other places, rather than creating 'white elephants' as is the case after many sporting events.   \n\nI'm unaware of any other country or bid to have attempted such a project of 'transportable' stadia - although sadly we can probably assume that the subsequent distribution of the stadia would have been subject to just as much corruption.\n\nBut in any case their bid *could* have been painted in the media as a very ambitious engineering project, rather than simple folly.  I haven't seen the bid videos so I don't know how convincing it was, but if they could achieve this (including moving the stadia afterwards), I don't see anything that is inherently terminal about this aspect of the bid.  \n\nThe Brazil bid in this respect is probably worse, since it had no plans to move the stadia (such as the one in Manaus) afterwards.\n\nI wonder how the Qatar bid was perceived in architectural circles, before any allegations of corruption came out?  Would be interesting to know the strictly technical views on the topic, rather than political ones.\n\n\n**Re: human rights abuses**\n\nIf we are to consider the human rights issues in Qatar a reason to bar them from hosting the World Cup, we should hold all countries to the same standard.  \n\nIn that case the US for one should certainly never host a sporting event ever again:  *decades* of illegal wars and interference in sovereign democracies, legalised torture, drone killings of civilians without trial, subjugation of its own citizens via the prison-industrial complex, capital punishment, spying and wire-tapping on a massive scale, abuse of migrant workers, and of course its own 'money talks' attitude towards politics with what amounts to legalised bribery in the form of 'lobbying', 'corporate personhood', 'pork', etc.  \n\nI apologise for bringing the politics into this sub and I realise these are complex issues that I am certainly unqualified to comment on - but we cannot hold one country to a high standard while giving others a pass.\n\nAs for the argument that the labour conditions in Qatar affect the WC stadia directly, which is why it's relevant while the various transgressions of other countries are not - that's a fair point I suppose, but in that case issues in Qatar regarding homosexuality and womens' rights etc should not enter the discussion either.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe all have subconscious biases and particularly towards the unknown.

Those cases can hinge on the slightest connection to the United States, like the use of an American bank or Internet service provider.\n\n\n&gt;Switzerland’s treaty with the United States is unusual in that it gives Swiss authorities the power to refuse extradition for tax crimes, but on matters of general criminal law, the Swiss have agreed to turn people over for prosecution in American courts.\n\n\n&gt;Critics of FIFA point to the lack of transparency regarding executive salaries and resource allocations for an organization that, by its own admission, had revenue of $5.7 billion from 2011 to 2014. Policy decisions are also often taken without debate or explanation, and a small group of officials — known as the executive committee — operates with outsize power. FIFA has for years functioned with little oversight and even less transparency. Alexandra Wrage, a governance consultant who once unsuccessfully attempted to help overhaul FIFA’s methods, famously labeled the organization “byzantine and impenetrable.�?\n\n\n&gt;Law enforcement officials said much of the inquiry involves Concacaf, one of the six regional confederations that compose FIFA. Concacaf — which stands for Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football — includes major countries like the United States and Mexico, and also tiny ones like Barbados and Montserrat.\n\n\n&gt;According to the indictment, several international soccer events were tainted by bribes and kickbacks involving media and marketing rights: World Cup qualifiers in the Concacaf region; the Gold Cup, a regional championship tournament; the Concacaf Champions League; the Copa América; and the ASouth American club championship, the Copa Libertadores. The indictment also claims that bribes and kickbacks were found in connection with the selection of the host country for the 2010 World Cup.\n\n\n&gt;Concacaf was led from 1990 to 2011 by Mr. Warner, the longtime head of Trinidad &amp; Tobago’s federation. A key powerbroker in FIFA’s governing executive committee, Mr. Warner had been dogged by accusations of corruption. He was accused of illegally profiting from the resale of tickets to the 2006 World Cup, and of withholding the bonuses of the Trinidad players who participated in that tournament.\n\n\n&gt;Mr. Warner resigned his positions in FIFA, Concacaf and his national association in 2011 amid mounting evidence that he had been part of an attempt to buy the votes of Caribbean federation officials in the 2011 FIFA presidential election. A 2013 Concacaf report also found that he had received tens of millions of dollars in misappropriated funds.\n\n\n&gt;But according to the rules of FIFA at the time, Mr. Warner’s resignation led to the immediate closure of all ethics committee cases against him. “The presumption of innocence is maintained,�? FIFA said in a short statement announcing his departure.\n\n\n&gt;Many observers found the bid process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to be flawed from the start: the decision to award two tournaments at once, critics said, would invite vote-trading and other inducements. Since only the 24 members of the executive committee would decide on the hosts, persuading even a few of them might be enough to swing the vote.\n\n\n&gt;Even before the vote took place, two committee members — Amos Adamu of Nigeria and Reynald Temarii of Tahiti — were suspended after an investigation by The Sunday Times caught both men on tape asking for payments in exchange for their support. It was later revealed by England’s bid chief that four ExCo members had solicited bribes from him for their votes; one asked for $2.5 million, while another, Nicolas Leoz of Paraguay, requested a knighthood.\n\n\n&gt;As new accounts of bribery continued to emerge — a whistleblower who worked for the Qatar bid team claimed that several African officials were paid $1.5 million each to support Qatar — FIFA in 2012 started an investigation of the bid process. It was led by a former United States attorney, Michael J. Garcia, who spent nearly two years compiling a report. That report, however, has never been made public; instead, the top judge on the ethics committee, the German Joachim Eckert, released a summary of the report. In it, he declared that while violations of the code of ethics had occurred, they had not affected the integrity of the vote.\n\n\n&gt;Within hours, Garcia had criticised Eckert’s summary as incorrect and incomplete, charging that it contained “numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts.�? Nonetheless, FIFA moved quickly to embrace the report’s absolution of the bid process. Qatar World Cup officials said the review had upheld “the integrity and quality of our bid,�? And Russia’s sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, told reporters, “I hope we will not have talk about this again.�?\n\n\n&gt;The issue was, in fact, raised against Wednesday. When pressed by reporters at the news conference, Mr. de Gregorio repeatedly said that FIFA would not consider reopening the bid process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.\n\n***\n\n[And here's FIFA's response.](http://i.imgur.com/A6lGjPJ.jpg)\n","duration":"","id":600,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_crmdhxo","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4,"level":5,"title":"FIFA Officials Arrested on Corruption Charges; Sepp Blatter Isn’t Among Them.","label":"ballsywallsy","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_37g3wr","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1432754380,"simScore":0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1432754803,"simScore":0.6675770861267835,"sentiment":"  Positive"},{"index":601,"links":[0],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"dannyaray89","label":"Unfortunately FIFA has already said this won't lead to a revote of either the 2018 (Russia) or 2022 (Qatar) World Cup bids.\r\rPersonally, I'd like to visit both Russia and Qatar sometime anyway.

We've seen van Persie not being able to sprint after a ball around minute 70 and we've also seen a younger player like Shaw having to be subbed off because he was tired after 50 or 60 minutes.\n\nObviously, not all players are equally affected by running and/or sprinting, but isn't it strange that a few players (the most obvious case being Cristiano) don't seem to be affected by that *at all*?

Every little thing helps.

It's extremely likely that all the big clubs, including United, use some sort of technique to enhance the performance of the players, to help them with their concentration, nerves, blood oxygen levels, etc.  These techniques may not be currently illegal (I'm not sure), but are things that most clubs would rather not talk about.

I know I would, but I think it's a interesting dilemma.","duration":"","id":32,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_crmh71t","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4,"level":5,"title":"FIFA Officials Arrested on Corruption Charges; Sepp Blatter Isn’t Among Them.","label":"ballsywallsy","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_37g3wr","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1432754380,"simScore":0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1432764013,"simScore":0.7701420875758611,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1432769428,"simScore":0.7209766247864884,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1432769428,"simScore":0.7009262055275871,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":604,"links":[0],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"feverz","label":"Well hopefully this is the final nail in Blatter's coffin.

So Blatter was obviously aware of it when he stood for reelection, and obviously didn't care. \n\nFIFA can get new sponsors, but it's a huge PR Blow to them if their current sponsors pull out because of ethical concerns.

The sponsors don't care if he is corrupt or not. Chances are, a lot of them are bribing FIFA as well.\n\nWhat is more likely is that someone has come up with hard evidence or someone is willing to testify against him in court about his corruption. There is no other way to explain a such a sudden decision so soon after his election.

Seven Fifa officials have been arrested in Switzerland at the request of the US authorities after they were indicted for corruption. The amounts involved are alleged to be above $150m (£97m).\nHours later, the Swiss authorities launched their own criminal inquiry into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Swiss police raided Fifa's headquarters in Zurich and seized electronic evidence.\n\n\n**Why does this matter?**\n\nFifa is the body responsible for running world football. In recent years it has been dogged by accusations of corruption, particularly the award of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. In December 2014, Fifa chose not to release its own investigation into corruption - which it says exonerates the bidding process. The report's author, American Michael Garcia, resigned.\nThe World Cup is one of the biggest sporting events in the world and generates billions of dollars in revenue. These arrests and investigations cast doubt over the transparency and honesty for the process of allocating the last three tournaments.\n\n\n**The two inquiries**\n\nThe American indictments - which focus on corruption allegations going back to 1991 - are the most serious, as they could potentially lead to prison terms. As well as the seven people arrested in Zurich, indictments were issued for seven others.\nThe Swiss criminal case is still at the investigative stage but could provide revelations about the allocation of the forthcoming World Cups. It is the first time that authorities with the power to prosecute have looked at the bids. However, in their statement the Swiss make it clear that Fifa are actually the \"injured party\". This means that they are investigating individuals who might have abused the bidding process and used it for money laundering.\n\n\n**Who's accused of corruption?**\n\nThe most senior figures arrested at the request of US authorities are football powerbrokers in North America, Latin America and the Caribbean.\nThey are connected to Concacaf (the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football), which is part of Fifa - essentially it is in charge of football in that region. One of its key roles is helping to agree World Cup TV and sponsorship deals in the US.\nJeffrey Webb is the head of Concacaf and was widely seen as being groomed as a successor to Fifa president Sepp Blatter - indeed, Mr Blatter had said as much. His predecessor Jack Warner has also been indicted. Mr Webb replaced Mr Warner after he was forced to step down after a fraud inquiry.\nA key figure appears to be Charles \"Chuck\" Blazer, US soccer's former representative to Fifa, who has reportedly turned supergrass for the FBI. He has pleaded guilty and already repaid $1.9m.\nThe other men arrested are Fifa officials from Central and South America.\n\n\n**Has Sepp Blatter been arrested?**\n\nNo. The Fifa president and most powerful man in football is not named in the US indictments. However, they do say those arrested were working as part of Fifa - of which he is head. So far he has made no statement.\nHe was recently forced to deny reports that he was avoiding travel to the United States because he feared arrest.\n\n\n**Why were the officials arrested?**\n\nThe FBI has been investigating Fifa for the past three years. The investigations were initially sparked by the bidding process for the Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022 World Cups, but was widened to look back at Fifa's dealings over the past 20 years.\nThe Department of Justice's indictment says that the corruption was planned in the US, even if it was then carried out elsewhere. The use of US banks to transfer money appears to be key to the investigation.\n\n\n**Why Switzerland?**\n\nIt is the home of Fifa, with the company's registration as a charity allowing it to pay little tax.\nSwitzerland might be perceived as a country where less than transparent companies are welcome, particularly when it comes to tax, but its extradition agreement with the US is clear that it will hand over people for criminal acts.\nIt appears that US authorities took advantage of the fact that Fifa's annual Congress brought together key suspects in an extradition-friendly country.\n\n\n**How much money is involved?**\n\nMassive amounts, allegedly.\nThe US indictment alleges over $150m in corruption, and that does not include other possible corruption around the world. An earlier Fifa report into Caribbean corruption, which was leaked, alleged that bribes of $40,000 were handed to officials in cash-stuffed envelopes.\nFifa makes nearly all its revenue from the World Cup, the most lucrative sporting event in the world, eclipsing even the Olympics. Last year's tournament cost the host country Brazil an estimated $4bn, and yet Fifa made more than $2bn in profit. The costs of the next two World Cups are expected to dwarf this: Qatar 2022 is reported to be above $6bn.\nJust bidding for the right to host the World Cup is enormous - the English FA spent £21m on its failed bid for the 2018 tournament.\n\n\n**Will the Russia 2018 or Qatar 2022 World Cup be moved?**\n\nUnlikely but not impossible at this point.\nThe US indictments focus on historical corruption - the selection of South Africa as the 2010 World Cup host is mentioned - but not the forthcoming world cups. The Swiss investigations into those tournaments might prove more fruitful, but it would take overwhelming evidence to run the bidding process again.\nPractically, moving the 2018 Russia World Cup would be fraught with difficulty. Very few countries have the stadiums, infrastructure or money to host the event at such short notice. Even most English stadiums would need a major refurbishment to meet Fifa standards. Germany offers the best option, having hosted the 2006 World Cup.\nQatar is far more vulnerable and has been dogged with controversy and allegations of corruption ever since its award. However, having seen out several corruption scandals, an unprecedented move from a summer to winter tournament and a scandal over the treatment of migrant workers, the odds are it will somehow hold onto football's most illustrious competition.\n\n\n**Will Sepp Blatter still win a fifth term as president?**\n\nThe election is on Friday and he was widely expected to win, but the latest events could change everything. Mr Blatter has the support of Africa and Asia - the two big voting blocs needed to win an election. The question is whether, in the next 48 hours, people will be tempted to switch sides to the only challenger, Prince Ali bin al-Hussein.\nThere will be intense lobbying now among the 209-member associations. There is huge appetite amongst the European nations for change at the top, but whether they can convince the rest of the world remains to be seen.\n\n**tl;dr**, FIFA has been corrupt for years. The US and Switzerland have launched inquires into the corruption which has consisted of several arrests of high profile FIFA officials. \nDespite this, Sepp Blatter is likely to still be crowned FIFA President for the 5th time on Friday....Fuck Sepp Blatter\n\nsource: BBC\n\n\n**Updates that alter previous information** ^(disclaimer: my reporting of events might not be completely unbias)\n\n* Sepp Blatter releases [statement](http://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2015/m=5/news=statement-by-fifa-president-blatter-2609360.html). tl;dr, bullshit, bullshit, corporate pr bullshit ( thanks to /u/powersnake )\n\n* Sepp Blatter gives statement at opening of FIFA Congress.

The document, \"10vor10\" exclusively present, shows for the first time, as Fifa boss Sepp Blatter has been involved in a questionable deal. Blatter sold TV rights far below the market value of Jack Warner, president of the Caribbean Football Association. The process could be criminally relevant.\n&gt; \n&gt; The date of the contract September 12, 2005. Among the two parties FIFA and CFU.\n&gt; \n&gt; That is the agreement of 12 September 2005 with the two parties: the world football governing body FIFA and the Caribbean Association of CFU. SRF\n&gt; Signed the deal in 2005 by FIFA President Sepp Blatter has personally. The beneficiaries of the contract is Jack Warner, president of the Caribbean Football Association. The broadcasting rights for the World Cup in South Africa sold Blatter to Jack Warner for 250,000 dollars that transmission rights for the World Cup in Brazil for 350,000 dollars.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Australian entrepreneur Jaimie Fuller has one year ago established the Fifa-critical group \"New Fifa Now\". For Fuller, the selling price of the TV rights is much too low, \"This is only about five percent of fair market value,\" Fuller says in \"10vor10\" interview.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Jack Warner earned millions**\n&gt;\n&gt; The former football official Jack Warner belonged until 2011 to the highest Fifa circles. He took advantage of the contract for a good deal. After FIFA had the Caribbean Football Association sold the rights for a total of 600,000 US dollars, Association President Jack Warner transferred the rights to his own company. This sold the media rights to the 2007 TV channels SportsMax.\n\n&gt; Among other things, this meeting also a Reconnaissance Report of the Football Association North and Central America and the Caribbean, Concacaf. It is mentioned, Jack Warner had sold the TV rights in 2007 for several million. Estimates of media go from 15 to 20 million dollars.\n&gt; \n&gt; The TV rights were apparently sold way too cheap. For a law professor and corruption expert Monika Roth behavior Blatter could be criminally relevant: \"I am thinking of the offense of breach of trust,\" says Roth. The deal raises the question whether the price was a friendship or a commercially correctly calculated price.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Blatter's individual signature**\n&gt;\n&gt; Sepp Blatter sold the TV rights on behalf of Fifa. With individual signature. He is personally involved. \"It is the first concrete evidence that Sepp Blatter is caught in something,\" said Fifa critic Jaimie Fuller, \"Until now, we only knew that he like a spider in a web of corruption sitting. But here is it his name. \"\n&gt; \n&gt; Because of the deal with Jack Warner Sepp Blatter could come to the attention of law enforcement agencies. Law professor Monika Roth explains that dishonesty was a Offizialdelikt: \"This means that the prosecution must intervene ex officio in any case,\" says Roth, the Federal Prosecutor's Office took on request of \"10vor10\" no position \"the Attorney General shall determine.\".\n&gt; \n&gt; **No comment at the FIFA**\n&gt;\n&gt; The Fifa refused to answer any specific questions about the case and wrote only: \"The Fifa is no comment on the press raised accusations from. Furthermore, we are not authorized to discuss matters pertaining to Mr. Warner, since this is under indictment in the United States. \"On the role of Sepp Blatter, FIFA does not want to express. Although the first time a document is on the table, which shows that Blatter himself was involved in a questionable deal.\n\nUpdate - This is, in fact, old news from September 2011:\n\n&gt; ***FIFA ends Warner TV deal***\n&gt;\n&gt; FIFA has terminated a multi-million pound 2014 World Cup TV deal after discovering the rights had been sub-licensed to a company owned by controversial former vice-president Jack Warner. \n&gt; \n&gt; The agreement with the Caribbean Football Union (CFU) has been brought to an end after FIFA told the organisation it had not approved the sub-licensing deal with Warner's company, JD International (JDI). \n&gt; \n&gt; Warner, who was at that time also the CFU president, sold the rights to Jamaica-based cable provider SportsMax in 2007 for a fee reported to be between US$18 million and US$20 million, though that included the 2010 World Cup as well. \n&gt; \n&gt; FIFA was also owed several payments dating back to 2009 for the rights, which covered 29 Caribbean countries. \n&gt; \n&gt; Warner resigned from all football activities in June, a month after being charged with bribery by FIFA, which then dropped its investigation saying it no longer had jurisdiction over the Trinidadian. \n&gt; \n&gt; FIFA has sent a letter to the CFU saying they have \"only recently become aware\" of the sub-licensing agreement, as well as detailing the missed payments, and terminating the contract. \n&gt; \n&gt; Warner has claimed that FIFA's action is \"designed to go after me\" and that he was shocked that the CFU had been targeted. \n&gt; \n&gt; FIFA said in a statement to the British Press Association: \"The CFU was a media rights licensee for FIFA events in selected territories in the Caribbean. \n&gt; \n&gt; \"However, CFU is no longer a media rights licensee of FIFA. FIFA has secured good coverage in the region directly, but has still not finalised any announcement.\" \n&gt; \n&gt; Conservative MP Damian Collins, who is campaigning for FIFA reforms, said Warner's involvement pointed to a clear conflict of interest. \n&gt; \n&gt; The initial contract with the CFU was agreed in 2005 giving the organisation the rights for the 2010 and 2014 World Cups for countries in the Caribbean. \n&gt; \n&gt; The CFU, headed by Warner, sub-licensed the rights to his company JDI. In 2007, JDI sold on those rights to SportsMax. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; FIFA has said it had not approved the sub-licensing and had only become aware of it recently, but there was no secrecy about Warner's involvement. \n&gt; \n&gt; Indeed he held a photo opportunity with SportsMax executives to announce the deal, and according to SportsMax's own website, the deal was worth between US$18-20 million. \n&gt; \n&gt; The website said Warner \"negotiated the deal on behalf of JDI\" and \"in his capacity as president of the CFU\". \n&gt; \n&gt; Collins, who sits on the culture, media and sport committee, said the reforms to be announced by FIFA president Sepp Blatter needed to address conflicts of interest. \n&gt; \n&gt; He said: \"There should be a very strict code where members of FIFA's executive committee have to declare all their financial interests. \n&gt; \n&gt; \"If it looks like senior officials are making money on the side as a result of their role in football, that is plainly wrong. \n&gt; \n&gt; \"For someone who has responsibility for the game of football to be making money out of the exploitation of that game cannot be right.\" \n&gt; \n&gt; Warner's close connections to the television rights in the Caribbean were also revealed by former FA chairman Lord Triesman in his claims about improper approaches during England's 2018 World Cup bid—Triesman said Warner asked for US$500,000 to be channelled through him to buy the television rights to show the 2010 World Cup on big screens in earthquake-hit Haiti. \n&gt; \n&gt; Warner said FIFA's action against the CFU was a publicity stunt. \n&gt; \n&gt; He told the Press Association: \"Such ignoble pursuit has nothing to do with the cleansing of corruption within the FIFA but rather to offer the perception of an aura of cleansing within the FIFA. \n&gt; \n&gt; \"The matter is designed to go after me...and is now with the CFU's Swiss lawyers.\" \n\nSourced from: http://www.trinidadexpress.com/sports/FIFA_ends_Warner_TV_deal-129507108.html\n\n","selftextHTML":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.srf.ch/news/allgemeines/blatter-verkaufte-tv-rechte-weit-unter-dem-marktpreis\"&gt;http://www.srf.ch/news/allgemeines/blatter-verkaufte-tv-rechte-weit-unter-dem-marktpreis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://s2.srfcdn.ch/images/auftritte/news/bilder/2015/09/11/node_8015854/96172144-2-ger-DE/bild_s8.jpg\"&gt;http://s2.srfcdn.ch/images/auftritte/news/bilder/2015/09/11/node_8015854/96172144-2-ger-DE/bild_s8.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http://s1.srfcdn.ch/images/auftritte/news/bilder/2015/09/11/node_8015754/96171024-2-ger-DE/bild_s8.jpg\"&gt;http://s1.srfcdn.ch/images/auftritte/news/bilder/2015/09/11/node_8015754/96171024-2-ger-DE/bild_s8.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http://s2.srfcdn.ch/images/auftritte/news/bilder/2015/09/11/node_8015764/96171059-2-ger-DE/bild_s8.jpg\"&gt;http://s2.srfcdn.ch/images/auftritte/news/bilder/2015/09/11/node_8015764/96171059-2-ger-DE/bild_s8.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http://s1.srfcdn.ch/images/auftritte/news/bilder/2015/09/11/node_8015829/96171284-2-ger-DE/bild_s8.jpg\"&gt;http://s1.srfcdn.ch/images/auftritte/news/bilder/2015/09/11/node_8015829/96171284-2-ger-DE/bild_s8.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The document, &amp;quot;10vor10&amp;quot; exclusively present, shows for the first time, as Fifa boss Sepp Blatter has been involved in a questionable deal. Blatter sold TV rights far below the market value of Jack Warner, president of the Caribbean Football Association. The process could be criminally relevant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The date of the contract September 12, 2005. Among the two parties FIFA and CFU.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is the agreement of 12 September 2005 with the two parties: the world football governing body FIFA and the Caribbean Association of CFU. SRF\nSigned the deal in 2005 by FIFA President Sepp Blatter has personally. The beneficiaries of the contract is Jack Warner, president of the Caribbean Football Association. The broadcasting rights for the World Cup in South Africa sold Blatter to Jack Warner for 250,000 dollars that transmission rights for the World Cup in Brazil for 350,000 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Australian entrepreneur Jaimie Fuller has one year ago established the Fifa-critical group &amp;quot;New Fifa Now&amp;quot;. For Fuller, the selling price of the TV rights is much too low, &amp;quot;This is only about five percent of fair market value,&amp;quot; Fuller says in &amp;quot;10vor10&amp;quot; interview.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jack Warner earned millions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The former football official Jack Warner belonged until 2011 to the highest Fifa circles. He took advantage of the contract for a good deal. After FIFA had the Caribbean Football Association sold the rights for a total of 600,000 US dollars, Association President Jack Warner transferred the rights to his own company. This sold the media rights to the 2007 TV channels SportsMax.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Among other things, this meeting also a Reconnaissance Report of the Football Association North and Central America and the Caribbean, Concacaf. It is mentioned, Jack Warner had sold the TV rights in 2007 for several million. Estimates of media go from 15 to 20 million dollars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The TV rights were apparently sold way too cheap. For a law professor and corruption expert Monika Roth behavior Blatter could be criminally relevant: &amp;quot;I am thinking of the offense of breach of trust,&amp;quot; says Roth. The deal raises the question whether the price was a friendship or a commercially correctly calculated price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blatter&amp;#39;s individual signature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sepp Blatter sold the TV rights on behalf of Fifa. With individual signature. He is personally involved. &amp;quot;It is the first concrete evidence that Sepp Blatter is caught in something,&amp;quot; said Fifa critic Jaimie Fuller, &amp;quot;Until now, we only knew that he like a spider in a web of corruption sitting. But here is it his name. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of the deal with Jack Warner Sepp Blatter could come to the attention of law enforcement agencies. Law professor Monika Roth explains that dishonesty was a Offizialdelikt: &amp;quot;This means that the prosecution must intervene ex officio in any case,&amp;quot; says Roth, the Federal Prosecutor&amp;#39;s Office took on request of &amp;quot;10vor10&amp;quot; no position &amp;quot;the Attorney General shall determine.&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No comment at the FIFA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Fifa refused to answer any specific questions about the case and wrote only: &amp;quot;The Fifa is no comment on the press raised accusations from. Furthermore, we are not authorized to discuss matters pertaining to Mr. Warner, since this is under indictment in the United States. &amp;quot;On the role of Sepp Blatter, FIFA does not want to express. Although the first time a document is on the table, which shows that Blatter himself was involved in a questionable deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update - This is, in fact, old news from September 2011:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;FIFA ends Warner TV deal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FIFA has terminated a multi-million pound 2014 World Cup TV deal after discovering the rights had been sub-licensed to a company owned by controversial former vice-president Jack Warner. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The agreement with the Caribbean Football Union (CFU) has been brought to an end after FIFA told the organisation it had not approved the sub-licensing deal with Warner&amp;#39;s company, JD International (JDI). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Warner, who was at that time also the CFU president, sold the rights to Jamaica-based cable provider SportsMax in 2007 for a fee reported to be between US$18 million and US$20 million, though that included the 2010 World Cup as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FIFA was also owed several payments dating back to 2009 for the rights, which covered 29 Caribbean countries. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Warner resigned from all football activities in June, a month after being charged with bribery by FIFA, which then dropped its investigation saying it no longer had jurisdiction over the Trinidadian. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FIFA has sent a letter to the CFU saying they have &amp;quot;only recently become aware&amp;quot; of the sub-licensing agreement, as well as detailing the missed payments, and terminating the contract. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Warner has claimed that FIFA&amp;#39;s action is &amp;quot;designed to go after me&amp;quot; and that he was shocked that the CFU had been targeted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FIFA said in a statement to the British Press Association: &amp;quot;The CFU was a media rights licensee for FIFA events in selected territories in the Caribbean. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;However, CFU is no longer a media rights licensee of FIFA.
