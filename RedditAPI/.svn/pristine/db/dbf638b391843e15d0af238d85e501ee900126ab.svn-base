There is nothing to suggest that Obama is an atheist. He was raised Christian, raised his daughters Christian, attended church regularly.  If he's an atheist, then so is McCain, Trump, and Clinton. 
It's true that all politicians claim to have some faith.  Obama has a more convincing history of attending than many others. 
Ben Carson.  

About 40% of college faculty are religious.  Considering he regularly attended church and was raised Christian, I would believe that he is.  
Yes, U.S.  I was assuming that was the context since we are talking about the U.S. President. 
Sure, you can doubt he is Christian, but also that Mitt Romney is Mormon or that Rick Santorum is Catholic. Of all the politicians one might suspect, Obama sure does have a lot of history with going to church, being raised in a religious household, and using religious rhetoric in his speeches. 
I can buy that somewhat.  But the catch is that more people responded that Obama was foreign born than responded that Ted Cruz was.  At the very least, it shows a significant a lack of knowledge.
But we're they also trolling when more respondents said Cruz was born in the U.S.?
Considering how much traction Trump got in 2011 over the issue, I wouldn't dismiss it as GOP trolling the pollsters.
I'm quite certain a significant portion of /r/conservative thinks he is Muslim. They make posts and comments insinuating that quite a bit.
