Sure, if you compare what the final output is, he doesn\u0027t look much better, but you need to consider input as well. The middle east was largely stable -- though brutal -- before the Iraq War: Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya were all known quantities with generally powerful governments, able to maintain order, or a decent enough approximation thereof, in their respective countries. After the Iraq War, Iraq lost the only entity able to keep three relatively distant groups (Kurds, Sunnis, Shias) under the rule of a single government. The power vacuum was not able to be filled with the institution of a democratic government that doesn\u0027t fix the distances between those groups.\n\nSimultaneously, many other countries in the region underwent revolutions -- violent or peaceful -- that saw the end of the rule, or end of that ruler\u0027s de facto power. Whether those revolutions can be traced back to the problems of the Iraq War is something I\u0027ve read little about, but it seems like there is at least some room to relate the two, but there\u0027s also room to argue that they could have happened anyway -- regardless, they did happen, and would not have been preventable with further US action in the region.\n\nObama was elected at a time when the region had a giant, still unresolved, power vacuum in one of the two larger regional powers, with many other countries on the verge of creating similar power vacuums: under those conditions, he has worked with the limited resources available (because so many had been used up in the prior decade; were committed elsewhere; and/or lacked public support to use) to him to mitigate those problems, while also working to strengthen (well, sort of) some groups (e.g. the Kurds in Iraq) that could hopefully allow larger chunks of the region to be more stable in the longterm.\n\nOn the flipside, Bush was elected at a time when the region was largely stable and not on the verge of going into further issues.\n\nComparing the two based on the input and output, Obama has done significantly better on the region. That\u0027s not to say I don\u0027t have lots of criticisms for him (oh man do I have criticisms!) but instead to merely say that, despite the presence of many problems, the actual value-add of Obama is significantly higher (in that it is actually positive) than the value-add of Bush (in that it is negative) for outcomes in the region.","duration":"","id":7,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_clakerd","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":6,"links":[4],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"BroBeansBMS","label":"To be fair, has Obama done much better?","duration":"","id":6,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_clajnc9","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":4,"links":[3],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"--Kai--","label":"How dare you speak against the great Tony Blair and George Bush, after all the good they\u0027ve done to create lasting peace in the middle east! /sarcasm","duration":"","id":4,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_clafipt","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":3,"links":[2],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"AveSharia","label":"I think he\u0027s claiming Bush killed a few hundred thousand.
