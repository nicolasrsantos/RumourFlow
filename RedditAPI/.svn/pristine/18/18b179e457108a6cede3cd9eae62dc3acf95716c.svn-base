They are merely facts that I have come across and watched.  Take it as food for thought. Try to find facts that disprove the statements.\n\n**Evidence supporting 9/11 plan by govt**\n-If you preview videos from 9/11, you will in fact see small explosions from the sides of the buildings as the tower(s) collapsed. It is possible that they could have planted bombs in buildings before collapse to bring down the building and let it fall the way it did\n-Buildings fell straight down, although if had fell by being impacted, it would have fell to the side similar to a tree being cut with an ax. Symmetrical fall from asymmetrical damage not realistic.\n-Buildings fell at a free fall velocity\n-No other buildings have ever fell not collapsed from fire, definitely  not as the WTCs did. They burned for 1-2 hours(can\u0027t exit out of iPod to get exact time.), respectively, and collapsed. A tower in France burned for 3 days, and did not collapse at all whatsoever.Empire state building has also been hit twice by planes (one in 50s, one in 80s) and also burned for days without collapsing.\n-Any remnants of flight 93 could not be found. Only a small (hole?) in the ground not even large enough to be passed as a commercial airplane. When an object hits the ground at a high velocity, the crater is usually larger than the object. To see how this works, throw a marble in sand. \n- No bodies could be recovered from the site of flight 93 crash. Extremely unusual, (this might be wrong, I can\u0027t research it again right now. Sincere apologies) there was a cross continental flight that was destroyed over the ocean, likely an explosion, and we managed to recover most if not all bodies.\n-And yes, absolutely nothing hit WTC7 and it collapsed\n-The plane hit the pentagon in area of least people. If not no people. I can\u0027t remember if there were supposed to be people in the area or if it was a typically empty area. Either way, it\u0027s fishy. It also left no actual hole. The biggest hole they could find was barely bigger than a tall person. \n\nFeel free to add to the list, etc. it\u0027s good to be able to analyze and / or disprove facts so that you can form your own opinion. Most people assume it was terrorists just because the government says so. I want you to be able to know it was terrorists because of research, not from hearing things.\n","duration":"","id":35,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c66qlp0","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"ELI5 - 9/11 conspiracy theories","label":"hammeresq","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_zpw43","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.347414555E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.34742097E9,"simScore":0.72056905233789,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},{"index":36,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"istalkezreddit","label":"How did [these guys](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dzx9q5N8iV68) KNOW that there would be an \"event\" to film?","duration":"","id":36,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c676x89","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"ELI5 - 9/11 conspiracy theories","label":"hammeresq","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_zpw43","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.347414555E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.347501177E9,"simScore":0.7448750026524067,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":37,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"paranoidpriceisright","label":"I don\u0027t even care about WTC 1 \u0026amp; 2 - WTC 7 is what made me question.
