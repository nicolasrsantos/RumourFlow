Societies DO NOT progress over time, time just passes, and they change in one direction or another. Morality today is degeneracy tomorrow, and so on and so forth. Probably a good half of modern morals that we trumpet now will be considered on par with slavery in the future.

He's fairly honest really. But in reality, they're voting for him because he dares to be openly nationalist, and they can't stand the shit storm he's receiving for doing so. I don't support Trump, but I do hate that every time he's says something that's just plain nationalistic, it makes every headline as somehow racist or bigoted in some manner as though nationalism is inherently evil. That's what unites Trump supporters, not this Kenya crap. 
Is this not satire?

Wow, what are the fuckin chances
