Racism is not really an issue in England, class warfare is much more prevalent. It\u0027s the sort of situation where if you are middle class it doesn\u0027t matter whether you are white or black but on the other hand middle class and working class people of the same race is not doable.\n\nMentalities are changing now, damn even the princes are married to women that aren\u0027t royalty. Still though the class warfare thing is held up by some stubborn individuals.\n\nI was considered middle class growing up because we come from a family of property owners and my friends were all white and I was accepted like another friend. On the other hand when I moved to the north of England and starting living around people of various races who were working class I used to get picked on, not necessarily in a nasty way but still they made it clear I was a \"posh git\" lol.\n\nHmm sounds like your coming onto me lol. I am assuming you are American. The relationship the Italians and Irish had in early America was an interesting one. I would imagine if your grandparents were the ones coming from different backgrounds then they might have felt some racism as well.\n\nIt\u0027s actually quite amusing isn\u0027t it. I mean look at England. It\u0027s not English when the bloody Romans invaded and then the Normans invaded. About 90% of the population have either Roman or Norman genes in them. Then you take the Anglo-Danes and they bred into the population too. Apart from perhaps a few hundred thousand people in Wales practically everybody is already \"mixed\" race and it\u0027s actually common in most places.\n\nMaybe our ancestors were arguing \"Look at that half English half Danish git.. this is disgraceful\", now nobody bats an eyelid. Perhaps one day we will all be multiracial and biege and nobody will bother with racism.\n\nWe will progress from racism and class warfare to picking on people because of their height. There will be the short dwarf like people and the tall elf like people.
