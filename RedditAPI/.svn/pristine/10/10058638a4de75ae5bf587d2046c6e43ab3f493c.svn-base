The temperatures reached in the fires would be hot enough to soften the structural steel IF it were in a blast furnace and IF the steel was a relatively small piece. The interlocking steel framework of the buildings acted as a heat sink and dissipated so much of the heat that the steel retained nearly all of its structural integrity. This doesn\u0027t even take into account the fact that the structures were designed to support a minimum of 2 times the actual weight of anything above. Even if the supports lost 50% of their integrity the buildings would still stand. \n\nThen there\u0027s the issue of photographic evidence of steel that had actually melted. This would require localized temperatures much, much higher leading to the suggestion that thermite may have been the cause. The molten pools of steel lasting weeks after the collapses were more evidence of that.\n\nConcerning Flight 93, I think the general consensus amongst truthers is that the passengers actually did retake control of the plane and that the plane was then shot down resulting in the wreckage being spread out over an area eight miles long.\n\nThe best information about all of this can be found at:\n\n[Pilots for 9/11 Truth](http://pilotsfor911truth.org/)\n\n[Architects \u0026amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth](http://www.ae911truth.org/)\n\n[History Commons - Complete 9/11 Timeline](http://www.historycommons.org/project.jsp?project\u003d911_project)","duration":"","id":29,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_c4gwndp","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":28,"links":[27],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"planeboy24","label":"i hate when people respond like that. its basically saying that you dont have an answer. i would love if someone proved me wrong or could bring about points to really make me think about things. theres plenty of lose ends that people refuse to acknowledge because its easier for them to accept that some meanies over yonder did this because they dont like us for some reason than to know that our own government thats supposed to protect us is actually just using us as numbers in order to start a so called \"war on terrorism\" so they can get control of the oil or who knows what the real reasons are. theres no such thing as a war on terrorism. the real terrorism is what the government is doing to its own people. the exact definition of terrorism is \"The use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims.\" i will leave you redditors at that","duration":"","id":28,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_c4gqaov","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":27,"links":[26],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"BrowncoatsUnite","label":"Please don\u0027t feed the trolls.","duration":"","id":27,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_c4gq0iz","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":26,"links":[24],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"planeboy24","label":"Ok.

So, from their very own \"[smoking gun](http://www.ae911truth.org/en/news-section/41-articles/344-building-7-implosion-the-smoking-gun-of-911.html)\":\n\nBasic factual error:\n\u0026gt;For the observed straight-down collapse to happen, an immense network of heavy steel columns and beams would have had to be forcibly removed and more than 400 structural-steel connections would have had to fail every second, evenly, all across each of the eight floors involved.\n\nActual Fact:\n\n[Building 7 did not fall straight down.](http://www.debunking911.com/barclay.jpg) Rather, it split at the penthouse, with part of the building going to the South-East, and another part going to the North.  What we can see in this photo I provided is that Building Seven collapsed all over Barclay street--[and as this picture demonstrates](http://www.debunking911.com/b7debris.jpg), it had tilted so far to the South-East that in the collapse, debris managed to get all over the white building across Barclay street.  \n\nIn other words, Building 7 DID NOT FALL STRAIGHT DOWN.\n\n\nAwful analytic work:\n\n\u0026gt;Prior to the NIST investigation, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), had conducted a preliminary, cursory, underfunded investigation and produced a Building Performance Assessment Report. In Appendix C of that report, FEMA described its analysis of only two steel samples, one from Building 7 and the other from Tower 1 or 2. The analysis of the WTC 7 sample showed “evidence of a severe high temperature corrosion attack on the steel, including rapid oxidation and sulfidation with subsequent intergranular melting….”\n\n\u0026gt;“A liquid eutectic mixture containing primarily iron, oxygen, and sulfur formed during this hot corrosion attack on the steel.”... “No clear explanation for the source of the sulfur has been identified.” The New York Times called this “perhaps the deepest mystery uncovered in the investigation.” What did NIST say in its Final Report about this mystery described by FEMA? Nothing – there was no mention of this crucial evidence at all. It was excluded.\n\n\u0026gt;Neither jet fuel nor office fires can reach anywhere close to steel’s melting point, much less its evaporation point, even if those critical temperatures had been lowered  by the presence of free sulfur. So what could have caused this “high temperature corrosion attack?”\n\nGood analysis:\n\nJonathan Barnett at FEMA studied two pieces of sulfidized steel, which is not enough to explain the collapse. NIST determined that neither piece came from a supporting column in the collapse zone so it couldn’t have contributed to the collapse. Sulfidized steel melts at temperatures 1000° lower than regular steel so it could have “melted” in a regular office fire. And the “intergranular melting” FEMA discovered is not like melting as we know it anyway; it’s more like corrosion on an almost microscopic scale occurring along the boundaries between the crystals or grains of a metal. The technical description for what happened is “intergranular melting, high temperature corrosion via sulphidation, oxidation, and decarburisation leading to a liquid Iron Oxide Suflur mix from grain boundary melting.”\n\n[Further, they totally ignore a variety of likely causes of the introduction of sulfur.](http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html)  They don\u0027t even discuss them.  Why?  Because it cripples their innuendo laden, poorly constructed argument.\n\nAs for a misrepresentation of authoritativeness:  The mere fact that they tout their employment, and then fail to address the fact that hundreds of thousands of other engineers and architects think they\u0027re a bunch of loons.\n\nFurther, the above critique of their analysis shows that, not only do they have no idea what they are talking about, but that they are ridiculously uninquisutive in regards to their own arguments.  \n\nAnd persecution complex?  Right from their front page, they quote Einstein:\n\n\"Condemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance.\"\n\nThe crux of the issue is, though, that people who oppose them have investigated the matter, and found how fraught their claims are.  The fact that they find it astonishing that anyone could disagree with them and their abysmal evidence, that they must do so out of ignorance, indicates a persecution complex.  A messiah complex typical of conspiracy crazies.  \n\nHarumph.  \n","duration":"","id":68,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_c4i5vds","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":67,"links":[66],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"ExtHD","label":"\u0026gt;disregard or misrepresent objective facts\n\n[Citation needed]\n\u0026gt;weakness of the causal links in their analysis\n\n[Citation needed]\n\u0026gt;misrepresentation of the authoritativeness\n\n[Citation needed]\n\u0026gt;persecution complex\n\n[Citation needed]\n\nAnd by \"citation\" I mean proof, not someone\u0027s opinion.","duration":"","id":67,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_c4hc671","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":66,"links":[65],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"IAmNotYourBoss","label":"Their willingness to disregard or misrepresent objective facts; the weakness of the causal links in their analysis; the frequent misrepresentation of the authoritativeness of their combined professional credentials, mixed with the persecution complex.","duration":"","id":66,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_c4h8f3c","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":65,"links":[64],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"wodniwtnuocsid","label":"\u0026gt;whose lack of quality is apparent  \n\nHow so?","duration":"","id":65,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_c4h7qcs","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":64,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"iamnotyourboss","label":"Further, we can see that it is completely possible, given a large enough pool of participants, to have a limited number express an absolutely deluded position, without any real, documentary evidence.

Islamic terrorists were behind attacks and planes brought down Twin Towers (no controlled demolition). 90% agree with official account outright. 10% think building 7 was or might\u0027ve been intentionally demolished. 5% side with conspiracists.\n\nThere was considerable debate, but most joked and outright mocked the the conspiracy theories and AE911truth. Of the 25 respondents who gave clear, categorizable opinions, 24 agreed the Twin Towers came down as an ultimate consequence of the aircraft impacts, and that Islamic terrorists were to blame. Most of the 24 identified themselves as architects or building engineers. Only one respondent seemed to side with the conspiracists, posting a Youtube link to the conspiracy video \"Loose Change\", but never saying anything more or stating their credentials.\n\nI always figured support among experts for the conspiracy theorists must be very low, since you would expect far more signatories than AE911truth claims. After all, by their own logic, these are the people who should be least likely to believe the official account and most supportive of an alternate explanation. Yet the reality is completely the opposite. Out of the roughly 2 million architects and engineers in the U.S. alone, less than one in a thousand have signed the AE911truth petition.
