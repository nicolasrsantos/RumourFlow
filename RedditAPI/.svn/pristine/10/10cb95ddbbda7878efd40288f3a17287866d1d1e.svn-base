Yeah, but Muslims would usually use "Inshallah" instead of the English. Does Conservapedia have an article on Crypto-Muslim (ie, someone who is secretly Muslim) yet? Someone should get on it. Serious Poe-tential...
Exactly. The guys who led the revolt against the British were all "terrorists". And in other news, presumption of guilt (not innocence) was a foundation for the Australian state...
Agreed, but lighten up... these people you're describing are getting the ridicule they deserve here. It seems that puncturing their ridiculous falsehoods through satire is working quite well...
Have you ever seen a commie drink a glass of water? Didn't think so! Fluoridation, my friend!
Ewwww... just discovered that Conservepedia uses the abbreviation CP to describe itself. Nasty, nasty, nasty.
