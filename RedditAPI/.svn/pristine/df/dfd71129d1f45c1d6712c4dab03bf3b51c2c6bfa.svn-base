I spent several years managing airport security ops for a number of airlines at a couple of \u0027hot\u0027 Asian airports.\n\n\u0026gt;Therefore, I will restrict my comments to the case-solving and AVSEC side of these events concerning MH370. First up, common sense and logic invariably worm best when trying to figure out these cases. Somebody, somewhere, knows a lot more than they are letting on for public consumption and I\u0027d wager that various nations and agencies are not sharing what they know with the others involved.\n\n\u0026gt;**A large object, such as a B777 cannot simply disappear without somebody having some knowledge of its last known whereabouts. Failure to plot it on military radar seems highly unlikely. Failure to share that information seems rather more likely. In a busy shipping area it also seems highly unlikely that somebody wouldn\u0027t have seen something.**\n\n\u0026gt;It seems highly unlikely that it could have evaded detection and landed somewhere after a highjacking. First, it would need a considerable runway to accommodate it and, second, it would have had to overfly a hefty chunk of land and somebody would most likely have seen something.\n\n\u0026gt;It seems much more likely, unfortunately, that it has gone down somewhere and the fact that nothing at all of it has been found strongly indicates that the search is not being conducted in the right area.\n\n\u0026gt;That brings back round the loop to the failure of parties to share what they know of its whereabouts from various military and government services who track even the smallest of aircraft flying in airspace around their nations\u0027 borders.\n\n\u0026gt;But there is pretty much no other logical conclusion that they are looking in the wrong places.\n\n[Source](http://www.pprune.org/rumours-news/535538-malaysian-airlines-mh370-contact-lost-71.html#post8364561)","duration":"","id":136,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cfzv280","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"So the missing Malaysian Airlines MH370 flight is getting stranger every day, Passengers cell phone is still connected,","label":"bigbrownbeav","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_2036r3","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.394520769E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.39458019E9,"simScore":0.767846786570752,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":137,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"bonams","label":"just my 2cents as an aircraft maintenance engineer\n\n**probable theory for MH370: right wing structural failure?**\n\n[aircraft course changed from 25° track to 40° track](http://i.imgur.com/3fj3qZ8.png) during its last moments on radar and its speed reduced from 474knots to 471knots.

If the plane disintegrated mid air at 35000ft, it would have caused an explosive decompression and threw large amount of cabin items scattering onto the sea where it\u0027s location was last reported. However there\u0027s been 5 days of search if there\u0027s any debris (magazines, safety cards, pillows) then it\u0027s quite likely the search team would have encountered some, but it\u0027s yet to be found. \n\n\n(2) The plane probably glided afar from the location of incident. Following the point above, given that the plane did not disintegrate mid-air, a sudden loss of total communication would indicate something catastrophic happened, or deliberate. Since modern plane runs on multiple systems, losing one system such as hydraulics would not easily compromise other systems such as transponder or ADS-B, which is used by flightradar24 to gather the location details. This would suggest the failure was induced deliberately, such as by tripping a circuit breaking or simply switching off the transponder. \n\n\n(3) This is likely an intentional act. Due to the lack of debris to be found in the area of incident, the plane is likely to have been intact since it disappeared off radar. Pilots should have access to flight charts showing airspaces and radar information. It would be possible for pilots to deliberately avoid radar detection (either by flying out of range into the sea or flying low, which would not be feasible for commercial jets). It was over the sea when this happened, and it is between airspace handovers, although I could not find any information about airspace boundaries in Malaysia and Vietnam, but it could easily be a blind spot for ATCs. \n\n\n(4) There\u0027s not likely any survivors. There\u0027s been suggested the plane could have landed somewhere, but with 200+ passengers onboard if they all landed it would be an operational nightmare to keep them hostage, a logistics horror to keep them fed, and impossible to keep them quiet, especially when everyone is carrying a phone. It could be argued not everyone on earth has GSM coverage, but if they can find an airport that\u0027s going to land a fully loaded 777, it\u0027s probably not in a village with nobody in. It also does not make sense for anyone to keep 200+ people hostage without coming out with demands. \n\n\n\nGathering the observations I\u0027ve made so far, my conspiracy would be this being a deliberate act with only people onboard involved. A person on the flight could likely be involved with switching off communication with the outside world, steering the plane out of ATC radar\u0027d airspace, reaching the ocean and very likely plunging the plane 90º vertically into the sea. \n\n\nIf this was done over the sea it would create a small debris zone, and extremely likely the debris would have sank into the sea immediately. The passengers might not even be aware of this happened while the flight was deliberately flown off course until the rapid descent at the end, which would take less than a minute from cruising altitude to reach the surface of the sea, if anyone were to try and get help with a phone, this would be almost impossible even with phone reception.
