as president of world footballs governing body fifa as reports emerge he is under investigation in the united states the swiss was reelected last week despite seven top fifa officials being arrested in a massive corruption probe announcing his shock exit the yearold blatter who has been in power for  years said my mandate does not appear to be supported by everybody he plans to carry on his duties until a replacement can be elected fifa has been dogged by corruption allegations for years now but it was rocked to its core last week by the arrests of seven fifa officials on charges of racketeering wire fraud and money laundering the charges are part of a us prosecution that indicted a total of  people from around the globe further allegations emerged on tuesday that increased the pressure reports also claimed fifa general secretary jerome valcke was responsible for an alleged payment of a m m bribe in relation to south africas bid to host the  world cup the yearold frenchman denies any wrongdoing a separate criminal investigation by swiss authorities into how the  and  world cups were allocated is also under way bbc radio  live sports news correspondent richard conway said blatter will not have wanted to leave this way he wanted to bring fifa and football back together but that ignored the huge weight of the allegations that stood against the organisation said conway in the end blatters position became untenable and we will perhaps know more in the weeks ahead about what exactly tipped him over the edge the bbcs kieran fox was in zurich when the drama unfolded he explains what happened after media were invited to an unscheduled news conference please turn on javascript media requires javascript to play andrew harding on mr blatters enduring appeal across africa the invitation came at pm local a scramble to fifa hq in the leafy hills of zurich and still no more details the news conference was due to start at pm pm then pm the large conference room was barely a third full at pm a shrugging forlorn director of communications walked in mr blatter would be making a statement he said blatter looked reluctant perhaps a little sad that  years of his lifes work was coming to an end the press room was silent noone really expected this just four days after winning a fifth term as fifa president his speech lasted barely four minutes speech over he left to silence blatter says he wants to bring forward the date of the next fifa congress so members can elect his successor as soon as possible it is due to take place on  may  in mexico city but blatter says waiting until then will create unnecessary delay he added i will urge the executive committee to organise an extraordinary congress for the election of my successor at the earliest opportunity this will need to be done in line with fifas statutes and we must allow enough time for the best candidates to present themselves and to campaign the extraordinary congress is expected to take place between december  and march  prince ali bin alhussein was beaten by blatter in last weeks election as the swiss earned a fifth term in office the jordanian has indicated he is willing to step into the role insisting he is always there to serve football he added i think thats the most important thing and to do so much work to fix this organisation in a proper way michel platini president of european footballs governing body uefa is also being tipped as a likely contender the yearold frenchman did not want to stand against blatter but this could be his opportunity to make his move former france international david ginola has also confirmed he intends to stand but his chances of success are slim blatter says he stood for reelection as he felt it was the best option for football when he quit he said he did so in fifas best interests however he indicated his influence will not end just yet and said his focus now was driving farreaching fundamental reforms that transcend our previous efforts he added for years we have worked hard to put in place administrative reforms but it is plain to me that while these must continue they are not enough we need deeprooted structural change perhaps of more immediate concern for blatter is the scope of the twin corruption probe particularly the us investigation us officials quoted in the new york times said they hoped to gain the cooperation of some fifa figures now under indictment to try to build a case against the fifa president his troubles may only just be beginning added conway platini had urged blatter to quit following the arrests in switzerland after blatters decision to step down platini said it was a difficult decision a brave decision and the right decision please turn on javascript media requires javascript to play sepp blatters controversial career the football association has been vociferous in its criticism of blatter news of his exit was welcomed by fa chairman greg dyke this is great news for football he told the bbc it should have happened years ago he added there has to be a rootandbranch investigation of fifa it has all got to be transparent in the future former portugal international luis figo who withdrew from the presidential election eight days before the vote said blatters exit represented a good day for fifa and for football he added change is finally coming now we should responsibly and calmly find a consensual solution worldwide in order to start a new era of dynamism transparency and democracy in fifa reaction twitter responds to resignation how fifa makes and spends its money mountain goats to tight shorts blatter in quotes world cup sponsor cocacola issued a statement calling blatters resignation a positive step it added we believe this decision will help fifa transform itself rapidly into a muchneeded st century structure and institution blatters daughter corinne told the bbc that she was both sad and relieved adding that the pressure had been wearing him down she added my wish now is for calm to be restored both for my father and for world football but above all i wish for the world to finally acknowledge the great things he has done for football in the last  years my father is my father he is a wonderful person by making this decision he also wants to protect us his family first and foremost his decision has nothing absolutely nothing at all to do with the accusations that are currently circulating my father is an honest person who has dedicated his life to football england lost out to russia in the bidding for the  world cup simon johnson who led englands bid told bbc radio  live i want the full facts around the bidding to be known and published i want there to be openness and transparency if everybody won it because of a fair fight and everything was fair and objective and transparent then good if it was found there was improper behaviour in any way by any of the winning bidders then fifa must have a look at whether they should reopen the process johnson said he still thinks the  tournament will go ahead the preliminary draw for the russia world cup is a few weeks away and its too late to change that he said however he felt qataris may be worried about losing the  competition a sentiment echoed by dyke if i was in qatar now i would not be very confident said dyke those comments drew a sharp response from sheikh hamad bin khalifa al thani president of the qatar football association we would urge mr dyke to let the legal process take its course and concentrate on delivering his promise to build an england team capable of winning the  fifa world cup in qatar he said blatter walks away after his resignation speech in zurich this entry is now closed for comments russia are going for  and  and the bookies are paying out can we now look at the premier league a domestic league dominated by clubs prostituted to the highest international bidder then sold to the world for astronomical profit wages and transfer fees  out of control  english talent stymied by its very existence and grass roots football in financial crisis disconnected from the professional game fifa the fa the pl uefa i see no difference  alexander why dont we take the investigations all the way back as to when the us was awarded the fifa football world cup as i recall the us created a professional league in  and somehow were awarded to host the world cup in mmmm lets start with those hard questions shall we this comment was removed because it broke the house rules explain did rupert murdoch want him in or out he is maybe rethinking his trip to canada aswell for the ladies world cup finals on a previous have your say i made a comment about certain surprising aspects of the conduct of one of the matches at the last world cup the post was deemed inadmissable because it was defamatory i assume i now would like to ask does the bbc really think that fifa corruption was limited to off the pitch activities i dont expect an answer we will see im no football fan but this is welcome news i knew blatters reelection was going to be short lived but at least hes thrown the towel in before he was pushed maybe football can shake this negative era into a more positive future boring come on bbc lets have some real news on the front page  not this boring little story about some game i do not want corruption and exploitation on a massive scale going unpunished but i feel irritated when we are given propaganda dressed up as news treat readers viewers and listeners as intelligent people capable of forming their own opinions this saga is more about an international power struggle than about ensuring football is governed honestly resignation  good fair election  maybe were having some problems displaying the
