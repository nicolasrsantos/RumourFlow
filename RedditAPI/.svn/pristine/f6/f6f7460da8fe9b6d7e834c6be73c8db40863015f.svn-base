I was young when Perot twisted the election and supported him, but now all these years later I understand why Perot was just a joke.  \n\nI\u0027ve had some argue that Sanders would be another Perot, in my circle of 40 to 60 year old colleagues and friends.  But Sanders is on a completely different spectrum as he\u0027s been sharing the same views for decades.  Sanders also has a sincerity and an aspect of moral responsibility that carries in his passion.  Versus some billionaire with charts from Texas who just wanted to play in politics.\n\nThe difference with this election is important on so many levels.  It seems between the two parties the gap in the social divide is huge.\n\nI\u0027m very proud of today\u0027s youth.  I have three children, 2 adults and one will be an adult next year.  I\u0027ve seen how from my generation to their generation how open minded, compassionate they are as to social issues, that when I was growing up was the minority. \n\nAlso Sanders appeals to older generations - in watching some of his town hall speeches, there\u0027s always a good share of silver hair! Nonetheless Bernie is an aged hippie - so he probably has a base from the hippie era who know and remember him as one who supported Civil Rights and walked with MLK.  \n\nI also think the aged Baby Boomer hippie crowd has also been a major reason that the legalization of pot has been at a high. (ha- pun!) because those just a generation older, who were definitely conservative have passed on. \n\nSo I do feel it\u0027s fair to say that Sanders appeals to three generations of people simply because he \u0027gets it\u0027.  I\u0027m not sure what other candidate can have that much of an appeal overall to three generations.

The folks that lost their collective minds when Anheuser Busch was bought by \"a bunch of foreigners\" will never support concepts which require a high school diploma to understand.  However, they\u0027re quite literally a dying breed and Millennials are about to replace Boomers when it comes to driving the national political conversation.  Not every voter in Alabama is Harvey Updyke (note: War Eagle).  That\u0027s where Bernie fits.\n\nThat said, all hope is not lost for older voters.  I spent an hour discussing Bernie with my mother (a big fan of Glenn Beck) and tuned his messaging to the dog whistle politics of the right.  Beck spent so much time shouting \"follow the money\" that a rundown of SuperPACs and lists of corporate donors was enough to convince her that Bernie\u0027s the best candidate.

I don\u0027t know if you\u0027re a gun person, but we almost entirely use the same firearms and ammo as the police, and their body armor wouldn\u0027t stop a large percentage of what we (and they) use. Police departments wouldn\u0027t last 24 hours if everyone in America with a gun decided to \"overthrow\" their local police departments. I don\u0027t think the general populace would ever go for that without some extreme \"all brown-eyed people report to the train station\" situation, but we certainly have the muscle to pull it off if we collectively decide we want to do so. \n\nThe military would admittedly be a different story, but I don\u0027t think they could logistically pull off mass-bombing places like Kentucky, Colorado, Texas, Idaho, and California a la Tokyo or Vietnam. The guys dropping the bombs, driving the tanks, loading the mortars, and pulling the triggers are just normal Americans who would agree with me and you on most things and wouldn\u0027t just erase Wyoming from the map because some General they\u0027ve never met deemed them \"terrorists\" just like you or I wouldn\u0027t.

If Hilary is ever elected it would be two. \n\n\u0026gt;it\u0027s your ability to comprehend it.\n\nMy comprehension ability is quite well, and unless you have some hidden meaning only known to you, I stand by what I said. \n\n\u0026gt;The previous two sentences would not have been needed if you would try to hold a conversation without insults.\n\nAgain, you are not making much sense. I don\u0027t even know how to parse something like that. The previous two sentences stand... regardless of anything I could respond with, or even attempt a conversation with. The last one negates the first two. Unless you get into the area of doublethink of course, as it appears you have no discomfort with holding two contradictory beliefs which would be the basis for cognitive dissonance. \n\n\u0026gt;It does make sense. Out of the last 28 years, 24 have been either a Clinton or a bush\n\nOk, let\u0027s do the math. The first bush was in office in 89, but let\u0027s go with the elected in 88\u0027 and let\u0027s consider the next one being 2016 so.. 28 years, you were right on that point. Now where you falter is... the first bush 88-92 \u003d 4 years. Clinton 92-00 \u003d 8 years, bush jr, 00-08 \u003d 8 years. 4 + 8 + 8 \u003d 20.. not 24. \n\n\u0026gt;why elect another Clinton\n\nThere has been 1 Clinton. It\u0027s not like they have some type of dynasty or some shit, there has been 2 bushes, yes. I can see your argument against that. But the argument of \"why elect another Clinton\", is weak as hell. If you don\u0027t like Hilary for easily found reasons then so be it, say that, and hell there would be nothing wrong with that, but making it sound like there has been more than one Clinton is just nonsensical. Or does Bill count as two people? The Clinton vs bush years \u003d 8 / 12. So if Hilary is the nominee, and she is a 1 term president it would be 12/12, 2 terms 16/12. After that point if it were to happen, I could see you saying ok why another Clinton, because by then it would have been two, and not one, that was prior. \n\n\u0026gt;when there are Literally Hundreds of Millions of other people in the US that can be president.\n\nNo, not really. You have to be 35 to be president, and within the US as a resident for the last 14 years. Now while it\u0027s possible for someone who is 35 to be president, it\u0027s incredibly unlikely. The youngest so far being Roosevelt at 42. Clinton was 46, and Obama was 47. If we take the last 10 and get an average, we get around 46.7. But hey, let\u0027s start out with 35..., Oh and the oldest being 69, almost 70.\n\nI can\u0027t find hard numbers but, doing a little math to get an estimate shouldn\u0027t hurt. According to the 2010 census. There are/were roughly \n\n20.1m - 35 to 39, \n\n20.9m - 40 to 44,\n\n22.7m - 45 to 49\n\n22.3m - 50 to 54\n\n19.6m - 55 to 59\n\n16.8m - 60 to 64\n\n12.5m - 65 to 69\n\n9.3m - 70 to 74\n\n7.3m - 75 to 79\n\n5.8m - 80 to 84\n\n3.6m - 85 to 89\n\n1.5m - 90 to 94\n\n372k - 95 to 99\n\n54k - 100+\n\nSo let\u0027s just say 163m or so. So... \"literally\", there are not \"hundreds of millions\", as would be the case if there were say 200m or more people eligible. I won\u0027t even get into the whole illegal deal, where the number would likely shrink down. Not below 100m though. Now realistically. we can take 40-69, and get a decent idea how many people would be eligible. That would be say 115m people. If you take away illegals then, it would get closer to the 100m mark. Again though \"literally\" 100\u0027s of millions of people, meaning plural, would be multiples of 100\u0027s. Since there are only around 320 million, half of the population wouldn\u0027t be considered \"hundreds\". Again, it makes it seem like you don\u0027t know what you are talking about. That wasn\u0027t an insult, it\u0027s just an observation. If you want to be taken seriously, maybe speak in a way you could? \n\n\n\u0026gt;I see your point that we\u0027ve only elected one Clinton, but why elect another?\n\nOk, that goes back to my point, where your third sentence, just completely fucks the first two... \"Time to let some other families have a go.\" If you take family at 2 or more people, it\u0027s only been one family so far. Not two. \n\n\u0026gt;The only reason she\u0027s an option is because her husband was a really good President when his pants were on.\n\nEven if Bill wasn\u0027t president, I am sure she would have been in the scene by now. She is a decent politician. Now as for the bit about \"when his pants were on\". That makes no sense still. He was president when his pants were on and off. He, I believe made deals with his dick in Lewinsky\u0027s mouth, so saying that bit, even considering the fact when he was doing that, he was still a \"good\" president. He may not have fit your, or other\u0027s morals, but he still did a decent job. Not great by any stretch, but great by comparison with the person that came after. \n\n\u0026gt;The fact the same families keep going for the white house shows that there is something wrong in the system right now of how we go about electing our top dog.\n\nYet you said \"other families have a go\". Why would you say that, if you felt that way? You seem to rail against dynasties, but then come back with saying ok, I am, or might be for it, so long as it\u0027s not a one or two tiered dynasty, but 3, sure... Do you see how that makes little to no sense? \n\nThe reason it is that way, is that politics is an insiders game. It takes a bit to get into it, and know your way around. So if you have a family member or someone close, with that inside track, you have a natural advantage. It\u0027s the same for just about any kind of job, it\u0027s just illuminated a bit more in politics. If your father/mother is a doctor, then it would be easier for you to be a doctor, as you have someone who paved the path for you, and could help you out to get there. Maybe make the path a little less bumpy? It\u0027s not something that is necessarily wrong with how we choose the president, or the system. It\u0027s a matter of how shit is, and will likely always be in the US. \n\nOh and back to the 100 mil or so people could be the president. Sure, that\u0027s theoretically possible, but so is engineering pigs to fly. Even outside of the realm of realistically possible, you would have to go with just about every politician at a state level and above, and count them, then for shits and giggles add another million to it, and you still will not be anywhere near close to what you said. Realistically though if given the proper attention, maybe, just maybe a few hundred could ever be elected. Sanders, would barely make that list. I like him, and would vote for him, but hey? We will see. He\u0027s on the out skirts of reality right now though. \n\nAlmost forgot.. \n\n\u0026gt;Try not insulting people when responding\n\nI will assume it\u0027s due to the following line\n\n\u0026gt;Also the last line, just makes it seem like you don\u0027t even know what you are talking about.\n\nMaybe your comprehension is off. I added a qualifier. \"makes it seem\". It wasn\u0027t an outright insult. It was pointing out the doublethink, of you holding two contradictory beliefs. If you say something like believing in free will, and fate at the same time. Or in religious sectors, \"gods plan\", and \"free will\". Both being mutually exclusive, where as one negates the other wholly, it\u0027s \"doublethink\". If you happen to have some conflict about holding both, like questioning it, or one or the other, then it would be cognitive dissonance. People who do that (doublethink), can be seen as... \"not knowing what they are talking about\".

Out of the last 28 years, 24 have been either a Clinton or a bush\n\nOk, let\u0027s do the math. The first bush was in office in 89, but let\u0027s go with the elected in 88\u0027 and let\u0027s consider the next one being 2016 so.. 28 years, you were right on that point. Now where you falter is... the first bush 88-92 \u003d 4 years. Clinton 92-00 \u003d 8 years, bush jr, 00-08 \u003d 8 years. 4 + 8 + 8 \u003d 20.. not 24. \n\n\u0026gt;why elect another Clinton\n\nThere has been 1 Clinton. It\u0027s not like they have some type of dynasty or some shit, there has been 2 bushes, yes. I can see your argument against that. But the argument of \"why elect another Clinton\", is weak as hell. If you don\u0027t like Hilary for easily found reasons then so be it, say that, and hell there would be nothing wrong with that, but making it sound like there has been more than one Clinton is just nonsensical. Or does Bill count as two people? The Clinton vs bush years \u003d 8 / 12. So if Hilary is the nominee, and she is a 1 term president it would be 12/12, 2 terms 16/12. After that point if it were to happen, I could see you saying ok why another Clinton, because by then it would have been two, and not one, that was prior. \n\n\u0026gt;when there are Literally Hundreds of Millions of other people in the US that can be president.\n\nNo, not really. You have to be 35 to be president, and within the US as a resident for the last 14 years. Now while it\u0027s possible for someone who is 35 to be president, it\u0027s incredibly unlikely. The youngest so far being Roosevelt at 42. Clinton was 46, and Obama was 47. If we take the last 10 and get an average, we get around 46.7. But hey, let\u0027s start out with 35..., Oh and the oldest being 69, almost 70.\n\nI can\u0027t find hard numbers but, doing a little math to get an estimate shouldn\u0027t hurt. According to the 2010 census. There are/were roughly \n\n20.1m - 35 to 39, \n\n20.9m - 40 to 44,\n\n22.7m - 45 to 49\n\n22.3m - 50 to 54\n\n19.6m - 55 to 59\n\n16.8m - 60 to 64\n\n12.5m - 65 to 69\n\n9.3m - 70 to 74\n\n7.3m - 75 to 79\n\n5.8m - 80 to 84\n\n3.6m - 85 to 89\n\n1.5m - 90 to 94\n\n372k - 95 to 99\n\n54k - 100+\n\nSo let\u0027s just say 163m or so. So... \"literally\", there are not \"hundreds of millions\", as would be the case if there were say 200m or more people eligible. I won\u0027t even get into the whole illegal deal, where the number would likely shrink down. Not below 100m though. Now realistically. we can take 40-69, and get a decent idea how many people would be eligible. That would be say 115m people. If you take away illegals then, it would get closer to the 100m mark. Again though \"literally\" 100\u0027s of millions of people, meaning plural, would be multiples of 100\u0027s. Since there are only around 320 million, half of the population wouldn\u0027t be considered \"hundreds\". Again, it makes it seem like you don\u0027t know what you are talking about. That wasn\u0027t an insult, it\u0027s just an observation. If you want to be taken seriously, maybe speak in a way you could? \n\n\n\u0026gt;I see your point that we\u0027ve only elected one Clinton, but why elect another?\n\nOk, that goes back to my point, where your third sentence, just completely fucks the first two... \"Time to let some other families have a go.\" If you take family at 2 or more people, it\u0027s only been one family so far. Not two. \n\n\u0026gt;The only reason she\u0027s an option is because her husband was a really good President when his pants were on.\n\nEven if Bill wasn\u0027t president, I am sure she would have been in the scene by now. She is a decent politician. Now as for the bit about \"when his pants were on\". That makes no sense still. He was president when his pants were on and off. He, I believe made deals with his dick in Lewinsky\u0027s mouth, so saying that bit, even considering the fact when he was doing that, he was still a \"good\" president. He may not have fit your, or other\u0027s morals, but he still did a decent job. Not great by any stretch, but great by comparison with the person that came after. \n\n\u0026gt;The fact the same families keep going for the white house shows that there is something wrong in the system right now of how we go about electing our top dog.\n\nYet you said \"other families have a go\". Why would you say that, if you felt that way? You seem to rail against dynasties, but then come back with saying ok, I am, or might be for it, so long as it\u0027s not a one or two tiered dynasty, but 3, sure... Do you see how that makes little to no sense? \n\nThe reason it is that way, is that politics is an insiders game. It takes a bit to get into it, and know your way around. So if you have a family member or someone close, with that inside track, you have a natural advantage. It\u0027s the same for just about any kind of job, it\u0027s just illuminated a bit more in politics. If your father/mother is a doctor, then it would be easier for you to be a doctor, as you have someone who paved the path for you, and could help you out to get there. Maybe make the path a little less bumpy? It\u0027s not something that is necessarily wrong with how we choose the president, or the system. It\u0027s a matter of how shit is, and will likely always be in the US. \n\nOh and back to the 100 mil or so people could be the president. Sure, that\u0027s theoretically possible, but so is engineering pigs to fly. Even outside of the realm of realistically possible, you would have to go with just about every politician at a state level and above, and count them, then for shits and giggles add another million to it, and you still will not be anywhere near close to what you said. Realistically though if given the proper attention, maybe, just maybe a few hundred could ever be elected. Sanders, would barely make that list. I like him, and would vote for him, but hey? We will see. He\u0027s on the out skirts of reality right now though. \n\nAlmost forgot.. \n\n\u0026gt;Try not insulting people when responding\n\nI will assume it\u0027s due to the following line\n\n\u0026gt;Also the last line, just makes it seem like you don\u0027t even know what you are talking about.\n\nMaybe your comprehension is off. I added a qualifier. \"makes it seem\". It wasn\u0027t an outright insult. It was pointing out the doublethink, of you holding two contradictory beliefs. If you say something like believing in free will, and fate at the same time. Or in religious sectors, \"gods plan\", and \"free will\". Both being mutually exclusive, where as one negates the other wholly, it\u0027s \"doublethink\". If you happen to have some conflict about holding both, like questioning it, or one or the other, then it would be cognitive dissonance.

To stay within your logical frame of mind, it would have to be a single person with the family name. So that would drastically cut it down, easily by half, if not by 3, 4 or more. Remember, your original statement \"This is not a Monarchy.\", and the addition of Clinton, means that anyone other than say one person per family you would consider it to be leaning toward, or being a \"monarchy\". Also as I pointed out, even though someone may technically be eligible, it doesn\u0027t mean that they would be electable, and or ever in a position to do something like that. Realistically right now in this climate, you have maybe 10 people who could be. With a lot of resources, time, and effort, the next election cycle, you could take your choice now, of say maybe 1,000 or so. But to get them elected would take a shit ton of work. They would almost certainly have to have held office at the higher state level, and or federal level. Say a senator, or congress. I don\u0027t even think a state senator could be right now. Not without a ton of work, but say a governor? Maybe? \n\n\n\u0026gt;which can lead to still having influence even though you no longer hold the office.\n\nIf your whole premise is based on that, then you have no real case. There will always be some type of influence, that\u0027s never going to stop. Even if you took money out of politics, you would still have it. From father to son to brother, to husband to wife, so to friend to friend, or just someone you like, and or agree with. Politics is the art of negotiation, not as much any more, but yeah. You have to give a little to get a little, in an ideal situation. And whenever someone knows someone, there will always be room for influence, be it paid, bribed, or whatnot. It will just be less so. Just because one person of one family is there, then another, doesn\u0027t mean that the husband, brother/father will have any say over them. They may help out with some advice? Or something along those lines, maybe get the presidents ear a little more than most. I mean look at the bush example. Sr, I respected a bit, didn\u0027t like him, but I like him a lot more than jr. Do you think that Sr, told jr, to go into Iraq? Or advise him on anything? Or found some way to provide preferential treatment he wouldn\u0027t have otherwise have gotten? I think maybe if jr, listed to dear old pop, he may have not been the worse president, or at least a leading candidate. Maybe listen more to him than say cheany? \n\nMy overall point is that, a family doesn\u0027t matter in the grand scheme of things. What matters is \"can the person do the job\", \"can they do it well\", \"will they fuck us all to hell\"?, etc, etc. And on that metric, it should be clear. But what your logic is saying.... Is say one person is from a family who had a husband/brother as president, and let\u0027s say they are perfect for the job, and let\u0027s fast forward into a potential future, where that person being president, would benefit you, and the country greatly. Yet, by your logic, if Joe Smith, was running against them, you would be for that, since they do not represent a \"monarchy\", and even if you believed they would be terrible, you still think it would somehow be worse in your monarchy scenario. Again, it\u0027s the person that matters, not the family. If you want to diss bush, and or Clinton, and not want them to be president? Sure fine do that, There are very good arguments for both. But in reality, a dynasty is not one of them, it\u0027s noise and nothing more. It adds nothing significant to the argument when you look at it logically. I personally don\u0027t like the idea of multiple people from the same family in the whitehouse, even 5th cousins, but that\u0027s my bias, and I understand that. I just try not to let it shade logical thinking. \n\n\u0026gt;Also, I do not see your case for \"doublethink\".\n\nTo make it as simple as possible, you basically said, I don\u0027t like families in the whitehouse, but it\u0027s time to let other families have a chance in the whitehouse. Meaning you are not for another bush or Clinton, but, let\u0027s say another family, let\u0027s say Joe, and Billy Smith would be fine. The problem I think you run into is that you tried to square your initial logic, by giving yourself an out, but you cut yourself off at the knees logically speaking. Now if you wouldn\u0027t have said \"families\", and said something like another person. Then your logic would have been sound (yet not sound as good), sans doublethink. With \"families\", it introduces doublethink, as both are mutually exclusive. You can\u0027t be against families in the whitehouse, and then give a statement directly after it, saying you would be ok with families, just not those families, it severely undercuts your argument. \n\nTo try to make it as simple as I can... taking away all of the noise.. you basically said, I don\u0027t like A, and it needs to stop, but I think A should have a go... If that doesn\u0027t help you understand, I don\u0027t know what will.

To stay within your logical frame of mind, it would have to be a single person with the family name. So that would drastically cut it down, easily by half, if not by 3, 4 or more. Remember, your original statement \"This is not a Monarchy.\", and the addition of Clinton, means that anyone other than say one person per family you would consider it to be leaning toward, or being a \"monarchy\". Also as I pointed out, even though someone may technically be eligible, it doesn\u0027t mean that they would be electable, and or ever in a position to do something like that. Realistically right now in this climate, you have maybe 10 people who could be. With a lot of resources, time, and effort, the next election cycle, you could take your choice now, of say maybe 1,000 or so. But to get them elected would take a shit ton of work. They would almost certainly have to have held office at the higher state level, and or federal level. Say a senator, or congress. I don\u0027t even think a state senator could be right now. Not without a ton of work, but say a governor? Maybe? \n\n\n\u0026gt;which can lead to still having influence even though you no longer hold the office.\n\nIf your whole premise is based on that, then you have no real case. There will always be some type of influence, that\u0027s never going to stop. Even if you took money out of politics, you would still have it. From father to son to brother, to husband to wife, so to friend to friend, or just someone you like, and or agree with. Politics is the art of negotiation, not as much any more, but yeah. You have to give a little to get a little, in an ideal situation. And whenever someone knows someone, there will always be room for influence, be it paid, bribed, or whatnot. It will just be less so. Just because one person of one family is there, then another, doesn\u0027t mean that the husband, brother/father will have any say over them. They may help out with some advice? Or something along those lines, maybe get the presidents ear a little more than most. I mean look at the bush example. Sr, I respected a bit, didn\u0027t like him, but I like him a lot more than jr. Do you think that Sr, told jr, to go into Iraq? Or advise him on anything? Or found some way to provide preferential treatment he wouldn\u0027t have otherwise have gotten? I think maybe if jr, listed to dear old pop, he may have not been the worse president, or at least a leading candidate. Maybe listen more to him than say cheany? \n\nMy overall point is that, a family doesn\u0027t matter in the grand scheme of things. What matters is \"can the person do the job\", \"can they do it well\", \"will they fuck us all to hell\"?, etc, etc. And on that metric, it should be clear. But what your logic is saying.... Is say one person is from a family who had a husband/brother as president, and let\u0027s say they are perfect for the job, and let\u0027s fast forward into a potential future, where that person being president, would benefit you, and the country greatly. Yet, by your logic, if Joe Smith, was running against them, you would be for that, since they do not represent a \"monarchy\", and even if you believed they would be terrible, you still think it would somehow be worse in your monarchy scenario. Again, it\u0027s the person that matters, not the family. If you want to diss bush, and or Clinton, and not want them to be president? Sure fine do that, There are very good arguments for both. But in reality, a dynasty is not one of them, it\u0027s noise and nothing more. It adds nothing significant to the argument when you look at it logically. I personally don\u0027t like the idea of multiple people from the same family in the whitehouse, even 5th cousins, but that\u0027s my bias, and I understand that. I just try not to let it shade logical thinking. \n\n\u0026gt;Also, I do not see your case for \"doublethink\".\n\nTo make it as simple as possible, you basically said, I don\u0027t like families in the whitehouse, but it\u0027s time to let other families have a chance in the whitehouse. Meaning you are not for another bush or Clinton, but, let\u0027s say another family, let\u0027s say Joe, and Billy Smith would be fine. The problem I think you run into is that you tried to square your initial logic, by giving yourself an out, but you cut yourself off at the knees logically speaking. Now if you wouldn\u0027t have said \"families\", and said something like another person. Then your logic would have been sound (yet not sound as good), sans doublethink. With \"families\", it introduces doublethink, as both are mutually exclusive. You can\u0027t be against families in the whitehouse, and then give a statement directly after it, saying you would be ok with families, just not those families, it severely undercuts your argument. \n\nTo try to make it as simple as I can... taking away all of the noise.. you basically said, I don\u0027t like A, and it needs to stop, but I think A should have a go... If that doesn\u0027t help you understand, I don\u0027t know what will.

I don\u0027t even know how to parse something like that. The previous two sentences stand... regardless of anything I could respond with, or even attempt a conversation with. The last one negates the first two. Unless you get into the area of doublethink of course, as it appears you have no discomfort with holding two contradictory beliefs which would be the basis for cognitive dissonance. \n\n\u0026gt;It does make sense. Out of the last 28 years, 24 have been either a Clinton or a bush\n\nOk, let\u0027s do the math. The first bush was in office in 89, but let\u0027s go with the elected in 88\u0027 and let\u0027s consider the next one being 2016 so.. 28 years, you were right on that point. Now where you falter is... the first bush 88-92 \u003d 4 years. Clinton 92-00 \u003d 8 years, bush jr, 00-08 \u003d 8 years. 4 + 8 + 8 \u003d 20.. not 24. \n\n\u0026gt;why elect another Clinton\n\nThere has been 1 Clinton. It\u0027s not like they have some type of dynasty or some shit, there has been 2 bushes, yes. I can see your argument against that. But the argument of \"why elect another Clinton\", is weak as hell. If you don\u0027t like Hilary for easily found reasons then so be it, say that, and hell there would be nothing wrong with that, but making it sound like there has been more than one Clinton is just nonsensical. Or does Bill count as two people? The Clinton vs bush years \u003d 8 / 12. So if Hilary is the nominee, and she is a 1 term president it would be 12/12, 2 terms 16/12. After that point if it were to happen, I could see you saying ok why another Clinton, because by then it would have been two, and not one, that was prior. \n\n\u0026gt;when there are Literally Hundreds of Millions of other people in the US that can be president.\n\nNo, not really. You have to be 35 to be president, and within the US as a resident for the last 14 years. Now while it\u0027s possible for someone who is 35 to be president, it\u0027s incredibly unlikely. The youngest so far being Roosevelt at 42. Clinton was 46, and Obama was 47. If we take the last 10 and get an average, we get around 46.7. But hey, let\u0027s start out with 35..., Oh and the oldest being 69, almost 70.\n\nI can\u0027t find hard numbers but, doing a little math to get an estimate shouldn\u0027t hurt. According to the 2010 census. There are/were roughly \n\n20.1m - 35 to 39, \n\n20.9m - 40 to 44,\n\n22.7m - 45 to 49\n\n22.3m - 50 to 54\n\n19.6m - 55 to 59\n\n16.8m - 60 to 64\n\n12.5m - 65 to 69\n\n9.3m - 70 to 74\n\n7.3m - 75 to 79\n\n5.8m - 80 to 84\n\n3.6m - 85 to 89\n\n1.5m - 90 to 94\n\n372k - 95 to 99\n\n54k - 100+\n\nSo let\u0027s just say 163m or so. So... \"literally\", there are not \"hundreds of millions\", as would be the case if there were say 200m or more people eligible. I won\u0027t even get into the whole illegal deal, where the number would likely shrink down. Not below 100m though. Now realistically. we can take 40-69, and get a decent idea how many people would be eligible. That would be say 115m people. If you take away illegals then, it would get closer to the 100m mark. Again though \"literally\" 100\u0027s of millions of people, meaning plural, would be multiples of 100\u0027s. Since there are only around 320 million, half of the population wouldn\u0027t be considered \"hundreds\". Again, it makes it seem like you don\u0027t know what you are talking about. That wasn\u0027t an insult, it\u0027s just an observation. If you want to be taken seriously, maybe speak in a way you could? \n\n\n\u0026gt;I see your point that we\u0027ve only elected one Clinton, but why elect another?\n\nOk, that goes back to my point, where your third sentence, just completely fucks the first two... \"Time to let some other families have a go.\" If you take family at 2 or more people, it\u0027s only been one family so far. Not two. \n\n\u0026gt;The only reason she\u0027s an option is because her husband was a really good President when his pants were on.\n\nEven if Bill wasn\u0027t president, I am sure she would have been in the scene by now. She is a decent politician. Now as for the bit about \"when his pants were on\". That makes no sense still. He was president when his pants were on and off. He, I believe made deals with his dick in Lewinsky\u0027s mouth, so saying that bit, even considering the fact when he was doing that, he was still a \"good\" president. He may not have fit your, or other\u0027s morals, but he still did a decent job. Not great by any stretch, but great by comparison with the person that came after. \n\n\u0026gt;The fact the same families keep going for the white house shows that there is something wrong in the system right now of how we go about electing our top dog.\n\nYet you said \"other families have a go\". Why would you say that, if you felt that way? You seem to rail against dynasties, but then come back with saying ok, I am, or might be for it, so long as it\u0027s not a one or two tiered dynasty, but 3, sure... Do you see how that makes little to no sense? \n\nThe reason it is that way, is that politics is an insiders game. It takes a bit to get into it, and know your way around. So if you have a family member or someone close, with that inside track, you have a natural advantage. It\u0027s the same for just about any kind of job, it\u0027s just illuminated a bit more in politics. If your father/mother is a doctor, then it would be easier for you to be a doctor, as you have someone who paved the path for you, and could help you out to get there. Maybe make the path a little less bumpy? It\u0027s not something that is necessarily wrong with how we choose the president, or the system. It\u0027s a matter of how shit is, and will likely always be in the US. \n\nOh and back to the 100 mil or so people could be the president. Sure, that\u0027s theoretically possible, but so is engineering pigs to fly. Even outside of the realm of realistically possible, you would have to go with just about every politician at a state level and above, and count them, then for shits and giggles add another million to it, and you still will not be anywhere near close to what you said. Realistically though if given the proper attention, maybe, just maybe a few hundred could ever be elected. Sanders, would barely make that list. I like him, and would vote for him, but hey? We will see. He\u0027s on the out skirts of reality right now though. \n\nAlmost forgot.. \n\n\u0026gt;Try not insulting people when responding\n\nI will assume it\u0027s due to the following line\n\n\u0026gt;Also the last line, just makes it seem like you don\u0027t even know what you are talking about.\n\nMaybe your comprehension is off. I added a qualifier. \"makes it seem\". It wasn\u0027t an outright insult. It was pointing out the doublethink, of you holding two contradictory beliefs. If you say something like believing in free will, and fate at the same time. Or in religious sectors, \"gods plan\", and \"free will\". Both being mutually exclusive, where as one negates the other wholly, it\u0027s \"doublethink\". If you happen to have some conflict about holding both, like questioning it, or one or the other, then it would be cognitive dissonance. People who do that (doublethink), can be seen as... \"not knowing what they are talking about\".

Maybe some I forgot, but hey.. Willard will never win. christie, is a long shot, but possible depending, brother bush, maybe depending on how much help he gets, and whether he can keep his foot out of his mouth, rubio is the token hispanic, with no chance of winning, paul while he has some good ideas, most are bat shit insane, so no way could he win popular majority support nation wide. carson gives bush jr a run for his money on the idiot/dumbass scale. With jindal, he\u0027s too.... not white. That and he has very little credibility. He had a great line, \"gop must stop being \u0027stupid party\u0027\", then goes and advocates for more stupidity. Now we get to cruz... What can I say about that dimwitted fuck nut that hasn\u0027t been said 1000 times or more? \n\nOn the democratic side you have Chafee, Clinton, O\u0027Malley, and Sanders.

He\u0027s not that well known. Clinton has a lot of name recognition, that can be good and bad. She\u0027s the most electable out of the bunch, on either side though, even with the negatives. O\u0027Malley looks good with the little I know about him, but he\u0027s not well known so it would be a hard fight. Probably a lot harder than Obama\u0027s. But I would put him above most of the republicans, except for bush brother in the election. Not that I would vote for the brother bush or anything, just that both of those, it would likely be bush winning the election. Now last and certainly not least... we have Sanders.... While I like him, and would definitely vote for him, I don\u0027t think he could get elected, or even win the nomination. I don\u0027t beleive he seriously thinks he can be the nominee. I believe he is just trying to not let Hilary skate through unopposed or very little opposed so that she will have an easier shot at winning. Or hopefully open the door for someone better to come in. So, I managed to list 12 people, with only 2 that has any real shot at winning. Not saying someone else couldn\u0027t, just that it\u0027s very doubtful.

Or don\u0027t want more than one person per family to run. Simply saying that they the family members would have more influence is not a legitimate argument, as that\u0027s always going to be the case. Past presidents talk to each other, or did you not know that? They still have quite a bit of sway regardless. Just saying shit to say it, really makes you seem like you are not aware of some of those fundamentals. \n\nAgain though, we don\u0027t need thousands of potentials, we just need one or two who can do the job, and do it well. If we have the next best president that could really turn this country around, and his last name is Obama, bush, Clinton, Carter, reagan, etc, etc and part of those families, then I will support them fully. It\u0027s about the person, not their lineage that really matters. I am biased against them from the start, but if they are good for the job, that will override that initial bias though.

Or something along those lines, maybe get the presidents ear a little more than most. I mean look at the bush example. Sr, I respected a bit, didn\u0027t like him, but I like him a lot more than jr. Do you think that Sr, told jr, to go into Iraq? Or advise him on anything? Or found some way to provide preferential treatment he wouldn\u0027t have otherwise have gotten? I think maybe if jr, listed to dear old pop, he may have not been the worse president, or at least a leading candidate. Maybe listen more to him than say cheany? \n\nMy overall point is that, a family doesn\u0027t matter in the grand scheme of things. What matters is \"can the person do the job\", \"can they do it well\", \"will they fuck us all to hell\"?, etc, etc. And on that metric, it should be clear. But what your logic is saying.... Is say one person is from a family who had a husband/brother as president, and let\u0027s say they are perfect for the job, and let\u0027s fast forward into a potential future, where that person being president, would benefit you, and the country greatly. Yet, by your logic, if Joe Smith, was running against them, you would be for that, since they do not represent a \"monarchy\", and even if you believed they would be terrible, you still think it would somehow be worse in your monarchy scenario. Again, it\u0027s the person that matters, not the family. If you want to diss bush, and or Clinton, and not want them to be president? Sure fine do that, There are very good arguments for both. But in reality, a dynasty is not one of them, it\u0027s noise and nothing more. It adds nothing significant to the argument when you look at it logically. I personally don\u0027t like the idea of multiple people from the same family in the whitehouse, even 5th cousins, but that\u0027s my bias, and I understand that. I just try not to let it shade logical thinking. \n\n\u0026gt;Also, I do not see your case for \"doublethink\".\n\nTo make it as simple as possible, you basically said, I don\u0027t like families in the whitehouse, but it\u0027s time to let other families have a chance in the whitehouse. Meaning you are not for another bush or Clinton, but, let\u0027s say another family, let\u0027s say Joe, and Billy Smith would be fine. The problem I think you run into is that you tried to square your initial logic, by giving yourself an out, but you cut yourself off at the knees logically speaking. Now if you wouldn\u0027t have said \"families\", and said something like another person. Then your logic would have been sound (yet not sound as good), sans doublethink. With \"families\", it introduces doublethink, as both are mutually exclusive. You can\u0027t be against families in the whitehouse, and then give a statement directly after it, saying you would be ok with families, just not those families, it severely undercuts your argument. \n\nTo try to make it as simple as I can... taking away all of the noise.. you basically said, I don\u0027t like A, and it needs to stop, but I think A should have a go... If that doesn\u0027t help you understand, I don\u0027t know what will.

If Hilary is ever elected it would be two. \n\n\u0026gt;it\u0027s your ability to comprehend it.\n\nMy comprehension ability is quite well, and unless you have some hidden meaning only known to you, I stand by what I said. \n\n\u0026gt;The previous two sentences would not have been needed if you would try to hold a conversation without insults.\n\nAgain, you are not making much sense. I don\u0027t even know how to parse something like that. The previous two sentences stand... regardless of anything I could respond with, or even attempt a conversation with. The last one negates the first two. Unless you get into the area of doublethink of course, as it appears you have no discomfort with holding two contradictory beliefs which would be the basis for cognitive dissonance. \n\n\u0026gt;It does make sense. Out of the last 28 years, 24 have been either a Clinton or a bush\n\nOk, let\u0027s do the math. The first bush was in office in 89, but let\u0027s go with the elected in 88\u0027 and let\u0027s consider the next one being 2016 so.. 28 years, you were right on that point. Now where you falter is... the first bush 88-92 \u003d 4 years. Clinton 92-00 \u003d 8 years, bush jr, 00-08 \u003d 8 years. 4 + 8 + 8 \u003d 20.. not 24. \n\n\u0026gt;why elect another Clinton\n\nThere has been 1 Clinton. It\u0027s not like they have some type of dynasty or some shit, there has been 2 bushes, yes. I can see your argument against that. But the argument of \"why elect another Clinton\", is weak as hell. If you don\u0027t like Hilary for easily found reasons then so be it, say that, and hell there would be nothing wrong with that, but making it sound like there has been more than one Clinton is just nonsensical. Or does Bill count as two people? The Clinton vs bush years \u003d 8 / 12. So if Hilary is the nominee, and she is a 1 term president it would be 12/12, 2 terms 16/12. After that point if it were to happen, I could see you saying ok why another Clinton, because by then it would have been two, and not one, that was prior. \n\n\u0026gt;when there are Literally Hundreds of Millions of other people in the US that can be president.\n\nNo, not really. You have to be 35 to be president, and within the US as a resident for the last 14 years. Now while it\u0027s possible for someone who is 35 to be president, it\u0027s incredibly unlikely. The youngest so far being Roosevelt at 42. Clinton was 46, and Obama was 47. If we take the last 10 and get an average, we get around 46.7. But hey, let\u0027s start out with 35..., Oh and the oldest being 69, almost 70.\n\nI can\u0027t find hard numbers but, doing a little math to get an estimate shouldn\u0027t hurt. According to the 2010 census. There are/were roughly \n\n20.1m - 35 to 39, \n\n20.9m - 40 to 44,\n\n22.7m - 45 to 49\n\n22.3m - 50 to 54\n\n19.6m - 55 to 59\n\n16.8m - 60 to 64\n\n12.5m - 65 to 69\n\n9.3m - 70 to 74\n\n7.3m - 75 to 79\n\n5.8m - 80 to 84\n\n3.6m - 85 to 89\n\n1.5m - 90 to 94\n\n372k - 95 to 99\n\n54k - 100+\n\nSo let\u0027s just say 163m or so. So... \"literally\", there are not \"hundreds of millions\", as would be the case if there were say 200m or more people eligible. I won\u0027t even get into the whole illegal deal, where the number would likely shrink down. Not below 100m though. Now realistically. we can take 40-69, and get a decent idea how many people would be eligible. That would be say 115m people. If you take away illegals then, it would get closer to the 100m mark. Again though \"literally\" 100\u0027s of millions of people, meaning plural, would be multiples of 100\u0027s. Since there are only around 320 million, half of the population wouldn\u0027t be considered \"hundreds\". Again, it makes it seem like you don\u0027t know what you are talking about. That wasn\u0027t an insult, it\u0027s just an observation. If you want to be taken seriously, maybe speak in a way you could? \n\n\n\u0026gt;I see your point that we\u0027ve only elected one Clinton, but why elect another?\n\nOk, that goes back to my point, where your third sentence, just completely fucks the first two... \"Time to let some other families have a go.\" If you take family at 2 or more people, it\u0027s only been one family so far. Not two. \n\n\u0026gt;The only reason she\u0027s an option is because her husband was a really good President when his pants were on.\n\nEven if Bill wasn\u0027t president, I am sure she would have been in the scene by now. She is a decent politician. Now as for the bit about \"when his pants were on\". That makes no sense still. He was president when his pants were on and off. He, I believe made deals with his dick in Lewinsky\u0027s mouth, so saying that bit, even considering the fact when he was doing that, he was still a \"good\" president. He may not have fit your, or other\u0027s morals, but he still did a decent job. Not great by any stretch, but great by comparison with the person that came after. \n\n\u0026gt;The fact the same families keep going for the white house shows that there is something wrong in the system right now of how we go about electing our top dog.\n\nYet you said \"other families have a go\". Why would you say that, if you felt that way? You seem to rail against dynasties, but then come back with saying ok, I am, or might be for it, so long as it\u0027s not a one or two tiered dynasty, but 3, sure... Do you see how that makes little to no sense? \n\nThe reason it is that way, is that politics is an insiders game. It takes a bit to get into it, and know your way around. So if you have a family member or someone close, with that inside track, you have a natural advantage. It\u0027s the same for just about any kind of job, it\u0027s just illuminated a bit more in politics. If your father/mother is a doctor, then it would be easier for you to be a doctor, as you have someone who paved the path for you, and could help you out to get there. Maybe make the path a little less bumpy? It\u0027s not something that is necessarily wrong with how we choose the president, or the system. It\u0027s a matter of how shit is, and will likely always be in the US. \n\nOh and back to the 100 mil or so people could be the president. Sure, that\u0027s theoretically possible, but so is engineering pigs to fly. Even outside of the realm of realistically possible, you would have to go with just about every politician at a state level and above, and count them, then for shits and giggles add another million to it, and you still will not be anywhere near close to what you said. Realistically though if given the proper attention, maybe, just maybe a few hundred could ever be elected. Sanders, would barely make that list. I like him, and would vote for him, but hey? We will see. He\u0027s on the out skirts of reality right now though. \n\nAlmost forgot.. \n\n\u0026gt;Try not insulting people when responding\n\nI will assume it\u0027s due to the following line\n\n\u0026gt;Also the last line, just makes it seem like you don\u0027t even know what you are talking about.\n\nMaybe your comprehension is off. I added a qualifier. \"makes it seem\". It wasn\u0027t an outright insult. It was pointing out the doublethink, of you holding two contradictory beliefs. If you say something like believing in free will, and fate at the same time. Or in religious sectors, \"gods plan\", and \"free will\". Both being mutually exclusive, where as one negates the other wholly, it\u0027s \"doublethink\". If you happen to have some conflict about holding both, like questioning it, or one or the other, then it would be cognitive dissonance. People who do that (doublethink), can be seen as... \"not knowing what they are talking about\".
