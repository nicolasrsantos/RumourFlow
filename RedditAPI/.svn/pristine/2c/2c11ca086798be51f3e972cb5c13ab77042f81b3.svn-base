How about this:

I am not a Southerner.  I am not even a Christian.  I am not even religious.  I don't believe all Muslims are our enemies, however I do believe that Islam is a misogynistic, brutal, superstitious, somewhat aggressively militaristic doctrine that's harmful to humanity at large.  I recognize that individual Muslims can sometimes avoid literalism and avoid enacting the worst parts of the Islamic doctrine.  But I also recognize that as long as these "moderates" support the Islamic doctrine as is, together with all the ahadith and various hateful and bigoted commentaries by various clerics, they are passively and quietly promoting harm.  So these folks may be peaceful and reasonable in a day to day life one on one, but then when [this happens](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9kAVlnGMTU), they won't send letters to this idiot, they won't speak up and condemn this hatred and intolerance.  These are not good behaviors.
&gt;So, it's exactly like Christianity then, only with brown people.

I would say that's a false equivalence.  I think that while there is a lot to criticize about both Christianity and Islam, Islam is not in fact exactly like Christianity.  Islam is markedly more brutal and markedly more militaristic and political than Christianity is, when it comes to central doctrinal writings and how they are usually interpreted.

I don't know any Christian nation or even any currently practicing Christian sect that stones adulterers or amputates limbs for theft.  While Christians have crusaded in the past, there is no doctrinal support for crusading in the Bible.  At the same time, there is doctrinal support for military jihad in both the Qur'an and ahadith, which are the doctrinal writings of Islam.

So, to my mind there are some significant differences between the Christian doctrine and the Islamic one.  I don't like either doctrine, but the Islamic doctrine is significantly more harmful.
And I do find both doctrines reprehensible, but not nearly in equal measure.

In Christianity Jesus overrides most of the nastiness from the Old Testament.  In Islam Mohammed positively asserts, defends and even performs nastiness from the Old Testament, plus he adds some of his own, like limb amputations (which, as far as I know, do not exist in the Old Testament, correct me if I am wrong).  Jesus stopped a stoning that was about to commence.  Mohammed would initiate the stonings rather than stop them.  I'm just scratching the surface here.  There are lots of differences between Jesus and Mohammed.  Jesus preached to turn the other cheek and he practiced what he preached by allowing himself to be nailed to the cross.  Mohammed became a warlord later in his life.  Jesus didn't fuck anyone, as far as I know.  Mohammed fucked a 9 year old girl and he had many wives as well (I dislike polygamy too, but the 9 year old is unforgivable).  What a difference.

I can't pretend that Islam is equally as bad as Christianity just to be politically correct on reddit.  I've read enough of the Bible, Qur'an and ahadith to know otherwise.
&gt;Jesus did not change anything from the old testament

No, he did.  He definitely did change quite a few things.  I am well aware of the lines you are quoting too.  Do yourself a favor and look into it more.  He didn't change all of the Old Testament, but he certainly changes big chunks of it, and all changes for the better too.

If you compare personal conduct of Jesus and Mohammed, there is no ambiguity in my mind about who is morally superior.  I'd be OK with someone trying to emulate Jesus, but I would definitely **not** be OK with anyone trying to emulate Mohammed.

It's definitely a great shame that Jesus didn't summarily cancel the Old Testament though.
&gt;Counting the first, second, third, and modern crusades?

I count doctrines first and foremost, and then I count how those doctrines influence the cultures adopting them second.

So yes, I am definitely counting the crusades (military adventures in the name of religion).  I count everything when I speak about Islam and Christianity here.
To the extent that is so, yes, definitely.  I would expect Christians to strongly and vocally oppose someone like Kony.  Similarly, when various Christian anti-gay bigots go to Uganda to proselytize, I'd expect opposition from Christians.  Well, guess what?  I don't like Christians or Christianity.  It's just that Islam is worse, imo.  Ideally I don't want any Abrahamic religion to be practiced.  But if I had to pick either Christianity or Islam to be my neighboring doctrine of influence, I'd pick Christianity over Islam any day.
I disagree with this analysis.  I know lots of areas that suffer from abject poverty which don't turn to any kind of fundamentalism.

I also know fundamentalists which are more harmless the more hardcore they are: Jains.  The more fundamentalist a Jain is, the more harmless one is.
&gt;If there were moderates would you hear them on FOX news ?

How about reddit?

&gt;Do Muslim moderates actively fit into the American narrative about Islam and its adherents ?

Best way to find out is to talk to them yourself.  Seriously.  Internet is good for that.

&gt;Do you actively search for moderate Muslim opinions 

I mostly look at doctrinal writings, but I've talked to Muslims a few times on reddit and offline.  I'm not going to say they are all crazy lunatics, that's just false.  But plenty of times I talked to Muslims I walked away disappointed and sad.  They really don't say stuff I wish they would say.  And while I can see how they are aligning with the doctrine, in my mind I think, "guys, don't you see how the doctrine is inadequate?"  Of course once you become a true believer, and you accept that the doctrine is the word of the omniscient God, what chance is there to think critically about it?  So if you think I don't encounter this in a discussion with Muslims, you're wrong.

Anyway, I don't really hate the individual Muslims, but I *am* concerned about the doctrine.  I worry that Muslims promote Islam without giving any thought to the impact the doctrine has on humanity.  I watched some conversion videos on youtube, and almost invariably the reason people convert to Islam is not because of the doctrine, but because of how good they feel about some Muslim friends on a personal level.  That's a serious concern because while these folks probably don't read all of Qur'an, don't read ahadith, don't study Muslim history in all their gory details, may not know what "Deobandi thinking" is and so on, they decide it's a good idea to support and directly or indirectly help spread this dangerous doctrine just because they feel good about a person.  That's just unsound thinking.  If you're going to adopt a religion, nice community is a good thing for sure, but **do** check out the doctrine first and foremost, and try to understand what it is you are spreading.

Also people who hide the ugly side of the doctrine while putting out fuzzy feelings up-front are dishonest salesmen.  You know how lots of people get converted?  From Sufism.  And Sufis don't talk about amputating limbs.  They don't get on a podium and get angry like a lot of Muslim clerics.  They smile.  They are kind.  They talk about nice fuzzy mystical stuff.  They never mention the harsh side of Islam.  So... on one hand, as Muslims, Sufis are probably some of the better people.  But as salesmen for Islam, Sufis are the most dishonest salesmen.  They put forward the very best of Islam, and absolutely obscure or even deny the worst.  I can even see myself hanging out with a Sufi sheikh and enjoying it.  But I would never convert to Islam.  And I would lean over and whisper into the sheikh's ear, "Don't convert anyone to Islam... just share your spiritual wisdom as is."  And thankfully I even know of some sheikhs who do exactly that, but not enough, imo.

How many Muslims say stuff like this, "Converting to Islam is free, but if you ever de-convert, be careful, because a lot of Muslims believe that ideally you should be punished by death for apostasy!"  If Muslims talked this way, I bet they'd get a lot fewer converts.  That, and mentioning other similar things about Islamic doctrine, its often violent history and its often strict and intolerant culture would be an honest sales job at least.

Thing to remember is... while you may just want a bunch of cool buddies to hang with, someone else is going to read the doctrinal writings of Islam and actually take them both literally and seriously.  And then what?  What kind of world are we creating?
&gt;You've got to understand that most of that bullshit you see from extreme Muslims is cultural - not religious. 

Sorry, I am in a firm disagreement with you here.

&gt;The regions where the muslim crazies come from didn't have the benefit of an age of reason

Why not?  Ever thought about it?

&gt;Religion is a part of it but it's not the whole picture..

I agree.  But religion, sadly, is an important part of the whole picture.  Why so?  Because religious identity, sadly, is a very important kind of identity, still, for a lot of people.

&gt;Where are the Turkish suicide bombers?

Let's wait.  Turkey is in the middle of Islamization.  Besides, Turkey's recent rulers have been militantly secularistic.  You can't give Turkey 100% credit for secularism that was not of their free will.  It's like giving USSR citizens credit for being atheistic at a time when atheism was a government mandate in USSR.  That's crooked thinking.

&gt;It's easy to blame Islam for some of the stupid shit muslim extremists do

Extremism in the form of militancy is one of the problems.  But there are other problems.  Islamic attitude toward women.  Islamic attitude toward dogs and liquor.  Islamic ideas about punishment (very brutal and cruel).  Islamic attitude toward non-Muslims.  Islamic attitude toward apostasy.  In other words, even in a Muslim society where people don't strap the suicide vests on, you can often see the negative influence of Islam.  And the more Muslims in one place the worse it usually goes.  Muslims are at their best when they are very dispersed in low numbers across the West.  But get a bunch of them together, especially in the Middle East, Africa or India, and bad shit happens.  Militarism is just one bad dimension of Islam.  That's the jihad dimension.  But Islam has plenty of bad dimensions besides militarism.

&gt;if you blame Islam you're going to have to label every single moderate Muslim a potential extremist

Moderate Muslims provide a comfortable and supportive atmosphere for the more serious Muslims.  They may not support extremism directly, but they support a Muslim who is marginally more serious.  Then the marginally more serious Muslims supports another marginally more serious Muslim.  And so on.  So at the end of the day, everyone plays a part in making Islam what it is.  Moderates make Islam what it is by their silence and apathy in the face of Islamic excesses.  Also, even moderates won't criticize the Qur'an.  \*sigh\*

I don't want to sit here and pretend Islamic doctrine is acceptable when it isn't.  I don't want to slaughter every Muslim or anything like that.  In fact I want the wars to end as much as possible.  However, I also think we need to speak out about Islam.  We've got to criticize it.
There is definitely a bit of reddit's own flavor of political correctness and groupthink.  Mostly it's not too bad, actually.
But when will Mitt produce a *real* birth certificate?  Anyone can produce a forgery.  Just ask Barack.
