How many drones were available to Bush vs Obama?  My point is, that the argument would hold some sort of validity if Bush refused to use drones in lieu of pilots.  I\u0027d guarantee that he didn\u0027t use drones more because there were only a limited amount during the early aughts, and even less so that were equipped properly for the missions.   \n  \nMay it also be noted that while I do not agree with everything that Obama has done, he did not invade a foreign country under false pretenses yet, and then claim mission accomplished when in fact nothing was accomplished and the mess was left to the next administration.  (and it looks like the next admin after that).","duration":"","id":77,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_ckxpxhl","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":76,"links":[75],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"PolitricksFooledYou","label":"Drones have existed since the 90s but the first targeted killing occurred on [February 4, 2002](http://www.thenation.com/article/166124/brief-history-drones) making the yearly totals of drone use for both presidents around 6 years...\n\none president is considered a war criminal, the other has a nobel peace prize...
