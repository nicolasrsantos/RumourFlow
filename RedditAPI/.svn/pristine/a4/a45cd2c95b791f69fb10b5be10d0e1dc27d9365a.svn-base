You\u0027re both forced to join a cooperative where you have to teach your neighbor how to take care of his cow.\r\n\r\nBureaucratic Socialism: You have two cows. The government takes them and puts them in a barn with everyone else\u0027s cows. They are cared for by ex-chicken farmers. You have to take care of the chickens the government took from the chicken farmers. The government gives you as much milk and as many eggs as its regulations say you should need.\r\n\r\nFascism: You have two cows. The government takes both, hires you to take care of them, and sells you the milk.\r\n\r\nPure Communism: You have two cows. Your neighbors help you take care of them, and you all share the milk.\r\n\r\nRussian Communism: You have two cows. You have to take care of them, but the government takes all the milk.\r\n\r\nCommunism: You have two cows. The government seizes both and provides you with milk.

The government takes both and shoots you.\r\n\r\nMilitarism: You have two cows. The government takes both and drafts you.\r\n\r\nPure Democracy: You have two cows. Your neighbors decide who gets the milk.\r\n\r\nRepresentative Democracy: You have two cows. Your neighbors pick someone to tell you who gets the milk.\r\n\r\nAmerican Democracy: The government promises to give you two cows if you vote for it. After the election, the president is impeached for speculating in cow futures. The press dubs the affair \"Cowgate.\" The cows are set free.\r\n\r\nDemocracy, Democrat-style: You have two cows. Your neighbor has none. You feel guilty for being so successful. You vote politicians into office who tax your cows, which forces you to sell one to pay the tax. The politicians use the tax money to buy a cow for your neighbor. You feel good. Barbra Streisand sings for you.\r\n\r\nDemocracy, Republican-style: You have two cows. Your neighbor has none. You move to a better neighborhood.\r\nIndian Democracy: You have two cows. You worship them.\r\n\r\nBritish Democracy: You have two cows. You feed them sheep brains and they go mad. The government gives you compensation for your diseased cows, compensation for your lost income, and a grant not to use your fields for anything else. And tells the public not to worry.\r\n\r\nBureaucracy: You have two cows. At first the government regulates what you can feed them and when you can milk them. Then it pays you not to milk them.

The government bans you from milking or killing them.\r\n\r\nTotalitarianism: You have two cows. The government takes them and denies they ever existed. Milk is banned.\r\nForeign Policy, American-Style: You have two cows. The government taxes them and uses the money to buy a cow for a poor farmer a country ruled by a dictator. The farmer has no hay to feed the cow and his religion forbids him from eating it. The cow dies. The man dies. The dictator confiscates the dead man\u0027s farm and sells it, using the money to purchase US military equipment. The President declares the program a success and announces closer ties with our new ally.\r\n\r\nBureaucracy, American-Style: You have two cows but you have to kill one of them because the government will only give you a license for one of them. The license requires you to sell all your milk to the government, which uses it to make cheese. The government pays lots of money to store the cheese in refrigerated warehouses. When the cheese spoils, the government distributes it to the poor. The poor get sick from the cheese, go to the emergency room, and are turned away because they have no health insurance. The President declares the program a success and reminds us that we have the finest health care system in the world.\r\n\r\nAmerican Corporation: You have two cows. You sell one to a subsidiary company and lease it back to yourself so you can declare it as a tax loss. Your bosses give you a huge bonus. You inject the cows with drugs and they produce four times the normal amount of milk. Your bosses give you a huge bonus. When the drugs cause one of the cows to drop dead you announce to the press that you have down-sized, reducing expenses by 50 percent. The company stock goes up and your bosses give you a huge bonus. You lay off all your workers and move your production facilities to Mexico. You get a huge bonus. You contribute some of your profit to the President\u0027s re-election campaign. The President announces tax cuts for corporations in order to stimulate the economy.\r\n\r\nJapanese Corporation: You have two cows.

One mistake in the other points is to conflate different *groups* of republicans and assume they all think the same; another mistake is to attribute specifically to Republicans views which are common in US national politics across the political spectrum. (To the extent that the latter was done we could call the list \"Things only a politician could believe\".)\n\nExamples of conflating groups:\n*\"God told Bush to invade Iraq\"*: It would actually be pretty difficult to find a republican who claims to believe that. Some such surely exist, but it\u0027s not a traditional Republican belief. \n\n*\"Jesus will return in our lifetimes\"*: Ditto. Yes, it\u0027s an obviously crazy belief, and yes, people who hold it are more likely to be Republicans than Democrats, but that doesn\u0027t mean people who are Republicans are especially likely to hold those beliefs or even that this belief is uniquely Republican.\n\nExample of conventional wisdom:\n*\"Anyone who abuses drugs should be locked up indefinitely\"*. This belief is obviously stupid, but the War on Drugs is an entirely *bipartisan* form of stupidity. That locking up drug users is a good idea is what *all US politicians believe* if we are to judge them by their actions. The Democrats have made no attempt to end the war on drugs when they have been in power. In fact, some of the strongest arguments for relaxing the drug laws have come from the right. Milton Friedman [favored legalizing drugs](http://www.forbes.com/2005/06/02/cz_qh_0602pot.html) as far back in the 1970s; even [William F. Buckley eventually came around](http://www.nationalreview.com/buckley/buckley200406291207.asp) to advocating marijuana decriminalization. So how can we hold the drug war up as something \"Only a Republican Could Believe\"?\n\n(for what it\u0027s worth, I\u0027m a libertarian; I agree with the original poster that republicans have a lot of dumb ideas and inconsistencies)","duration":"","id":471,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_c0cthk2","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":470,"links":[438],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"myerscarpenter","label":"so if we make the correction from \"automatic weapon\" to \"assault rifle\" you agree with all the other points?","duration":"","id":470,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_c0ctcwp","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":438,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"glenra","label":"\u0026gt; showing up with automatic weapons to protest healthcare reform is democracy at its finest.\n\nNobody has yet shown up at a protest with an  \"automatic weapon\".

And yes, those who believe and repeat the story that Bush said that God told him to invade Iraq are pretty crazy.\n\n\u0026gt;The media are unquestionably biased against Republicans -- Talk Radio, The Washington Times, The Weekly Standard, The Wall Street Journal, Rightwing Blogs, Fox News and NewsCorp are not part of the media.\n\nTrue, the media is pretty pinko, as can easily be seen by analyzing the content.

Furthermore, blogs and talk radio do not count as hard news media.\n\n\u0026gt;The government should have no part in regulating multi-national corporations as they make decisions that impact the lives of millions of people -- government should regulate individuals by determining who they can marry, what kind of intercourse they can have, what they can smoke, how to manage their pregnancy and how to proceed with end of life decisions.\n\nTrue, the government should only punish force and fraud.\n\n\u0026gt;Iran is a mortal threat to our nation and anyone who attempts to talk to them is traitorous scum -- selling weapons to Iran and then funneling the money to start wars in South America is clearly in our National interest.\n\nInsofar as Reagan was trying to stop the Soviets from gaining additional foothold in Latin America, I would definitely say that was in our national interest.\n\n\u0026gt;George Bush kept the nation safe after 9-11 (NOTE: the Anthrax attacks, the DC Sniper and Hurricane Katrina don\u0027t count.

Required prayer time in public schools amounts to \"forced,\" especially given how difficult it is for a child to defy the norm everyone else sets. I\u0027m not sure what \"Gaia worship\" is, unless you\u0027re talking about Greek mythology (which is taught as *mythology*), and I\u0027m not sure how LGBT studies are related to prayer.\n\nRegarding the Supreme Court decision, while what you said may be true, the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction over the election, which is worse than the Florida Supreme Court doing the same.\n\n\u0026gt;Fascists are indeed socialists, and Marxism is Communism\n\nSocialism is an economic system (compare with capitalism). [Marxism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism) was uses socialism as its economic vehicle, but includes the worker\u0027s revolution and is generally an entire theory of government (in a manner of speaking).

And you either buy it or don\u0027t care.\n\n\n\n\u0026gt;during the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, many communists happily identified themselves as both communists and fascists. \n\nCite please, I have studied the subject and I have never heard of anyone doing that.\n\n\u0026gt;True, the media is pretty pinko, as can easily be seen by analyzing the content.\n\nThis is the \"facts have a liberal bias\" problem, right? \n\n","duration":"","id":492,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_c0cttla","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":485,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"andrew1193","label":"\u0026gt;Parents who don\u0027t want their children to pray in school are Anti-American zealots -- parents who don\u0027t want their children to listen to a speech by the President of the United States telling them to work hard and get good grades are noble patriots.\n\nNobody has forced children to pray in schools. What your side is doing is not only suppressing those who choose to pray to the Christian god, but indoctrinating children in crap like Gaia worship and \"LGBT studies\".\n\n\u0026gt;Questioning the legitimacy of an election because the \"winner\" was selected by the Supreme Court is sour grapes -- questioning the legitimacy of an election because the winner (by the largest number of votes in American history) is really a Kenyan born Muslim despite all evidence to the contrary is being a vigilant American.\n\nThat is correct, it is illegitimate to say that the supreme Court \"selected\" the President in the 2000 election, when in fact they acted to prevent the Florida Supreme Court from unconstitutionally usurping election authority from the Florida legislature.\n\n\u0026gt;Socialism, Marxism, Communism and Fascism are all interchangeable words that mean pretty much the same thing.\n\nFascists are indeed socialists, and Marxism is Communism. Furthermore, during the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, many communists happily identified themselves as both communists and fascists. Those who believe there is a big difference between any of them is in favor of at least one of them.\n\n\u0026gt;Believing that human activity could impact the global environment is crazy talk -- believing that an invisible man in the sky personally told George Bush to invade Iraq to fulfill Biblical prophecy is logically sound.\n\nBelieving that human activity could impact the global environment in some small way is not crazy talk. Gaia theory that treats humans as parasites **is** crazy talk. And yes, those who believe and repeat the story that Bush said that God told him to invade Iraq are pretty crazy.\n\n\u0026gt;The media are unquestionably biased against Republicans -- Talk Radio, The Washington Times, The Weekly Standard, The Wall Street Journal, Rightwing Blogs, Fox News and NewsCorp are not part of the media.\n\nTrue, the media is pretty pinko, as can easily be seen by analyzing the content. As for the Washington Times, its circulation pales in comparison to the Washington Post or the New York Times. The same is true with The Weekly Standard as compared with Time or Newsweek. Furthermore, blogs and talk radio do not count as hard news media.\n\n\u0026gt;The government should have no part in regulating multi-national corporations as they make decisions that impact the lives of millions of people -- government should regulate individuals by determining who they can marry, what kind of intercourse they can have, what they can smoke, how to manage their pregnancy and how to proceed with end of life decisions.\n\nTrue, the government should only punish force and fraud.\n\n\u0026gt;Iran is a mortal threat to our nation and anyone who attempts to talk to them is traitorous scum -- selling weapons to Iran and then funneling the money to start wars in South America is clearly in our National interest.\n\nInsofar as Reagan was trying to stop the Soviets from gaining additional foothold in Latin America, I would definitely say that was in our national interest.\n\n\u0026gt;George Bush kept the nation safe after 9-11 (NOTE: the Anthrax attacks, the DC Sniper and Hurricane Katrina don\u0027t count. Also, the fact that 9-11 happened on his watch despite receiving a security briefing specifically warning of the attack doesn\u0027t count either.)\n\nCorrect, vague warnings do not count. At any rate, if Bush did anything substantial in response to that warning, you people would be hollering from the rooftops that he was imposing police-state fascism and/or being a warmonger.\n\n\u0026gt;Social Security, Meidcare, public schooling, public libraries, fire departments, police departments and the US Military are as American as Apple Pie -- universal healthcare is ZOMGDEATHPANELSOCIALISM!!\n\nI don\u0027t know very many Republicans who believe Social Security and Medicare are as \"American as Apple Pie\".\n\n\u0026gt;George W Bush is a regular \u0027ole Texas rancher just like you and me despite the fact that he was born in Connecticut, attended two Ivy League schools, bought the Crawford ranch just before running for president, sold it immediate after leaving office and is terrified of horses.\n\n...after living in Texas for most of his life, and becoming governor of that state.","duration":"","id":485,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c0ctgqn","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Things Only a Republican Could Believe","label":"tpaulman","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_9hmmm","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.252194369E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.252214247E9,"simScore":0.8231336046140278,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.252241253E9,"simScore":0.5018126449318571,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.252241253E9,"simScore":0.3983786220170946,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.252472975E9,"simScore":0.3972978966844293,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.252474931E9,"simScore":0.36522490260361373,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.252735688E9,"simScore":0.5665660102188815,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":497,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"kazter","label":"I\u0027d just like to point out that you stated you were an Independent.

Satire is an effective weapon against craziness!\n\n\n.\n\n\nI make no apologies if you consider yourself a Republican. I am a registered Independent and have voted Republican at various levels of government, but the current crop of Republicans at the national level are off the reservation. To call them bat shit crazy would be an insult to bat shit.\n\n\n.\n\n\n**Things Only a Republican Could Believe:**\n\n* Parents who don\u0027t want their children to pray in school are Anti-American zealots -- parents who don\u0027t want their children to listen to a speech by the President of the United States telling them to work hard and get good grades are noble patriots.\n\n* Peacefully demonstrating against the country starting an international war is treason -- showing up with automatic weapons to protest healthcare reform is democracy at its finest.\n\n* Any government official with a desk job should have every action scrutinized -- any government official with a badge and a gun should never be questioned or disrespected. At all. Ever.\n\n* Questioning the legitimacy of an election because the \"winner\" was selected by the Supreme Court is sour grapes -- questioning the legitimacy of an election because the winner (by the largest number of votes in American history) is really a Kenyan born Muslim despite all evidence to the contrary is being a vigilant American.\n\n* Lying about a blowjob is an impeachable offense -- lying about a war is no big deal, really.\n\n* Investigating a shady land deal involving the First Lady is a matter of National Identity -- investigating the use of torture at the direction of the Executive Branch is a partisan witch hunt.\n\n* Executing Japanese officers for waterboarding prisoners during WWII shows that we have the moral high-ground on human rights -- waterboarding prisoners of our shows that we have the moral high-ground on human rights.\n\n* Sitting two rows in front of Jane Fonda in a 1970 anti-war rally is an OUTRAGE! Shaking Saddam\u0027s hand in 1983...meh, not so much.\n\n* Anyone who questions the president during a time of war is giving aide and comfort to the enemy and should be deported...unless the president in question has a (D) next to their name in which case you should undermine them at every turn even if you have to routinely make shit up to do it.\n\n* Socialism, Marxism, Communism and Fascism are all interchangeable words that mean pretty much the same thing.\n\n* Anyone who abuses drugs should be locked up indefinitely...unless they are a popular Republican radio host in which case they need your prayers as they recover from the illness of addiction.\n\n* Health Insurance companies have your best interests in mind and anyone who thinks otherwise is trying to turn America into the Godless heathen nation of Sweden where EVERYONE in the country dies (eventually).\n\n* Obama is an atheist communist muslim who attended a radical christian church.\n\n* Believing that human activity could impact the global environment is crazy talk -- believing that an invisible man in the sky personally told George Bush to invade Iraq to fulfill Biblical prophecy is logically sound.\n\n* The verdict is still out on evolution -- but Jesus Christ returning in our lifetimes is a pretty much a given.\n\n* The media are unquestionably biased against Republicans -- Talk Radio, The Washington Times, The Weekly Standard, The Wall Street Journal, Rightwing Blogs, Fox News and NewsCorp are not part of the media.\n\n* The government should have no part in regulating multi-national corporations as they make decisions that impact the lives of millions of people -- government should regulate individuals by determining who they can marry, what kind of intercourse they can have, what they can smoke, how to manage their pregnancy and how to proceed with end of life decisions.\n\n* Communicating with hostile nations is a stab in the back to our great nation -- Reagan communicating with the USSR during the Cold War was Political Genius.\n\n* Iran is a mortal threat to our nation and anyone who attempts to talk to them is traitorous scum -- selling weapons to Iran and then funneling the money to start wars in South America is clearly in our National interest.\n\n* George Bush kept the nation safe after 9-11 (NOTE: the Anthrax attacks, the DC Sniper and Hurricane Katrina don\u0027t count. Also, the fact that 9-11 happened on his watch despite receiving a security briefing specifically warning of the attack doesn\u0027t count either.)\n\n* Social Security, Meidcare, public schooling, public libraries, fire departments, police departments and the US Military are as American as Apple Pie -- universal healthcare is ZOMGDEATHPANELSOCIALISM!!\n\n* George W Bush is a regular \u0027ole Texas rancher just like you and me despite the fact that he was born in Connecticut, attended two Ivy League schools, bought the Crawford ranch just before running for president, sold it immediate after leaving office and is terrified of horses.\n\n* The two guys at the center of the Watergate and Iran-Contra scandals are trustworthy voices in discussions of current national policy and should be taken at face-value.","selftextHTML":"\u0026lt;!-- SC_OFF --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div class\u003d\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So, y\u0026amp;#39;all remember that email that went around years ago called \u0026amp;quot;Things Only a Republican Could Believe\u0026amp;quot;?
