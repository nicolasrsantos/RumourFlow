As a republican,when I heard other republicans say Obama is a Muslim I automatically assume they are ignorant of all politics.  As a democrat, what is something you hear from other democrats that makes you hardcore face-palm?
I enjoyed mittens, lol.
&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;
Or assuming all religious people MUST be republican.
I know of at least one...
Skril...dangit.
GET HIM!
Wait.  People commented saying 100k isn't a lot?!

I wish.
Romney hates big bird.

Obama apologized for America, therefore he hates America.
But really?  They played off the "big bird" thing way to much.

It just goes to show who their audience is.  Instead of hitting on the key point to his statement, they just went straight for "Romney hates big bird".
But seriously, have you held one of the healing crystals of Sedona?
Watch out for bananas.
Correction.  Your state at least has conceal and carry.  My state has nothing.
Or excusing all of the mentioned reasons in the first paragraph with the phrase, "Well Bush got us into the war".
I personally cannot stand when someone (both sides do it) uses the other candidate's actions to justify their candidates actions wen clearly both set of actions were wrong.
And visa-versa, as a Repub I can't stand people who think every welfare recipient, or even *most*, are abusing the system.  If I'm not mistaken *most* are elderly. [I think I heard 70%].
I would argue that organic is better.  I don't think that's crazy.
cool, thanks for the link.
I agree with this, except that they can't test for alcohol very easily, I think this should include tobacco products as well, and its very easy to pass a drug test with fake, or someone else's, urine.

edit: unless they are supervised, which I don't think they are.
Do...Do I win?
There are other parties [green party, libertarian party, justice party, constitution party] but they receive less tan 10% combined of the votes.

I'm not sure the exact semantics behind us being reduced to two main parties, but im sure it has to do with history and parties being so similar that they would merge to have a stronger vote.
Well Romney *is* a Mormon.
I agree, because I hate the other side of things, as I'm sure most Christians do.

Not wanting to vote for ______ because he believes in the Bible/creation/etc.
Agreed.  A friend at work started a trend by spreading one of the dumb videos.  I promptly showed him a website that shows how everything in those videos are fake, lies, or explainable, and he still chooses to believe them.
Eh, I wouldn't go that far.  I went vegan for a week and man its tough.  You will meet a lot of vegans who actually prefer to keep it to themselves, and hate saying it out loud.  When someone says they are vegan, the attacks don't stop.  Even for myself, trying it out for a week, people would not stop asking me why.

I would eat a salad, they would ask why, I'd tell them because im trying to cut back on meat, they would ask why, I would tell them I want to try vegan for a week, they would ask why, I would tell them I've heard it healthier and wanted to give it a try, [insert redneck I love bacon comment], I'd laugh, they'd tell me I'm stupid and can't survive without meat, blah blah.  Its quite annoying actually.
Ahh, they're in my eyes!
Right!  This is 'Murica.  Not Germany.
He was in front of it.
Well anti-abortion is not strict to just religious people.  The debate is when life begins.  Some people will even argue that life doesn't begin until a couple weeks AFTER the baby is born.  So in their eyes, killing your kid after its born would be ok, just like abortion.  Those who think that life begins at conception don't want abortion to be legal because they believe its 100% murder.

You can't expect someone who honestly believes that there is a life being murdered to not fight for that things right to live.

And there is no real way to "prove" when life begins because its all based on perception of what life is, etc.  So in my eyes, both sides hold a strong argument.  I will fight for my side to win, but in the end I understand where both sides come from.
Why?  I actually think that statement is pretty ignorant.

I would compare that to people who say "blacks who don't support Obama".
So your only argument for why women shouldn't vote Republican is because Republicans think that a person's life begins at conception, therefore abortion is murder, therefore they think it should be illegal?
So because of one man you should completely switch parties?
So you're saying that because there are a few, and I do mean a few [percentage wise, even 100 would not make a dent in the amount of republicans that are out there] a women should completely change what she believes in?  What is she is pro-gun, anti-abortion, pro-religious right, believes welfare needs reformed, believes government should be small?  All of that matters little because there are 20 guys who made ridiculous comments about rape.  You make little sense.

Also you keep using this term "womans rights" and I have yet to hear you say how the Republican platform is against them.  The platform, not some members, but the actual platform.

That's like saying Christians should not call themselves Christians because of Westboro Baptist church.

I know plenty of women who think abortion is murder.  Therefore that is not a right.

They also believe that an establishment that is religious should not be forced to give away something [birth control] if they do not believe in it.

Those are the two main ones that I think you are being brainwashed into thinking Republicans hate women.


Read the article, and thought it was laughable at best.  It brought up equal pay.  I urge you to look at the real statistics.  The ones that show that women actual make equal if not more than Men when you factor in all the variables.  Women in the IT field make more than men for example.

It's quite obvious to me that you are the definition of why I started this thread.  You are not open to any one else's ideas and you believe that yours are the only ones out there.

Do I understand why some women would be upset about not being allowed to kill their babies, get free stuff from the government, and make more money than men?  Sure.  Who wouldn't want those things.
I love people's reaction when I tell them they are actually pretty moderate.  And then prove it to them.
I have looked it up, and it's true.  Honestly, look it up.

You can't overdose on it.  It won't poison you.  It's not physically addicting.

People OD on alcohol.  Tobacco causes cancer [marijuana has been shown to reduce tumor sizes].  Hence them killing people.
I would actually say that some of the democrats claims towards republicans make me laugh.

For example.  "Why won't you vote for Obama?  Because he's black?"  /facepalm
That's the point of the thread.  I may be republican, but I don't think all democrats are idiots.  I think anyone who thinks the other party members are all morons are extremely ignorant of the fact that everyone has different ideologies.  No one is "right".  We all want whats best for our intentions, and that doesn't make us wrong.
Do you visit r/politics?
That doesn't make it right...
I felt as if you were defending what the democrats are saying because "republicans say it too".
As someone who has money in banks, I can confirm this.
No. http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/weddingring.asp
And now, black people can be mormon too!
