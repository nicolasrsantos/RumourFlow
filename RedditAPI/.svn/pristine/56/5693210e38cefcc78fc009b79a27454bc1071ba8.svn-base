This is called [gene therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy).\n\nHIV (as with all retroviruses) has the ability to modify the DNA of a host cell that it infects. This is a key part of how HIV infects the human body, but it also represents a potentially very useful tool for intentional genetic manipulation of already-living people (as opposed to modifying the genes of a sperm or egg cell before it grows into a new human).\n\nIf you strip out the virus' more harmful properties and reprogram it to apply a given change to the DNA of the cell it ends up in, then you can effectively change the DNA in some of the patient's cells. A virus used in this fashion is referred to as a [viral vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_vector). If perfected, this could be huge—you can do all kinds of neat (or horrifying) things to a human body if you can rewrite its genes like that.\n\nThe most obvious application of such a thing is to cure genetic diseases by undoing the genetic mutation that caused them. There's also the possibility of reprogramming the patient's cells to do more novel things, like attacking cancerous cells in this article.\n\nNote that you can't change the DNA in *all* of a patient's cells. For one thing, the [blood-brain barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood-brain_barrier) prevents many viruses, engineered or otherwise, from messing with the central nervous system. Good thing, too, or you'd probably go stark raving mad every time you caught so much as a flu!

The ones used in treatment of cancer are called Oncolytic (cancer cell killing) viruses. The overall premise is pretty simple if you understand the concepts behind a virus and a tumor cell. What does a virus do inside our body? It infects and kills cells, and spreads within an organ tissue. What is a tumor? A malignant type tumor (cancerous) is a tissue packed with growing tumor cells. The oncolytic virus, in this case the retrovirus can infect the tumor cells, this will cause the oncolytic virus to replicate inside the cells and eventually lyse them (kill them), so eventually the virus will replicate inside the tumor cells, lyse them and spread to neighboring tumor cells. Its not as simple as that though, these viruses have to be modified. You have to look at 4 things, 1) modification for selective entry into tumor cells, 2) modification for selective replication in tumor cells, 3) using tumor-specific promoters to drive essential viral gene expression, and 4) viruses with natal ability to replicate in malignant cells. Whenever a cell is infected or becomes cancerous, it usually produces a type of beacon on the surface of said cell to let the immune system know its infected. There is much more science behind this but hope this helps, we've been using this method for awhile now.

It was probably the best job I could get in my local area. I don't even want to sleep or be stuck in one place all the time. I just don't have a choice. It's hormonal changes, inside your body. Not a conscious decision. I feel labelling it as a mental illness isn't fair. It has got to the stage now where I'm sure that my immune system is weakened. Thanks to my selective appetite and bad health brought on by demotivation.. I worry that there may be serious problems with me. I'm too scared.. too sad and too demotivated to get confirmation. I don't want to let go but my mind says just let it happen. Even thinking about going to find it is too much of a task.\n\nIt's such a shame. There was a time when I embraced everyone and everything. I loved life. Truly. Having survived a fatal disease as a child, I would live every single moment to the full. What I would give to have that feeling back. Charisma. Confidence. All of it. Now my family all hate me. I feel like a burden, wanting to apologise but to no avail. It won't change. I've failed university. Lost my job. My life dreams... slipped through my fingers. I can almost cry my heart out at will, I'm so sad and empty inside. Watched my perfect life fade away before my eyes countless times now. It is always going from bad to worse. The thing is, I know I'm capable of great things. My mind is just stuck in this bad place. Not allowing me to perform these great things. Just.. Why bother. I'm never as good as I could have been by now. As I should have been. Even though I know it could all be so much worse and is for so many people...My lack of ability to focus and devote myself to anything these days means I never will get better either.\n\nIt's been a really long time for you.

I can't really offer advice but I'm not going to say hang in there or chin up like those clueless folk. I've just learned that only you can best yourself. You're still here.

There should be no federal funding for something as divided as abortion. Planned Parenthood was started by Margaret Sanger, an outspoken and self-identified eugenicist and Marxist radical.

As we know, during Sanger's time, the largest \"inferior\" and \"feeble-minded\" group was the Black demographic.\n\nPlanned Parenthood, under the pretext of helping distressed communities, began advising mothers and facilitating abortion in Black neighborhoods, oddly focusing on African-Americans more so than any other economically troubled groups/regions. Since then, while Black women only make up a tiny fraction of the entire United States population (perhaps 5-6%, if my memory serves), they now constitute more than 1/3rd of all abortions.\n\nConsidering the fact that there have been over 10,000,000 abortions (including mid and late terms), since 2001 or 2003, we can only imagine how much of the black population in the United States has never seen the light of day. \n\nEven if you are pro-choice, Planned Parenthood is sketchy.","duration":"","id":526,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c1hgmpu","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4,"level":5,"title":"The U.S. House of Representatives has just voted to bar Planned Parenthood health centers from all federal funding for birth control, cancer screenings, HIV testing, and other lifesaving care.

I'm no medical expert, but from my understanding UTIs are much more common in uncircumcised baby boys. I, personally am not a fan of circumcision, but I can almost empathize a little with a parent who might just be trying to make their baby healthier and more comfortable (UTIs are typically not dangerous from what I know, but they can lead to kidney infections. I have no clue about the risks of UTIs in infancy though).\n\nIs this strong enough to warrant an operation? No. Probably not. Maybe in extreme cases? I don't even know if they exist! I think that people think of circumcising a baby like they do piercing the ears--a \"procedure\" if you will, not really an \"operation\". \n\nThere is a book titled: \"As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as A Girl\" (I have seen a documentary about it also), it really paints a picture of why parents may look into circumcision (or be guided there by a physician to help the baby), the fucking dangers of it, and lots more--its a great read; although it is insanely tragic.

the HIV guy. I tested negative. Here's what happened. AMA","subreddit":"IAmA","subredditId":"t5_2qzb6","thumbnail":"self","selftext":"This story is a followup to [I got diagnosed with HIV](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/addss/iam_20_and_just_got_diagnosed_with_hiv_ama/?sort=new). I just woke up after a night partying (as you could guess) and here is what happened, in details, along with bits of my frustration concerning the Canadian Health System.\n\nBasically, I have had a test for HIV and turned positive. My doctor read me the full documentation on \"living with HIV,\" including a quick meeting with a counselor, so I was 100% sure I had it. Today I went for another test and **it didn't went as planned. What happened is both funny (not that I think of it) and sad.**\n\nI arrived to my appointment late and felt I was very stupid. The waiting room was full of weird people. One of them kept opening and closing his mouth every second, it annoyed me so bad I had to look away. One looked like she was 16 tops and had a small kid she held by the hand. Nevermind, here came my turn.\n\nThe doctor already had my full file, including my other test results from a week earlier. The first thing he said was:\n\n-You test for syphilis?\n\n-I think.\n\n-The last person who had syphilis was a Haitian woman who came back from a long trip there. You don't have syphilis. Waste of time.\n\n-Well now I am sure.\n\n-Okay... Well I am sorry for your HIV test results. You know, things have changed for HIV-positive people. You have great treatment now. Sure, you got to watch your health a bit more but it's not the death sentence it used to be. You know, HIV-positive people even have kids these days.\n\n-Really?\n\n-Yes. I have some patients who are moutain-climbers, travellers, and more.\n\n-So I really do have HIV? (I knew it... I knew it...)\n\n-Possibly. Time for a test. Give me your hand.\n\nWanting to use my \"knowledge\" and wanting to look smart, I asked him if the test was the one I though about.\n\n-You are going to do Western Blot right?\n\n-No. \n\n-Oh? I thought it was the most used...\n\n-Sir, one second.\n\nI really thought he told me \"Just let me do my job\". He took my finger, took a bit of blood and dropped it in a vial. Then someone came to take the vial and the doctor started to look at my file. I wasn't sure at the time of what was happening.\n\nThen, I saw his expression change dramatically. He went from having a little smile to looking concerned. I knew it. I had HIV. It's okay, I was mentally prepared.\n\n-So?\n\n-Hmm?\n\n-What are the results?\n\n-I don't know, it ain't ready yet. \n\n-Oh.\n\nDamn me. Every second that passed looked like a hour. I didn't know what to do, even how to move. Then, after a long wait, someone opened the door.\n\n-So? I said. Is it ready?\n\nThe doctor took the file and looked at it. I noticed I had my fingers, even my toes crossed. Our ancestors did that to conjure bad spells. But how could I get HIV? I had no risky comportment. I slept with one girl... That girl cheated on me... Maybe.... Probably not? Man I was stupid. \"If I ever get tested HIV-negative I'm never EVER having unprotected sex again, I swear it,\" I told to myself. Then came the words:\n\n-Yes, said the doctor.\n\nI froze, and stood immobile on my chair for a moment. What? I should have known it. Science is accurate, tests work. I had HIV. My life was over. Time to cry.\n\n-What?\n\n-Yes, it's ready.\n\nOh my god... How could he play with my feelings like that? Acting like he answered my first questions.\n\n-So I have HIV?\n\n-We will do another test, he said.\n\nHeh, I knew it. The second test was positive. I KNEW IT. It was so obvious. He got out, came out with another apparel, a bit smaller, and another vial. He took another drop of blood and sent it. So I did have HIV. I saw a picture of myself dying of cancer, pneumonia... How, life is so unfair. How?\n\nTest results came back after a few minutes and this time I did not feel like asking any question. Then, he spoke:\n\n-No, he said, simply.\n\n-What?\n\n-No.\n\n-What happened?\n\n-You don't have HIV.\n\nI couldn't believe it. I thought it was a dream, or maybe he answered another question I had asked thirty minutes earlier just to test me. \"You don't have HIV\". It took me a minute to understand it.\n\n-But... how?\n\n-I had my big doubts concerning the first test. First, they tested you for a bunch of things at once. Hepatic, Syphilis, HIV... Second, you did mentioned a bad case of herpes a week earlier. \n\n-Yes... I said, barely able to form sentences.\n\n-Herpes is known to interfere with the test you had. Second, you only had a weak test, ELISA. To really confirm, you need a Western Blot. Third, you never had any risky comportment. All this made it sound very suspicious.\n\n-But didn't they do a Western Blot after the ELISA? This seems logic.\n\n-Apparently not. It took seven days to get the results. And you did get the test from a free clinic. Maybe they weren't able to perform a Western Blot and referred you to another clinic. Or, as I see on this sheer, your doctor only ordered an ELISA test. In short, they wanted you to come here to confirm.\n\n-But my doctor did a whole speech on living with HIV, even sent me to see a counselor.\n\n-Typical procedure. Better to be safe than sorry.\n\nHe explained that there were two cases of mistakes in HIV testing. 1-Getting negative results while you have HIV 2-Getting positive results when you don't have HIV. I was in the second category. He explained to me that, unless you use a more complete test, you can either reduce the odds of mistake 1, or mistake 2. Given the problems associated with number 1, they chose to reduce the odds of this problem, much like our justice system prefers to acquit guilty people and not convict innocents.\n\n-But why did you do two tests? I assumed the first was positive.\n\n-Both were negative. Given the false positive, I wanted to be sure before giving out the news.\n\n-The good news, I said. How can you be sure these two are right? The other was done after one week of testing, I said.\n\n-The odds of you having HIV is less than one in a million, he said. If that. Unless you got it in the three last months, of course.\n\n-Can we do a Western Blot to be sure?\n\n-No we can't.\n\n-Why?\n\n-Because it's useless. You don't have HIV. The test shows it, it's as simple as that. \n\n-How could I live all this... Because of one lab mistake?\n\n-Not a mistake. This test is very accurate. But it has its weaknesses.\n\nAfter much talk, I left, I thanked him again and was just too happy. I couldn't believe it. I went to eat at a nice restaurant and my family basically kidded me all night long with HIV. \"Don't touch me, you could give me HIV!\" \"Don't eat this, it's not approved for HIV-positive people\". I thought it was very funny until a bit later on when I went out to celebrate with friends.\n\n-This ain't funny, said one of my friends after a stupid joke of mine on AIDS.\n\n-Why?\n\n-Think of the people who don't have your luck. Think of the people who really have HIV. Think of what would have happened if the tests were positive this morning and how it would have changed your life. \n\n-You're right...\n\n-There are people who simply don't have your chance, he said. There are people, not much older than you, who now have positive diagnostic. There is nothing funny about that, and about HIV.\n\n-You're right, but what can I do about it?\n\n-After all this happened, and for this even, I think you should donate to an anti-HIV organisation. You ever donated before?\n\n-No, I said. Never.\n\n-Well it would be a great thing. You were lucky, but think of people who weren't.\n\nI spent a bit more time thinking about it, then eventually came to the conclusion he was right. This experience had changed me. Living nearly two days with that fear, and having it all resolved by science, was quite an experience. For this reason, I have chosen to donate $1,000 to the Canadian AIDS society. I know it's not much, and probably not even worth mentioning compared to the millions they get, but for me, a student who earned $6,000 last year working minimum wage, I do believe it's quite an accomplishment. I wasn't sure I could afford it, but my friend mentioned how much cash I could waste, even on this night ($200+) and he did convince me I could do it. I encourage any redditor concerned enough with the situation to donate to AIDS-fighting societies as well.\n\nSo this is it. The long story on how I was sure I had HIV, and how I finally discovered I had not. AMA\n\nEDIT: Edited for clarity, grammatical mistakes.\n\nEDIT2: Just to answer the thing about herpes... I have a pretty bad case of cold sores (herpes on the mouth). A bit before I had shingles, I had a very bad case of cold sore all over my top lip. I have had this since I was a kid. I do not know where I got it.

Reading it now, I see how badly worded it is. In a way, it's kind of both (if I've understood the explanations). Rather, it can be misunderstood (so, not necessarily purposely misleading), but HIV is being used in a way (not a [\"a normal/'wild type' HIV virus\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2vbfkl/are_they_really_using_hiv_to_treat_cancer_or_is/cog7z4d)). However, a better wording is [\"they used a highly modified retrovirus to deliver genetic material to T-cells\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2vbfkl/are_they_really_using_hiv_to_treat_cancer_or_is/cog85ev) and [\"No form of virus is injected into the patient at any time\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2vbfkl/are_they_really_using_hiv_to_treat_cancer_or_is/cogf0fp). \n\nSee comment section for more detail.\n/EDIT2\n\nThere are all types of sites that seem to say that HIV is used to cure cancer (such as [this site](http://www.medicaldaily.com/hiv-helped-utah-man-battle-cancer-how-disabled-hiv-turns-t-cells-serial-killers-310344)) and then there is [Cancer Research UK (article: *No, doctors did not “inject HIV into a dying girl�? to treat her cancer*)](http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2013/06/25/no-doctors-did-not-inject-hiv-into-a-dying-girl-to-treat-her-cancer/) which seems reliable, but I would like the opinion of experts as maybe this is just one case, and they actually are using HIV to treat even though that might seem off to me. Is HIV being used or is that misleading?\n\nAlso from the same site, [an article about how it's not exactly measles that is being used to help cure cancer](http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2014/05/16/could-measles-cure-cancer-uh-not-exactly/) which points out how it's not really measles or the vaccine that is being used. Assuming the site is a good site to get information, this seems like a common problem with the general public. Do any professionals have to deal with this or realize how much misinformation there is out there? What ways is there to counter mainstream media misinformation (this might be a question for another forum though)?\n\nI bring this up, because I am currently going back and forth with a user about this and want to make sure that I'm not backing incorrect information.\n\nThank you.\n\nEDIT1: This post was started due to a comment by /r/stoned_shaman which I didn't submit with the post, because I thought it wouldn't really be relevant. However, in some discussions it has become relevant, so I'm posting it here:\n\n&gt; Nope, human immunodeficiency virus actually. They're using viruses like HIV to kill cancer cells and there's good results from this! So if cancer is going to fuck you just get the oul HIV to kill it. The down side is you have HIV, but thats manageable and hey, your alive!\n\n\nI should point out that I don't think /r/stoned_shaman actually believes this anymore as they were following this thread. However, I want to point out what the perception is for some people when they read of this type of treatment. I don't exactly know what I thought before this point, but I think it was close to the same (the virus in full, but disabled somehow... I didn't really think about it), but when it was spelled out the way it was put (the treated person actually gets HIV) something didn't seem right, so I looked it up. Then I posted this thread. /EDIT1","selftextHTML":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDIT2: I&amp;#39;d like to apologize for the wording of the question.

Is HIV being used or is that misleading?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also from the same site, &lt;a href=\"http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2014/05/16/could-measles-cure-cancer-uh-not-exactly/\"&gt;an article about how it&amp;#39;s not exactly measles that is being used to help cure cancer&lt;/a&gt; which points out how it&amp;#39;s not really measles or the vaccine that is being used. Assuming the site is a good site to get information, this seems like a common problem with the general public. Do any professionals have to deal with this or realize how much misinformation there is out there? What ways is there to counter mainstream media misinformation (this might be a question for another forum though)?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bring this up, because I am currently going back and forth with a user about this and want to make sure that I&amp;#39;m not backing incorrect information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT1: This post was started due to a comment by &lt;a href=\"/r/stoned_shaman\"&gt;/r/stoned_shaman&lt;/a&gt; which I didn&amp;#39;t submit with the post, because I thought it wouldn&amp;#39;t really be relevant. However, in some discussions it has become relevant, so I&amp;#39;m posting it here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nope, human immunodeficiency virus actually. They&amp;#39;re using viruses like HIV to kill cancer cells and there&amp;#39;s good results from this! So if cancer is going to fuck you just get the oul HIV to kill it. The down side is you have HIV, but thats manageable and hey, your alive!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should point out that I don&amp;#39;t think &lt;a href=\"/r/stoned_shaman\"&gt;/r/stoned_shaman&lt;/a&gt; actually believes this anymore as they were following this thread. However, I want to point out what the perception is for some people when they read of this type of treatment. I don&amp;#39;t exactly know what I thought before this point, but I think it was close to the same (the virus in full, but disabled somehow... I didn&amp;#39;t really think about it), but when it was spelled out the way it was put (the treated person actually gets HIV) something didn&amp;#39;t seem right, so I looked it up. Then I posted this thread. /EDIT1&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","domain":"self.askscience","gilded":0,"commentCount":44,"score":376,"upVotes":376,"downVotes":0,"created":1423531199,"createdUTC":1423502399,"visited":false,"self":false,"saved":false,"edited":false,"stickied":false,"nsfw":false,"hidden":false,"clicked":false,"users":["craniumonempty","bickus","craniumonempty","hougaiidesu","90mp11","craniumonempty","bickus","yerba-matee","agbortol","bickus","tangychicken","craniumonempty","polychaos","craniumonempty","polychaos","andersonmatt1125","craniumonempty","elerner","leopardbernstein","craniumonempty","me2s3m","craniumonempty","reythered","craniumonempty","reythered"],"kind":"t3","identifier":"2vbfkl","fullName":"t3_2vbfkl"},{"user":{"username":"hellovn100","modhash":"q7ddpx6xgx3b657640233226f11f5f1eb77a74dc3d51009c95","cookie":"43916988,2015-11-22T13:25:05,84dffe776ac6f099b709b9733030c6edc142d71b","password":"111111"},"wikis":["t cells","cancer"],"url":"http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-07-crispr-advance-scientists-successfully-human.html#","commentContent":"","permalink":"/r/Futurology/comments/3et8zd/in_crispr_advance_scientists_successfully_edit/?ref=search_posts","author":"Rodman930","title":"In CRISPR advance, scientists successfully edit human T cells to resist HIV and to fight cancer","subreddit":"Futurology","subredditId":"t5_2t7no","thumbnail":"http://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/O5bHBr1U0KjshiFVKHe97fqNlSoxEtmm-7SVZjvGOe8.jpg","selftext":"","domain":"medicalxpress.com","gilded":0,"commentCount":109,"score":1347,"upVotes":1347,"downVotes":0,"created":1438056575,"createdUTC":1438027775,"visited":false,"self":false,"saved":false,"edited":false,"stickied":false,"nsfw":false,"hidden":false,"clicked":false,"users":["rodman930","texhnogenebits","ferengiprophet","herman999999999","seriousaccount0","cannibaloxfords","didntgetyourjoke","cannibaloxfords","_chesthair_","northshore12","cannibaloxfords","fallcious","hahahahahaga","guywithlag","da_banhammer","fittitthroway","redblud","tjeffer886-stt","redblud","valmond","redblud","valmond","fittitthroway","redblud","furyfairy","theyear2045","chemicalcloud","cersad","chemicalcloud","mypenisisawmd","forcrowsafeast","cersad","_chesthair_","babboa","chemicalcloud","ryndo","mysterions","buck-nasty","valmond","wayback000","repan6517","wayback000","aceofspades25","c7hq","e_swartz","EurekasCashel","stile65","3dent","valmond","rotj83","zergaregmo","hateburn","Cersad","vakar","eryemil","farnlacher","rodman930","concretecake","K1ngN0thing","slicknog","infinitetimesink","e_swartz","infinitetimesink","ApostleThirteen","infinitetimesink","chispy","KingLeo23","c7hq","ilovemagicmush","lord_stryker","opisabundleofstix","mrturkle","apostlethirteen","edi-thor","stier69foru","wittyoriginalname","mcwizzle","skism462","tdmccall","cunnl01","nurgle_is_love","cersad","indiansurveydrone","gossumx","asdfasdfaefsdghgw","coderedmonkey","bewarr123","relkin43","protectpoultry","atlasfailed","itgetsreddit","luzianah","_drpepper_","teamteague"],"kind":"t3","identifier":"3et8zd","fullName":"t3_3et8zd"}],"sankeyNodes":[],"sentiments":["-0.57894737","-0.6216216","-0.46938777","-0.68235296","-0.3529412","-0.5","-0.5942029","-0.1764706","-0.75342464","-0.8095238","-0.64","-0.9310345","-0.55813956","-0.7196262","0.45454547","-0.72649574","-0.16438356","-0.14285715","-0.6603774","-0.11111111"],"keyword":"HIV & Cancer"}
