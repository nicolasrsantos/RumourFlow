And that\u0027s the right thing to do if everyone is tested, or if you were chosen randomly for testing.\n\nBut a lot of people who go for an HIV test (say) in the first place are going for a reason - because they have been potentially exposed, or fall into a risk category.  So the prior you should use is the fraction of people in that same risk category that have the disease, not just in the whole population.

Even if *x* is a minority low-income gay who frequents prostitutes and uses illicit IV drugs, an independent confirmatory test should still be used.\n\nOne must weigh (and I\u0027m sure we agree) *all* of the evidence before coming to a conclusion.  In the OP\u0027s case, he has a rare skin disease (which is hard to assess if we don\u0027t know the relative risk of getting that particular diseases with vs. without HIV, but I\u0027m guessing +20dB), no hard drug use (-1 or so dB), never touched blood (-1 or so dB), and has had only one sexual partner (0 dB).  So instead of around 3:1 against (for a random screening, given 99% spec\u0026amp;sens), I would say about 21:1 in favor.  Strong odds, but still about a 4.5% probability of a false positive.","duration":"","id":113,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_c0h4lpa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":112,"links":[110],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"joezuntz","label":"True, but the question one step more interesting here is what prior you should use on having the disease in the first place - your \"chance of having the disease before I took the test\".\n\nThe first answer you would think of (and the one given in your comment and the linked article) is to use the population infection rate as your prior.  And that\u0027s the right thing to do if everyone is tested, or if you were chosen randomly for testing.\n\nBut a lot of people who go for an HIV test (say) in the first place are going for a reason - because they have been potentially exposed, or fall into a risk category.  So the prior you should use is the fraction of people in that same risk category that have the disease, not just in the whole population.  The same applies for lots of tests - people are typically tested because they have some kind of symptom.  You should include that information when forming your Bayesian prior.","duration":"","id":112,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_c0h3xbu","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":110,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"mschmahl","label":"Even a test that is very accurate can yield false positives.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity\n\nFor example, say your initial test has specificity and sensitivity both of 99%.  Which means that the test is correct 99% of the time.  This sounds high, but the prevalence of HIV in Canada is about 0.3%  Which means that it was still about three times as likely that you were the victim of a false positive than that you actually had HIV.

HIV raises a lot of fear and discrimination because people always think they can get it if the person touched the door knob without washing their hands, for example. There are many people around you with HIV and you probably don\u0027t care and live in fear that a drop of their saliva might infect you. But as soon as you learn someone has HIV, everything changes.

Glad to see an interested Redditor!\n\nI mostly feel sad for them, and depressed. I admire their courage on going through everything. I have been \"HIV positive\" for a week and already I thought of suicide a few times. I have seen most of my dreams crushed - travelling, having kids, having a good job, etc. \n\nFor the job, I can say discrimination against it... HIV raises a lot of fear and discrimination because people always think they can get it if the person touched the door knob without washing their hands, for example. There are many people around you with HIV and you probably don\u0027t care and live in fear that a drop of their saliva might infect you. But as soon as you learn someone has HIV, everything changes. That\u0027s how I see it. You feel at risk everything that person is near. This is a horrible feeling, this is how I see it. \n\nSome people definitely had a risky behavior but I don\u0027t believe it\u0027s a \"punishment\" and that overall anyone deserves it. Sorry for the long answer I hope it is clear. I consider people who have HIV like people who have cancer - unlucky, and generally unfairly discriminated upon.","duration":"","id":205,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_c0h42na","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":204,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"happybadger","label":"Follow up question to your last IAmA:\n\nI asked what you thought of people with HIV prior to your diagnosis and what you thought of them when you yourself might be included.

the HIV guy. I tested negative. Here\u0027s what happened. AMA","subreddit":"IAmA","subredditId":"t5_2qzb6","thumbnail":"self","selftext":"This story is a followup to [I got diagnosed with HIV](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/addss/iam_20_and_just_got_diagnosed_with_hiv_ama/?sort\u003dnew). I just woke up after a night partying (as you could guess) and here is what happened, in details, along with bits of my frustration concerning the Canadian Health System.\n\nBasically, I have had a test for HIV and turned positive. My doctor read me the full documentation on \"living with HIV,\" including a quick meeting with a counselor, so I was 100% sure I had it. Today I went for another test and **it didn\u0027t went as planned. What happened is both funny (not that I think of it) and sad.**\n\nI arrived to my appointment late and felt I was very stupid. The waiting room was full of weird people. One of them kept opening and closing his mouth every second, it annoyed me so bad I had to look away. One looked like she was 16 tops and had a small kid she held by the hand. Nevermind, here came my turn.\n\nThe doctor already had my full file, including my other test results from a week earlier. The first thing he said was:\n\n-You test for syphilis?\n\n-I think.\n\n-The last person who had syphilis was a Haitian woman who came back from a long trip there. You don\u0027t have syphilis. Waste of time.\n\n-Well now I am sure.\n\n-Okay... Well I am sorry for your HIV test results. You know, things have changed for HIV-positive people. You have great treatment now. Sure, you got to watch your health a bit more but it\u0027s not the death sentence it used to be. You know, HIV-positive people even have kids these days.\n\n-Really?\n\n-Yes. I have some patients who are moutain-climbers, travellers, and more.\n\n-So I really do have HIV? (I knew it... I knew it...)\n\n-Possibly. Time for a test. Give me your hand.\n\nWanting to use my \"knowledge\" and wanting to look smart, I asked him if the test was the one I though about.\n\n-You are going to do Western Blot right?\n\n-No. \n\n-Oh? I thought it was the most used...\n\n-Sir, one second.\n\nI really thought he told me \"Just let me do my job\". He took my finger, took a bit of blood and dropped it in a vial. Then someone came to take the vial and the doctor started to look at my file. I wasn\u0027t sure at the time of what was happening.\n\nThen, I saw his expression change dramatically. He went from having a little smile to looking concerned. I knew it. I had HIV. It\u0027s okay, I was mentally prepared.\n\n-So?\n\n-Hmm?\n\n-What are the results?\n\n-I don\u0027t know, it ain\u0027t ready yet. \n\n-Oh.\n\nDamn me. Every second that passed looked like a hour. I didn\u0027t know what to do, even how to move. Then, after a long wait, someone opened the door.\n\n-So? I said. Is it ready?\n\nThe doctor took the file and looked at it. I noticed I had my fingers, even my toes crossed. Our ancestors did that to conjure bad spells. But how could I get HIV? I had no risky comportment. I slept with one girl... That girl cheated on me... Maybe.... Probably not? Man I was stupid. \"If I ever get tested HIV-negative I\u0027m never EVER having unprotected sex again, I swear it,\" I told to myself. Then came the words:\n\n-Yes, said the doctor.\n\nI froze, and stood immobile on my chair for a moment. What? I should have known it. Science is accurate, tests work. I had HIV. My life was over. Time to cry.\n\n-What?\n\n-Yes, it\u0027s ready.\n\nOh my god... How could he play with my feelings like that? Acting like he answered my first questions.\n\n-So I have HIV?\n\n-We will do another test, he said.\n\nHeh, I knew it. The second test was positive. I KNEW IT. It was so obvious. He got out, came out with another apparel, a bit smaller, and another vial. He took another drop of blood and sent it. So I did have HIV. I saw a picture of myself dying of cancer, pneumonia... How, life is so unfair. How?\n\nTest results came back after a few minutes and this time I did not feel like asking any question. Then, he spoke:\n\n-No, he said, simply.\n\n-What?\n\n-No.\n\n-What happened?\n\n-You don\u0027t have HIV.\n\nI couldn\u0027t believe it. I thought it was a dream, or maybe he answered another question I had asked thirty minutes earlier just to test me. \"You don\u0027t have HIV\". It took me a minute to understand it.\n\n-But... how?\n\n-I had my big doubts concerning the first test. First, they tested you for a bunch of things at once. Hepatic, Syphilis, HIV... Second, you did mentioned a bad case of herpes a week earlier. \n\n-Yes... I said, barely able to form sentences.\n\n-Herpes is known to interfere with the test you had. Second, you only had a weak test, ELISA. To really confirm, you need a Western Blot. Third, you never had any risky comportment. All this made it sound very suspicious.\n\n-But didn\u0027t they do a Western Blot after the ELISA? This seems logic.\n\n-Apparently not. It took seven days to get the results. And you did get the test from a free clinic. Maybe they weren\u0027t able to perform a Western Blot and referred you to another clinic. Or, as I see on this sheer, your doctor only ordered an ELISA test. In short, they wanted you to come here to confirm.\n\n-But my doctor did a whole speech on living with HIV, even sent me to see a counselor.\n\n-Typical procedure. Better to be safe than sorry.\n\nHe explained that there were two cases of mistakes in HIV testing. 1-Getting negative results while you have HIV 2-Getting positive results when you don\u0027t have HIV. I was in the second category. He explained to me that, unless you use a more complete test, you can either reduce the odds of mistake 1, or mistake 2. Given the problems associated with number 1, they chose to reduce the odds of this problem, much like our justice system prefers to acquit guilty people and not convict innocents.\n\n-But why did you do two tests? I assumed the first was positive.\n\n-Both were negative. Given the false positive, I wanted to be sure before giving out the news.\n\n-The good news, I said. How can you be sure these two are right? The other was done after one week of testing, I said.\n\n-The odds of you having HIV is less than one in a million, he said. If that. Unless you got it in the three last months, of course.\n\n-Can we do a Western Blot to be sure?\n\n-No we can\u0027t.\n\n-Why?\n\n-Because it\u0027s useless. You don\u0027t have HIV. The test shows it, it\u0027s as simple as that. \n\n-How could I live all this... Because of one lab mistake?\n\n-Not a mistake. This test is very accurate. But it has its weaknesses.\n\nAfter much talk, I left, I thanked him again and was just too happy. I couldn\u0027t believe it. I went to eat at a nice restaurant and my family basically kidded me all night long with HIV. \"Don\u0027t touch me, you could give me HIV!\" \"Don\u0027t eat this, it\u0027s not approved for HIV-positive people\". I thought it was very funny until a bit later on when I went out to celebrate with friends.\n\n-This ain\u0027t funny, said one of my friends after a stupid joke of mine on AIDS.\n\n-Why?\n\n-Think of the people who don\u0027t have your luck. Think of the people who really have HIV. Think of what would have happened if the tests were positive this morning and how it would have changed your life. \n\n-You\u0027re right...\n\n-There are people who simply don\u0027t have your chance, he said. There are people, not much older than you, who now have positive diagnostic. There is nothing funny about that, and about HIV.\n\n-You\u0027re right, but what can I do about it?\n\n-After all this happened, and for this even, I think you should donate to an anti-HIV organisation. You ever donated before?\n\n-No, I said. Never.\n\n-Well it would be a great thing. You were lucky, but think of people who weren\u0027t.\n\nI spent a bit more time thinking about it, then eventually came to the conclusion he was right. This experience had changed me. Living nearly two days with that fear, and having it all resolved by science, was quite an experience. For this reason, I have chosen to donate $1,000 to the Canadian AIDS society. I know it\u0027s not much, and probably not even worth mentioning compared to the millions they get, but for me, a student who earned $6,000 last year working minimum wage, I do believe it\u0027s quite an accomplishment. I wasn\u0027t sure I could afford it, but my friend mentioned how much cash I could waste, even on this night ($200+) and he did convince me I could do it. I encourage any redditor concerned enough with the situation to donate to AIDS-fighting societies as well.\n\nSo this is it. The long story on how I was sure I had HIV, and how I finally discovered I had not. AMA\n\nEDIT: Edited for clarity, grammatical mistakes.\n\nEDIT2: Just to answer the thing about herpes... I have a pretty bad case of cold sores (herpes on the mouth). A bit before I had shingles, I had a very bad case of cold sore all over my top lip. I have had this since I was a kid.

I just woke up after a night partying (as you could guess) and here is what happened, in details, along with bits of my frustration concerning the Canadian Health System.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Basically, I have had a test for HIV and turned positive. My doctor read me the full documentation on \u0026amp;quot;living with HIV,\u0026amp;quot; including a quick meeting with a counselor, so I was 100% sure I had it. Today I went for another test and \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;it didn\u0026amp;#39;t went as planned. What happened is both funny (not that I think of it) and sad.\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I arrived to my appointment late and felt I was very stupid. The waiting room was full of weird people. One of them kept opening and closing his mouth every second, it annoyed me so bad I had to look away. One looked like she was 16 tops and had a small kid she held by the hand. Nevermind, here came my turn.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The doctor already had my full file, including my other test results from a week earlier. The first thing he said was:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;-You test for syphilis?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;-I think.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;-The last person who had syphilis was a Haitian woman who came back from a long trip there. You don\u0026amp;#39;t have syphilis. Waste of time.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;-Well now I am sure.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;-Okay... Well I am sorry for your HIV test results. You know, things have changed for HIV-positive people. You have great treatment now. Sure, you got to watch your health a bit more but it\u0026amp;#39;s not the death sentence it used to be. You know, HIV-positive people even have kids these days.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;-Really?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;-Yes. I have some patients who are moutain-climbers, travellers, and more.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;-So I really do have HIV? (I knew it... I knew it...)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;-Possibly. Time for a test. Give me your hand.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Wanting to use my \u0026amp;quot;knowledge\u0026amp;quot; and wanting to look smart, I asked him if the test was the one I though about.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;-You are going to do Western Blot right?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;-No. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;-Oh?

He took my finger, took a bit of blood and dropped it in a vial. Then someone came to take the vial and the doctor started to look at my file. I wasn\u0026amp;#39;t sure at the time of what was happening.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Then, I saw his expression change dramatically. He went from having a little smile to looking concerned. I knew it. I had HIV. It\u0026amp;#39;s okay, I was mentally prepared.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;-So?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;-Hmm?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;-What are the results?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;-I don\u0026amp;#39;t know, it ain\u0026amp;#39;t ready yet. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;-Oh.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Damn me. Every second that passed looked like a hour. I didn\u0026amp;#39;t know what to do, even how to move. Then, after a long wait, someone opened the door.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;-So? I said. Is it ready?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The doctor took the file and looked at it. I noticed I had my fingers, even my toes crossed.
