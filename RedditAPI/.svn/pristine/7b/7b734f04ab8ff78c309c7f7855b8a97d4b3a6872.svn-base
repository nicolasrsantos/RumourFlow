They had a methodology!\", let me just point out that what I am saying here is that the methodology just plain *sucks*. \r\n\r\nYou see, in order to be useful, a psychometric scale must have two traits: *validity* and *reliability*. \r\n\r\nA *valid* test is one that measures what it is supposed to measure, what it is used in the attempt to rate. An IQ test is valid to the extent that it measures intelligence. (And saying that it\u0027s \"only supposed to measure IQ\" is a feeble tautological cop-out.)\r\n\r\nA *reliable* test generates results that are consistent over time, and change only insofar as the underlying construct alters. An IQ test is reliable to the extent that the same person, taking it on two different days, will get the same score. \r\n\r\nNow, let us examine how these results were actually obtained:\r\n\r\n\"Assessment began by extracting personality\r\ndescriptions from several biographical sources for 39 presidents from\r\nWashington through Reagan. All identifying information was then removed to\r\nproduce anonymous biographical profiles. Several independent judges used these\r\nprofiles in conjunction with the Gough Adjective Check List (Gough \u0026amp; Heilbrun,\r\n1965) to rate the presidents on 300 descriptors, obtaining reliable assessments for\r\n110 adjectives (cf. Deluga, 1997, 1998; Historical Figures Assessment Collaborative,\r\n1977). These latter measures were then subjected to a factor analysis that\r\nobtained 14 distinct dimensions. One of these factors included such items as\r\n“intelligent,” “wise,” “inventive,” “interests wide,” “artistic,” “curious,” “sophisticated,”\r\n“complicated,” and “insightful” (but not “dull” or “commonplace”). Moreover,\r\na factor score defined by the linear composite of these items yielded\r\na measure having an internal-consistency reliability (coefficient alpha) of .90\r\n(Simonton, 1986c). The resulting factor was then interpreted as assessing the\r\nchief executives on Intellectual Brilliance.\"\r\n\r\nThe flaws in this methodology are so obvious as to make describing them an exercise in cruelty to the PI. Nevertheless, in the interests of thoroughness, I will give some basic guidelines to think about, and leave working out the details to the reader.\r\n\r\nConsider:  \r\n\r\nThe assessment method used filters through two layers of observer description. The \"blind\" nature of the second layer might help to remove bias, but what effect does it have to improve reliability?\r\n\r\nIn terms of reliability, can these tests be repeated? \r\n\r\nIn terms of validity, can these tests make testable (falsifiable) predictions?\r\n\r\nIn terms of both reliability and validity, what is the control group? \r\n\r\n","duration":"","id":3,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c1uvif","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Presidential IQ - Bush is *NOT* the dumbest.","label":"flemlord","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_1uujg","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.180618973E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.180632557E9,"simScore":0.7691509975550541,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":4,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"dln","label":"A bully personality always seems stupider to others than they might actually be.
