Misunderstandings happen.\r\n\r\nYeah, if you\u0027re looking for truth, you have to recognize bias where you see it. No arguments there.\r\n\r\nI don\u0027t call people sheep. I will say it jokingly sometimes. \"You\u0027re asleep in the matrix, man.\" But as a Christian, I can\u0027t judge people by a different standard than I use on myself. And in many ways, I\u0027m a sound sleeper also.\r\n\r\nRegarding your inquiry, I have to say \"as an engineering *major*\" because I\u0027m a computer programmer. I never worked as an engineer. So my answer\u0027s not going to be as interesting as you\u0027d hoped.\r\n\r\nWhen the towers came down I thought it was impossible because nothing really should have collapsed, just weakened. Buildings aren\u0027t made to withstand plane collisions (though now they may be), but they are made to withstand fire and heavy winds, even heavy oscillating winds. If you think of a single tower as a lever arm, the impact of a plane at the top is going to put a lot of very sudden force at the base. The same base that is made to support the weight of the entire structure.\r\n\r\nConcrete has severe compressive strength. But no tensile strength. Which is why they reinforce it with iron, or steel. Usually steel. The steel allows tensile strength to reinforced concrete. \r\n\r\nNow this is where my instincts kicked in. When you\u0027re rock climbing, you\u0027re using woven nylon. Let\u0027s say you weigh 200 lbs. Well, fuck, the woven nylon has a 2 ton rating. It\u0027s overkill. That nylon would support a small truck. What would it take to duplicate a truck\u0027s sudden impact on the nylon? Well, dropping the truck from the top of the rock. In all honesty, depending on the size of the truck, I don\u0027t think the woven nylon would snap. Though I could be wrong. I\u0027m actually not much of a climber anymore. But my point is that this overkill is very common in engineering.\r\n\r\nThe force required to do something is basically not a scenario. Let\u0027s assume the opposite to resume the discussion.\r\n\r\nThe tower then should have collapsed into the base. This is what I was expecting to see. What I saw was that it collapsed from the top down. There was some discussion about the heat of jet fuel, but this is (IMO) nonsense. Complete nonsense. That steel was forged and quenched at much higher temperatures. It\u0027s been a while since I was in school, but the softening of the girders made no sense to me. So you\u0027re saying that the fuel was aerated enough to burn but not to cool? Bollocks! Even if it were, it wouldn\u0027t soften naked girders.\r\n\r\nFinally, you have the collapse. Even if we assumed that I was in the wrong about the softening of the girders, the top of the building would collapse and fall off. They aren\u0027t dominoes. Each floor is made to withstand the weight of the floors above it. So am I to believe that the collapse created such dynamic weight that the other floors are going to collapse too?\r\n\r\nThe overkill in the calculations of materials and strengths are such that you can fill the floors in with concrete and be okay. This is why no one cares how many people are in the buildings, or what they put in the buildings themselves, because they don\u0027t need to. So even if the heat made the upper floors collapse, you\u0027d be left with 3/4 of a tower.\r\n\r\nThis overkill is why they build skyscrapers in the first place. If the calculations were \"close\", they wouldn\u0027t.\r\n\r\nMy source was American Dynasty by Kevin Phillips (I think that\u0027s his name). Regarding the Iranians.\r\n\r\nYou\u0027re having trouble with the 9/11 conspiracy, \"I\u0027m not going to talk to you about space weapons\" (wink), but if you ready further down, I end up talking about them anyway.

And in many ways, I\u0027m a sound sleeper also.\r\n\r\nRegarding your inquiry, I have to say \"as an engineering *major*\" because I\u0027m a computer programmer. I never worked as an engineer. So my answer\u0027s not going to be as interesting as you\u0027d hoped.\r\n\r\nWhen the towers came down I thought it was impossible because nothing really should have collapsed, just weakened. Buildings aren\u0027t made to withstand plane collisions (though now they may be), but they are made to withstand fire and heavy winds, even heavy oscillating winds. If you think of a single tower as a lever arm, the impact of a plane at the top is going to put a lot of very sudden force at the base. The same base that is made to support the weight of the entire structure.\r\n\r\nConcrete has severe compressive strength. But no tensile strength. Which is why they reinforce it with iron, or steel. Usually steel. The steel allows tensile strength to reinforced concrete. \r\n\r\nNow this is where my instincts kicked in. When you\u0027re rock climbing, you\u0027re using woven nylon. Let\u0027s say you weigh 200 lbs. Well, fuck, the woven nylon has a 2 ton rating. It\u0027s overkill. That nylon would support a small truck. What would it take to duplicate a truck\u0027s sudden impact on the nylon? Well, dropping the truck from the top of the rock. In all honesty, depending on the size of the truck, I don\u0027t think the woven nylon would snap. Though I could be wrong. I\u0027m actually not much of a climber anymore. But my point is that this overkill is very common in engineering.\r\n\r\nThe force required to do something is basically not a scenario. Let\u0027s assume the opposite to resume the discussion.\r\n\r\nThe tower then should have collapsed into the base. This is what I was expecting to see. What I saw was that it collapsed from the top down. There was some discussion about the heat of jet fuel, but this is (IMO) nonsense. Complete nonsense. That steel was forged and quenched at much higher temperatures. It\u0027s been a while since I was in school, but the softening of the girders made no sense to me. So you\u0027re saying that the fuel was aerated enough to burn but not to cool? Bollocks! Even if it were, it wouldn\u0027t soften naked girders.\r\n\r\nFinally, you have the collapse. Even if we assumed that I was in the wrong about the softening of the girders, the top of the building would collapse and fall off. They aren\u0027t dominoes. Each floor is made to withstand the weight of the floors above it. So am I to believe that the collapse created such dynamic weight that the other floors are going to collapse too?\r\n\r\nThe overkill in the calculations of materials and strengths are such that you can fill the floors in with concrete and be okay. This is why no one cares how many people are in the buildings, or what they put in the buildings themselves, because they don\u0027t need to. So even if the heat made the upper floors collapse, you\u0027d be left with 3/4 of a tower.\r\n\r\nThis overkill is why they build skyscrapers in the first place. If the calculations were \"close\", they wouldn\u0027t.\r\n\r\nMy source was American Dynasty by Kevin Phillips (I think that\u0027s his name). Regarding the Iranians.\r\n\r\nYou\u0027re having trouble with the 9/11 conspiracy, \"I\u0027m not going to talk to you about space weapons\" (wink), but if you ready further down, I end up talking about them anyway.

Buildings aren\u0027t made to withstand plane collisions (though now they may be), but they are made to withstand fire and heavy winds, even heavy oscillating winds.

The same base that is made to support the weight of the entire structure.\r\n\r\nConcrete has severe compressive strength. But no tensile strength. Which is why they reinforce it with iron, or steel. Usually steel. The steel allows tensile strength to reinforced concrete. \r\n\r\nNow this is where my instincts kicked in. When you\u0027re rock climbing, you\u0027re using woven nylon. Let\u0027s say you weigh 200 lbs. Well, fuck, the woven nylon has a 2 ton rating. It\u0027s overkill. That nylon would support a small truck. What would it take to duplicate a truck\u0027s sudden impact on the nylon? Well, dropping the truck from the top of the rock. In all honesty, depending on the size of the truck, I don\u0027t think the woven nylon would snap. Though I could be wrong. I\u0027m actually not much of a climber anymore.

Let\u0027s assume the opposite to resume the discussion.\r\n\r\nThe tower then should have collapsed into the base. This is what I was expecting to see. What I saw was that it collapsed from the top down. There was some discussion about the heat of jet fuel, but this is (IMO) nonsense. Complete nonsense. That steel was forged and quenched at much higher temperatures. It\u0027s been a while since I was in school, but the softening of the girders made no sense to me. So you\u0027re saying that the fuel was aerated enough to burn but not to cool? Bollocks! Even if it were, it wouldn\u0027t soften naked girders.\r\n\r\nFinally, you have the collapse. Even if we assumed that I was in the wrong about the softening of the girders, the top of the building would collapse and fall off. They aren\u0027t dominoes.

So am I to believe that the collapse created such dynamic weight that the other floors are going to collapse too?\r\n\r\nThe overkill in the calculations of materials and strengths are such that you can fill the floors in with concrete and be okay.

And that is we\u0027re not playing on the same team anymore.\r\n\r\nI remember when POW\u0027s was a \u0027conspiracy theory\u0027. The government said they didn\u0027t leave anyone in Vietnam unless they were MIA\u0027s, KIA\u0027s, etc.  I think in 2004 there were still 400 POW\u0027s, only they had integrated into Vietnam society. They settled down in Vietnam, unable apparently to forgive their country for having left them.\r\n\r\nI think that was the beginning of a splintering in America. You had people who wanted to be good, be ethical, here and abroad, and you had people who wanted whatever they wanted, damn it, and didn\u0027t want anyone thinking too much about it. Just action. War, in short. When you start breaking these important rules, such as never leave a man behind, it opens you up to anything, ethically. \r\n\r\nI find it really interesting that it\u0027s so terrestrial, the 9/11 thing. I mean, it\u0027s not \"Did we land on the moon?\" where it\u0027s harder to get evidence. It\u0027s New York, only a few miles away for many many people.\r\n\r\nThe one that I thought about the most, that came from this thread actually, was the person filming the first plane crash. Just think about this. New York, skyscrapers, low visibility. Someone is camcording or cell-phone recording a narrow window of the world trade center at 8:15 am.?\r\n\r\nWhat was he doing, filming his dog pooping and ... whoa! what\u0027s that in the background a plane hitting WTC One?\r\n\r\nThat makes me think that people knew about it. Well, it was *patently* a conspiracy anyway, based on the conspirator\u0027s plan, but the guy who filmed the first plane was expecting it, and this makes me think that a lot of other people knew and allowed it to happen.\r\n\r\nTrust is gone in the USA.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I tried to find the footage of the first plane, and I think my theory needs some work ;)","duration":"","id":67,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_c1fb9nq","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":66,"links":[62],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Darrelc","label":"Sorry for the late reply, been hectic recently and I haven\u0027t had chance to sit down and write a proper reply.\n\nI agree about the misunderstandings, unfortunately it\u0027s more often than not idiots - it\u0027s refreshing to see I was wrong about you.\n\nI thought you meant an actually in the engineer field but it\u0027s still awesome having a majors in engineering, respect for that.\n\n\u0026gt; When the towers came down I thought it was impossible because nothing really should have collapsed, just weakened. Buildings aren\u0027t made to withstand plane collisions (though now they may be), but they are made to withstand fire and heavy winds, even heavy oscillating winds. If you think of a single tower as a lever arm, the impact of a plane at the top is going to put a lot of very sudden force at the base. The same base that is made to support the weight of the entire structure.\n\n\u0026gt;Concrete has severe compressive strength. But no tensile strength. Which is why they reinforce it with iron, or steel. Usually steel. The steel allows tensile strength to reinforced concrete.\n\nNo disagreements here.\n\n\u0026gt; Now this is where my instincts kicked in. When you\u0027re rock climbing, you\u0027re using woven nylon. Let\u0027s say you weigh 200 lbs. Well, fuck, the woven nylon has a 2 ton rating. It\u0027s overkill. That nylon would support a small truck. What would it take to duplicate a truck\u0027s sudden impact on the nylon? Well, dropping the truck from the top of the rock. In all honesty, depending on the size of the truck, I don\u0027t think the woven nylon would snap. Though I could be wrong. I\u0027m actually not much of a climber anymore. But my point is that this overkill is very common in engineering.\n\nI agree about the overkill - it\u0027s always better to err on the site of caution, especially in construction and planning. What you\u0027re saying about replicating the impact by dropping shows good *(Fuck, can\u0027t think of the appropriate word - Workaround-ing?)* skills which I find is a great way of dealing with problems like what you described with dropping the truck. \n\nI suppose an apt scenario would be if the truck caught fire after being dropped. Say the nylon was coated with fireproofing material, *(I\u0027ve never been a climber, can you get fire-proof ropes?)* maybe it could hold for a length of time. The stress of the hanging truck (loosely relating to the structural damage from having a plane inside a building) in combination with the fire might be enough to make the rope snap.\n\nObviously claiming that proves the 9/11 situation would be silly, but I suppose it\u0027s a fairly close example as to how extreme circumstances can affect properties of things.\n\n\u0026gt; The force required to do something is basically not a scenario. Let\u0027s assume the opposite to resume the discussion.\n\nI love your thinking style. I really do.\n\n\u0026gt; The tower then should have collapsed into the base. This is what I was expecting to see. What I saw was that it collapsed from the top down. There was some discussion about the heat of jet fuel, but this is (IMO) nonsense. Complete nonsense. That steel was forged and quenched at much higher temperatures. It\u0027s been a while since I was in school, but the softening of the girders made no sense to me. So you\u0027re saying that the fuel was aerated enough to burn but not to cool? Bollocks! Even if it were, it wouldn\u0027t soften naked girders.\n\nQuite a good argument, I suppose it rests on the claim that steel loses x% of its structural integrity at x Degrees. Care to discuss this at all? (although prolly not best on a week old reddit thread heh) \n\n\u0026gt; Finally, you have the collapse. Even if we assumed that I was in the wrong about the softening of the girders, the top of the building would collapse and fall off. They aren\u0027t dominoes. Each floor is made to withstand the weight of the floors above it. So am I to believe that the collapse created such dynamic weight that the other floors are going to collapse too?\n\nThis comes back to a static vs. dynamic load I guess, or something along them lines. I think the hardest floor to go would be the first one that gave way, as it would\u0027ve had the least dynamic force of each of the collapses (assuming a consecutive collapse of Floor 80 onto 79, 80+79 onto 78 etc...).\n\nEach floor would have more dynamic load than the previous floor did - I think the difference in dynamic and static forces explains why even though each floor descending would\u0027ve been built to withstand more force than the one before.\n\n\nI\u0027ve burnt my head out (long day at work).

Clearly, no evidence is or can be incontrovertible, because anything can be denied. If I had one wish, people would understand that we see what we want to believe. I would say that over and over again. Science doesn\u0027t really change that, because people interpret the results anyway they want to. (Global warming, anyone?)\r\n\r\nSo I try to avoid discussions with people who believe that scientists are objective, or that science exists without scientists, as an abstract ideal.\r\n\r\nI would be interested in reading Purdue\u0027s study. Is [this](http://www.purdue.edu/uns/x/2007a/070612HoffmannWTC.html) what you\u0027re referring to?\r\n\r\nWell, I don\u0027t know about space weapons. It\u0027s something that you see referred to in the literature from time to time, but like a lot of other things, until it comes from official channels, it won\u0027t be believed. I first heard about it from Noam Chomsky, then I wrote an email to Thomas PM Bartnett ([his blog](http://globlogization.wikistrat.com/)), and he said, and I quote \"By and large, Chomsky is full of shit.\"\r\n\r\nHe worked for the Pentagon as a middle-ranking guy for a long time, and he (apparently) never heard of any space weapons. \r\n\r\nSo either 1) they exist and they\u0027re a well-kept secret or 2) they just don\u0027t exist.\r\n\r\nYou remember star wars (Reagan) and the Columbia disaster. Some think that the shuttle was carrying a missile payload that detonated. Like all conspiracy theories, it needs evidence. That Feynman was able to explain the disaster in terms of cold O-rings speaks to me more about possibilities and less about truth. (And I\u0027m sure it\u0027s going to be the same when I get around to reading that Purdue study.)\r\n\r\nSome say we never landed on the moon. But some others say that we did, but were chased off. By ET\u0027s. Some of this subset say that weapons in space are following a \"plan.\" 1) Russians 2) Dictators 3) Terrorists 4) ET\u0027s. Star Wars would have been step # 1, for instance.\r\n\r\nNow, anyone can plainly see that weapons in space would be ideal from a military perspective. Understanding the military-industrial complex (that it *needs* war to further itself), I am comfortable *assuming* that there are weapons in space.\r\n\r\nThis may sound strange to some, but remember that Eisenhower warned us of the complex in \u002754 (farewell speech to the union), and look at what\u0027s happened since then. A false flag (Gulf of Tonkin) got us into \u0027nam. Skirmishes here and there. [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003d22YnJxDFUQE) is part 1 of 12 about our activities in Panama, which clearly paves the way to a future type of war, involving PsyOps. It\u0027s worth your time. And it fills in a couple of \"blanks\" between Nam and Iraq. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, there\u0027s a part in that documentary about future weapons. Some Nicaraguans said that cars were melted, cut in half. I think there was a mention of a green laser, but I would have to go back and listen to it. It doesn\u0027t speak so much about space, but about the Military Industrial Complex\u0027s need for war to develop and prosper.\r\n\r\nSpace has obvious appeal. Deploy anywhere in the world in minutes. Afghanistan featured a high level of satellite technology in deployment. In October 2001. It worked like fucking gangbusters.\r\n\r\nSo there are a lot of evidence \u0027gaps\u0027 and holes when I say \"there are weapons in space\". Some NASA people have come forward and said that there are aliens, this and that, bases on the moon, UFO\u0027s, but until NASA itself says it, people aren\u0027t going to believe them. People see what they want to believe. I think if you\u0027re an astronaut, you\u0027re pretty damn credible. But never underestimate people\u0027s willingness to create illusions.\r\n\r\nNixon has some things about NASA classified until 2026. I think there are probably going to come to light some things before 2050 or 2060 that will make it clear that there were weapons in space for a while, even pointed at our allies from time to time (who our \"allies\" are changes with the wind). But all of this is based on putting things together from literature. It\u0027s a long process, and I don\u0027t mind being proven wrong, but like I said, I just know these guys. They think in terms of war. It\u0027s how they see the world.","duration":"","id":69,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_c1e9rgp","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":68,"links":[58],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"toploader","label":"I also have a degree in mechanical engineering and worked in the aerospace business for ~10 years.\n\nSaying that \"Neither of those towers should have collapsed\" is an assertion that has to be left to people who have actually studied the data.

I personally own the hard copy of this article and can confirm that it has been transcribed correctly. \n\nhttp://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/fiveisraelis.html\n\nThen you have one man in particular who was arrested that day. He had a moving company and warehouse in NJ that were left completely abandoned when he fled to Israel following his arrest. This man was linked to the Zoomcopter ring centered in New Jersey malls.

One camp decides they wish to believe the Commission and will accept remotely plausible explanations of what the other camp sees as a stonewalling investigation, glaring inconsistencies, coincidences too odd, physics manifesting itself in ways so rare and unusual that the explanations offered are contested by legions of highly qualified professionals, and a requisite confluence of events beyond the bounds of reasonable probability of coming together necessary to allow it to occur.\n\nThe former camp sees those same set of rare oddities and decides, with help from the government, that it all jibes, is all tied up in neat package, and tries to cast out disbelievers, not as healthy skeptics, but as tin foil hatted lunatics trying to tear down the government. The latter group looks at those same oddities and says, \"I smell a rat. Let\u0027s keep looking at this\". I would think the casual observer would agree the latter group has the more forthright agenda.\n\nAs I\u0027ve said few other times,  I don\u0027t believe the government, as we know to be, was responsible.

I don\u0027t believe that \"9/11 was an inside job\". However, that is only one view on a fairly broad spectrum of views about how events unfolded on that day.  The easiest way to show the points on that spectrum are the acronyms that used to be used in the truth community. \"LIHOP\", \"MIHOP\".  \"Let it happen on purpose\", \"Make it happen on purpose\". There\u0027s a vast number of \"theories\" associated with both extremes, but the more you look into the evidence reasonably and rationally, a \"LIHOP\" theory becomes more and more likely - not involving the entire government, but rather a very small handful of people (probably five or less) who were in a position of sufficient power (and significant benefit from the attacks) to create the conditions where normal procedures that would have stopped such an attack became ineffective. \n\nThese include curiosities like the fact that in the months before 9/11 Cheney (or it might have been Rumsfeld, I honestly forget) changed the longstanding policy that fighter squadrons automatically had the authority to shoot down passenger planes that had been hijacked. The policy was changed so that the order had to be directly given by him - something which in a crisis situation would take precious dozens of minutes.  Interestingly the policy change was reversed not long after 9/11.\n\nThe still mysterious and inexplicable absence of the President, or indeed any transcripts of what the President was doing during the attacks, despite the fact that all the transcripts show that Dick Cheney appeared to be acting as Commander in Chief throughout the entire debacle. \n\nThe fact that the head of the Pakistani Intelligence Services or ISI was in Washington during the attacks, and just days earlier had been wired a large sum of money by the US authorities. \n\nThe confirmed presence of Israeli \"Students\" monitoring the attacks from a rooftop, and cheering as the planes hit the towers. This is not, as has been suggested, a hoax, if you search for them on Youtube, they were actually interviewed on Israeli TV about the event. \n\nThe speed with which the \"PATRIOT\" Act was introduced into the house and congress (the document was over 1500 pages long, and had clearly been sitting on a shelf waiting for just such an event) - the fact that Senators who demanded time to actually READ the bill were sent Anthrax in the mail (a strain that originated from a US Biowarfare lab).\n\nNow.. Notice I haven\u0027t said _anything_ about \"no planes\", or \"a missile\", or \"controlled demolition\", or any of the normal wackiness associated with nutcase conspiracy theories. The fact is those elements, the physical evidence, are a distraction. One doesn\u0027t have to focus on those to find a clear paper trail that leads to the fact that there were most *definitely* people who were aware that this event was going to take place - to what extent they knew, we\u0027ll never know, but the second takeaway is that there are clearly groups and interests who not only benefited, but profited massively on the back of the attacks. \n\nRead the story of [Sibel Edmonds](http://justacitizen.net/), as a very good starting point for a highly credible witness that will begin to take you down the rabbit hole. Among many other things, she found evidence that the FBI had been infiltrated by Turkish Intelligence, and not so indirectly implies that this is one of the major reasons why 9/11 was able to happen. Mind you, for being a whistleblower she basically had her life destroyed by the FBI, who tried desperately to stop her.\n\nAnd finally. The planes were hijacked by 19 SAUDIS. The US invades AFGHANISTAN. Sorry. Doesn\u0027t add up.

Instead I will show a string of events and whatnot that will make you think that at the very least something is amiss, and let you choose yourself.  Some stuff minor, some stuff major.\n\n1. Mayor Willie Brown receiving the warning call 8 hours before 9/11: http://propagandamatrix.com/willie_brown_got_low_key_early_warning.html\nHe later on said that the paper was wrong, they spreaded lies, ect.  Which is possible, it is after all a relatively large paper, and like most other mainstream media, spreading lies isn\u0027t that much of stretch.  However, for them to have said such a big lie like that and not get investigated which the country was so sensitive on this stuff, it doesn\u0027t make sense to me.  I\u0027m sure the FBI would be all over it if they heard a random person received warning 8 hours prior to 9/11.  For the paper to not even be touched on this issue, first off if what they said is true that doesn\u0027t make sense to me that it would go ignored, and second off if what they said is false it makes no sense to me that there was no reprimands for doing something as horrible as using 9/11 to spread lies like that.  Assuming it was a conspiracy, it wouldn\u0027t be too much of a stretch of the imagination to think he would be threatened or coerced himself after the article to stfu about it.  But that\u0027s just speculation.\n\n2. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dpPRQNCkdJxA  FEMA was for some reason at NYC a single day before 9/11, ready to take action.  No, this doesn\u0027t mean every single member of FEMA would be in on it, as most lower level people they\u0027d just be following orders.  They get told its some training exercise, they\u0027re gone.  Hell, considering the attitudes of people I\u0027ve worked with in the past, I personally can see them simply being told \"Go here.\" and not thinking it suspicious at all.  I find FEMA being there to be a big coincidence by itself, let alone with everything else.\n\n3. the famous NORAD war games.  Another very huge coincidence for me.  What worse day could they have chosen?  The overlapping war games and real life caused much confusion.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003def8IY3zKEcc\u0026amp;feature\u003drelated listening to that news piece, you can tell there was a lot of chaos and madness with them that day.  For them to be running a drill so similar to what was actually going on that day, it cannot be overlooked.  Yes, they had another reason for doing the war games listed, but that\u0027s not really surprising, of course they\u0027re going to give a reason for holding these war games, they\u0027re not just going to call it \"Training drills done to distract us from actual terrorist attacks.\"  So anyone pointing out that the war game\u0027s original purpose was something else is just bringing up a very bad argument.\n\n4. Larry Silverstein\u0027s famous \"pull it\" comment.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003d7WYdAJQV100  By itself, fine, you can make the case that he WASN\u0027T talking about exploding the building, he was talking about pulling the people out of there.  I have a very hard time swallowing that one, because pull it is a general demolition term, and that is a very odd way of saying \"Get those people out of there.\"  The overlap is worth noting.  To add to that, though, as it was accidentally exposed by fox news on a 9/11 conspiracy hit piece ( http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2010/04/22/jeffrey-scott-shapiro-jesse-venture-book-lies-truthers-ground-zero-sept-shame/ ), they said this revealing bit:\n\"Shortly before the building collapsed, several NYPD officers and Con-Edison workers told me that Larry Silverstein, the property developer of One World Financial Center was on the phone with his insurance carrier to see if they would authorize the controlled demolition of the building – since its foundation was already unstable and expected to fall.\"\nAs it\u0027s been pointed so many times by the opponents of a conspiracy, it takes WEEKS to set up a controlled demolition.  If he thought the building was unstable and ready to fall, why would he want to risk workers going in and out of the building for a few weeks to set up the explosions?  This for me reveals a lot.  On a side note, there was that whole him putting an insurance policy on the buildings bit.\n\n4. The even more famous Norman Mineta.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dbDfdOwt2v3Y  First I\u0027m actually going to argue the other side.  The order may still stand, but he at no point said which order it is.  It could be as likely the order was to shoot it down as it is to stand down.  It could go either way, to be weary of this one.  In fact, listening to the full interview, the order is more likely for \"shoot them down\" than \"stand down.\"  Does this argue against a conspiracy?  Yes.  I don\u0027t like it when it gets brought up to argue for a conspiracy theory.  However: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003du-5PKQTUz5o\u0026amp;feature\u003drelated  Why did the 9/11 commission omit various parts of his testimony?  And why does it go so much against what Norman Mineta is saying?  While on this subject, another little tid bit is that there\u0027s a bit of a controversy over whether or not Cheney had direct control over NORAD based on something Bush signed into law May 8th of that year.  It didn\u0027t directly state he had Norad, but it could\u0027ve been interpreted that way.  According to Mr. Mineta, it sounds to me like at the very least, on this day, Cheney was calling the shots here.  But, again, for the other side, that can almost be considered a mute point if the order was to shoot the planes down instead of stand down.\n\n5. The 9/11 commission report.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dTzrv-e37Es8  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dqnANe7w8pmY\u0026amp;feature\u003drelated The Chairmans themselves thinks they were set up to fail.

In the same article, \"\"I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described,\" John Farmer, a former New Jersey attorney general who led the staff inquiry into events on Sept. 11, said in a recent interview. \"The tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years. . . . This is not spin. This is not true.\" \"\n\nWe have the 2 chairmen calling foul.  Commissioner Bob Kerrey says they couldn\u0027t do their job: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dgtJWBcWAeAw  Commissioner Tim Roemer: http://articles.cnn.com/2006-08-02/politics/9-11panel.pentagon_1_criminal-probe-pentagon-world-trade-center?_s\u003dPM:POLITICS  Max Clelend REALLY tore them apart on their bullshit: http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2003/11/21/cleland/index.html?pn\u003d1 I think I missed one as well.\n\nThis is  the one part which I will be stating my view bluntly and directly, without worrying about sides.  With all of that that was just said from the horses mouth, if you don\u0027t want to believe the govt was behind it fine, but if ANYONE actually believes the 9/11 commission report, they\u0027re stupid and brainwashed.  Period.  There\u0027s no nice way of putting it.  \"This is true!\"  \u0027Actually, we\u0027re the ones who wrote this, this whole thing is full of lies....\"  \"That can\u0027t be, because it\u0027s true!\"  Is what it basically comes down to.  i have no nice thoughts for people this stupid.\n\nIf you wish me to, I will post a part 2 listing even more, and possibly a conclusion.  Just for now I\u0027ve been at this for nearly 2 hours so I feel like stopping.  If you want me to continue, just say so.","duration":"","id":171,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c1ea5q6","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"OK /r/conspiracy, sell me on your belief that 9/11 was an inside job","label":"toploader","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_f8yzt","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.296022392E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.296089286E9,"simScore":0.8085029501347603,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},{"index":172,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"tamrix","label":"All you have said this entire thread is \"I want more scientific evidence\" and then when people reply with what they think is proof you just say \"that evidence isn\u0027t good enough for me to believe it, because i\u0027m a smart engineer\".\n\nYou never started this topic with any intention of being convinced of the 9/11 conspiracy, you have made this topic to claim to fame your scientific background and give yourself an ego boost by knowing how smart you perceive yourself to be.\n\nI think everyone here has done a pretty good job with their supporting evidence and to be honest you\u0027re failing at trying to prove how smart you are. \n\nAnyway the deal breaker for me was when G.W Bush said, \"They hate our freedoms..\".
