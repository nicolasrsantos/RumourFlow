Remember, we've had 1 Catholic President, 0 openly Atheist Presidents and 0 Mormon Presidents.   We have also never had an Atheist Supreme Court Justice.

This is nothing new.  It is just like when people hated the Italian immigrants instead of the Irish.
JFK was the only Catholic President, and that was pretty much scandalous at the time.  Many people questioned whether he would subvert the interests of America in favor of the interests of the Pope.
Yes - bigotry is nothing new.  Islam is just the latest in a long, illustrious line of targets.
Jefferson probably was as well, but they refused to talk about it.  In fact, people accused Lincoln of being an atheist during the election to try to sink him.
Was it a problem that JFK was a Catholic?

Was it a problem that Jefferson was a Deist?

JFK in particular was theoretically subject to the Pope - you didn't see him working to advance any kind of Roman Catholic agenda.  If Obama was a muslim, why would it matter, so long as he's working in America's best interests?
