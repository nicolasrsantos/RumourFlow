We can\u0027t just pick and choose what we find \"convenient.\"*\n* Social conservatism: *A woman\u0027s place is in the home, with her children.*\n* Supporting conservative political parties: *Counting the days to January 20, 2017!*\n\nObviously, these four definitions of conservatism correlate with one another, but on the other hand they don\u0027t imply each other. It\u0027s possible to be any one of the four without being the other 3 (although it can be difficult to square theological conservatism with social liberalism).\n\nBy the standards of their Western host countries, most Muslim immigrants are doctrinally, theologically, and socially conservative, but don\u0027t vote for conservative political parties. Turkish Muslims are (by the Muslim world\u0027s standards), doctrinally, theologically and socially moderate, but the plurality vote for the conservative AK Party. American Orthodox Jews are doctrinally and theologically conservative, but socially moderate and lean Democratic. British Jews are doctrinally, theologically and socially liberal, but a large majority voted for the Conservatives in the last election.\n\nI would guess that members of Muslim-themed subreddits are quite a bit more doctrinally/theologically/socially liberal than most Muslims in Western countries (and far more than Muslims in general). Maybe there might be some more supporters of conservative political parties because internet messageboards attract contrarians. Young, tech-savvy, English-speaking people are going to be a pretty liberal group, both religiously and politically.\n\nOn the other hand, members of Jewish-themed subreddits are probably going to be more doctrinally, theologically, socially *and* politically conservative than Jews as a whole. Since most Jews are secular, anyone who seeks out a place to discuss the practice of Judaism is going to be more doctrinally, theologically and (probably) socially conservative than the whole group, pretty much by default. And since the only political issue that\u0027s specifically *about* Jews is Israel, and it\u0027s usually conservative political parties that are more supportive of Israel, those who seek out Jewish-themed subreddits to discuss politics are going to be more likely to support conservative political parties. But as a whole they\u0027re still a pretty \"liberal\" group in all four senses.","duration":"","id":11,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cv53zjk","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":10,"links":[9],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"QuelqueChoseRose","label":"Well basically all religious subreddits skew conservative theologically.

It\u0027s possible to be any one of the four without being the other 3 (although it can be difficult to square theological conservatism with social liberalism).\n\nBy the standards of their Western host countries, most Muslim immigrants are doctrinally, theologically, and socially conservative, but don\u0027t vote for conservative political parties. Turkish Muslims are (by the Muslim world\u0027s standards), doctrinally, theologically and socially moderate, but the plurality vote for the conservative AK Party. American Orthodox Jews are doctrinally and theologically conservative, but socially moderate and lean Democratic. British Jews are doctrinally, theologically and socially liberal, but a large majority voted for the Conservatives in the last election.\n\nI would guess that members of Muslim-themed subreddits are quite a bit more doctrinally/theologically/socially liberal than most Muslims in Western countries (and far more than Muslims in general). Maybe there might be some more supporters of conservative political parties because internet messageboards attract contrarians. Young, tech-savvy, English-speaking people are going to be a pretty liberal group, both religiously and politically.\n\nOn the other hand, members of Jewish-themed subreddits are probably going to be more doctrinally, theologically, socially *and* politically conservative than Jews as a whole. Since most Jews are secular, anyone who seeks out a place to discuss the practice of Judaism is going to be more doctrinally, theologically and (probably) socially conservative than the whole group, pretty much by default. And since the only political issue that\u0027s specifically *about* Jews is Israel, and it\u0027s usually conservative political parties that are more supportive of Israel, those who seek out Jewish-themed subreddits to discuss politics are going to be more likely to support conservative political parties.
