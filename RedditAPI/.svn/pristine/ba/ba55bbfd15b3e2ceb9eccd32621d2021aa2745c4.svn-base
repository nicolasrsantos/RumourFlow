But I was made to understand that such religious samplings required no sustained commitment on my part.

Atheist.\n\nHis [mother](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/obama/chi-0703270151mar27-archive,0,2623808.story)?

Both vocal atheists (talks about this a lot in his books)\n\n\nSimply put: Black people aren\u0027t getting elected if they\u0027re not religious.\n\nVisit [**/r/BlackAtheism**](/r/BlackAtheism) more and we discuss this in detail.\n\nQuotes like this and that [speech from 2006](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dQvKX16Eygs0) he did where he espouses his problems with referring to the bible show me that hes a closet atheist/very agnostic person that is playing the game of political musical chairs.\n\nDon\u0027t forget this: http://i.imgur.com/BVt0i.jpg\n\n\nHe \"found\" god @ 26 as a community organizer in Chicago and if you know chicago, theres a lot of black people there and you\u0027re not going to get famous there, as black man, without the black vote which comes from black churches. He had to play the game.\n\nGrew up in extremely diverse settings, i\u0027m sure having memories of madrasas allowed him to contrast that with the radical christianity in america....\n\nHes one of the smartest presidents, *on paper*, that we\u0027ve ever had. Remember, they tried to make fun of him because he went to the best schools in the country? I mean come on as if being a biracial kid raised by a single mother (even though she used to work for the Ford Foundation...LOL) isn\u0027t a massive hurdle in life.\n\nEvery chance he gets hes always promoting STEM fields and human achievement. Not willy nilly passive goals. \n\nHe rarely says that prayer influences his decisions a-la Bush 1 or 2, or even the possibly closet atheist that clinton was said to be. Faith is never a member of his team of decision makers.\n\nWhen he forgets to pray people blow their lids off and call him unamerican. He left god out of the verbatim recitation of various historical [documents](http://theydontfoolme.com/118/three-years-in-a-row-obama-fails-to-thank-god-at-thanksgiving/) and [speeches](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/25/obama-god-thanksgiving-speech_n_1113295.html) and [9/11](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/09/11/fox-omits-the-facts-to-politicize-9-11/189827)\n\nHes not religious **At all.**\n\nEvery time he opens his mouth about christianity it sounds [forced as hell](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/21/obama-religious-quotes_n_1292116.html).\nI\u0027m not going to go into his politics or anything...but I think to call him a closet atheist, is not a far stretch at all. I know /r/atheism loves the \"wheres the evidence\" claim, but to be honest here. [Obama has had more secular groups at the white house than any other president](http://content.usatoday.com/communities/Religion/post/2010/02/atheists-meet-with-white-house-officials/1) , a point verified by many fundie-right wingers; so i\u0027m sure they\u0027d be honest about feeling threatened. He only refers to religion during times of [tragedy](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/02/obama-on-faith-praying-for-egypt-gabby-giffordsand-for-patience-as-malia-goes-to-her-first-dance-wit/), mandatory events like [prayer breakfasts](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/obama-hosts-easter-prayer-breakfast-with-meditation-on-suffering/2012/04/04/gIQAhW7lvS_story.html)...or when hes [trolling the GOP like he recently basically said \"this is what jesus would do,\"](http://money.cnn.com/2012/02/02/news/economy/obama_tax_rich_jesus/index.htm) to try and convince them to adopt his politics.\n\nHe trolls religion regularly. Its obvious. Why else do you think all the fundies are scared they would lose their privileges under him? [He even campaigned on eliminating faith-based initiatives](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/05/obama.faith.based/) but after the backlash following his election he was forced to backtrack and reinforce the initiative with a \"faith office\". On top of that, don\u0027t forget him trying to get catholics to pay for birth control...  [hes trolling catholic church hospitals these days](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/17/health/policy/obama-administration-says-birth-control-mandate-applies-to-religious-groups-that-insure-themselves.html). I\u0027m certain that even slightly religious people would have more \"respect\" for people of faith and their autonomy. \n\nObama has supported gay-rights [WHOLEHEARTEDLY](http://realclearpolitics.blogs.time.com/2007/12/11/the_obama_questionnaire/\n) since 1996 AT LEAST\n\nNo one in politics or academia believes him; Even people with different views don\u0027t believe him:\n\n[Chris Hitchens](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dITsYUjv_aEA), [Richard Dawkins](http://www.theblaze.com/stories/richard-dawkins-barack-obama-probably-is-an-atheist-lincoln-kennedy-clinton-too/), [Ann Coulter](http://www.mediaite.com/tv/ann-coulter-on-the-other-obama-rumor-hes-not-muslim-hes-an-atheist/), [Lawrence Krauss](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dF-Lk7gHEfK4), [Pat Buchanan](http://townhall.com/columnists/patbuchanan/2012/02/21/creators_oped/page/full/), [Franklin Graham](http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/02/21/franklin-graham-questions-obama-romney-on-christian-faith/), [Pat Roberson](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/robertson-warns-of-looming-secular-atheist-dictatorship), [Bill Maher](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/01/13/bill_mahers_campaign_prediction_obama_will_come_out_as_an_atheist.html), [Penn Jillette](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dkJGxVeQw3SE\u0026amp;amp;feature\u003dplayer_embedded) etc. All of them think hes faking it. Hardcore christians and hardcore atheists.\n\nHe also campaigned on getting religion out of hiring practices: http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20082217-503544.html\n\nHe\u0027s the first president to acknowledge non-believers: http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-01-20-obama-non-believers_N.htm\n \nNow you want info on Jeremiah Wright? Obama probably only distantly knew the guy. He had to more than likely only show up for appearances to make him seem like he was in touch with the community. \n\nHere is a point we need to talk about... Jeremiah Wright was caught saying \"god damn america\"...[but you really don\u0027t understand what he was getting at.](http://www.timwise.org/2008/03/of-national-lies-and-racial-amnesia-jeremiah-wright-barack-obama-and-the-audacity-of-truth/) He was saying how utterly fucked up this country has been to minorities. Its true. You can deny it all you want, but he was highlighting a truth, albeit emotionally. He just wanted to say that America should really recognize their ways if they want to embrace Obama. Its kinda that \"hey, they don\u0027t like me? well damn them!\" Jeremiah Wright is not racist. Not at all. But you have to remember the bias white/right-wing america feels to anyone who talks about [white priviledge](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid\u003d3812249801848706206) or exposes their messed up of institutionalized racism, so of course the clip was crazy. [Obama had to throw him under the bus to move on](http://articles.cnn.com/2008-03-18/politics/obama.transcript_1_perfect-union-constitution-slavery?_s\u003dPM:POLITICS).\n\nBlack churches are the greatest source of networking in most urban communities, especially if black leaders are known to attend. Its all a game. I know in ~~Atlanta~~ every major city with a sizable minority population that many times, elected black officials only show up to church in times of election or when they need community support. They adopt a church home only to show their relation to the community. Its all for show. They have to connect with the people some how. Thats what a \"representative\" (in his case Senator) does.\n\n\nName a president who says this in his inaugural speech: \n\n   \u0026amp;gt; *\"We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus, and* ***nonbelievers.*** *We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth.\"*\n\nHe\u0027s already the negro, kenyan, socialist, communist, anti christ, who hates America.\n\n\nWhy throw people another bone to hate him for?\n\nFew links outlining many inconsistencies in his \"faith\":\n\n1. http://thekingsmanpaper.com/2012/03/the-atheist-in-chief/\n\n2. http://jewishatheist.blogspot.com/2007/10/obama-and-religion.html\n\n3. http://johntreed.com/Obamaatheist.html\n\nHere he is making fun clinging to guns and religion: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dDTxXUufI3jA\n\n\nThere is even a new biography that tackles his introduction to christianity and it sounds...[forced at best](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2018326327_apusobamabook.html): \n\n**And to cap it off, here is a section from \"The Audacity of Hope\".
