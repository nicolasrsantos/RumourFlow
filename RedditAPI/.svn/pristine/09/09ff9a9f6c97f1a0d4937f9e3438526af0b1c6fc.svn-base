Likely though the unsuccessful (or successful) attempts of terrorist attacks throughout the world by those who practice the Islamic faith, the media just changed its vernacular and decided that being Muslim was just as good as being a terrorist. And, let\u0027s be honest, American television - be it infotainment, entertainment, legitimate journalism, or otherwise - is often more *entertainment* than anything else. Thus, we have mass hysteria, and Glenn Beck, and Sarah Palin being actual sources of misinformed information for some Americans. \n\nI also think that many people (especially those who are ill-informed, uneducated, or just plain bigots) hear/see a *name* and believe it is of terrorist, or, FSM forbid, Muslim origin.
