Officially the system allows the Australian Defence Force to observe all air and sea activity north of Australia to distances of 3000 km. This encompasses all of Java, Irian Jaya, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, and halfway across the Indian Ocean. Other sources put the range at 4000 km from the Australian coastline,[23] as far away as Singapore.[24]\n\nThe JORN is so sensitive it is able to track planes as small as a Cessna 172 taking off and landing in East Timor 2600 km away. Current research is anticipated to increase its sensitivity by a factor of ten beyond this level. It is also reportedly able to detect stealth aircraft, as typically these are designed only to avoid detection by microwave radar.[6] Project DUNDEE[25] was a cooperative research project, with American missile defence research, into using JORN to detect missiles.[26] The JORN is anticipated to play a role in future Missile Defense Agency initiatives, detecting and tracking missile launches in Asia.[27]\"\nhttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jindalee_Operational_Radar_Network\n#MH370\nChris Shaker\n","duration":"","id":23,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cgnue0k","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4,"level":5,"title":"Monster list of all MH370 loose ends","label":"mh_mystery_throwaway","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_224uvo","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1396586856,"simScore":0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1397047435,"simScore":0.8584697425077719,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":24,"links":[0],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"connaissance1","label":"[What do you have to say to this theory, the 3rd and the 5th ones!](http://www.jimstonefreelance.com/top5theories370.html)","duration":"","id":24,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cgnvr4f","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4,"level":5,"title":"Monster list of all MH370 loose ends","label":"mh_mystery_throwaway","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_224uvo","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1396586856,"simScore":0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1397051844,"simScore":0.7928285705191749,"sentiment":"  Positive"},{"index":25,"links":[0],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"nesse","label":"How much fuel did the plane actually carry?

Now the plane is undetectable the pilot is free to go to his true destination, a lesser known airstrip barely maintained since ww2.  Not the easiest place to land a jet, and more importantly, not the first place you'd look for a missing jet.

First, it would need a considerable runway to accommodate it and, second, it would have had to overfly a hefty chunk of land and somebody would most likely have seen something.\n\n&gt;It seems much more likely, unfortunately, that it has gone down somewhere and the fact that nothing at all of it has been found strongly indicates that the search is not being conducted in the right area.\n\n&gt;That brings back round the loop to the failure of parties to share what they know of its whereabouts from various military and government services who track even the smallest of aircraft flying in airspace around their nations' borders.\n\n&gt;But there is pretty much no other logical conclusion that they are looking in the wrong places.\n\n[Source](http://www.pprune.org/rumours-news/535538-malaysian-airlines-mh370-contact-lost-71.html#post8364561)","duration":"","id":122,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cfzv280","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4,"level":5,"title":"So the missing Malaysian Airlines MH370 flight is getting stranger every day, Passengers cell phone is still connected,","label":"bigbrownbeav","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_2036r3","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1394520769,"simScore":0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1394580190,"simScore":0.767846786570752,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":123,"links":[0],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"bonams","label":"just my 2cents as an aircraft maintenance engineer\n\n**probable theory for MH370: right wing structural failure?**\n\n[aircraft course changed from 25° track to 40° track](http://i.imgur.com/3fj3qZ8.png) during its last moments on radar and its speed reduced from 474knots to 471knots.

Been following this pretty closely and the following is the only theory I have come up with that I can't pick holes in so I had to type it out. \n\nPlane disappeared at a very specific point on the flight path at a waypoint which also happens to be the switch over point between Malaysia and Vietnam air traffic control. Pilot was heard to say 'all right, good night' to Malaysia after being informed of the switch over. Vietnam were never contacted. This timing would suggest knowledge/prior planning.\n\nAt this point I think the pilot would have initiated his plan. Being an over night flight the cabin crew would have been less active anyway but the pilot may have spoken to cabin crew in such a way to give him more time alone in the cockpit. He then will have quickly incapacitated the other pilot in the cockpit. He would have steered the plane west as seen on Malaysian radar before switching off all tracking and comms and changing altitude to effectively become 'invisible'. Now invisible, he would change heading again to north east over the South China Sea. At this point crew and passengers would be none the wiser, the wayward pilot could have even made an announcement over the tannoy to reassure people about any recent maneuvres. This would explain why there was no distress calls made by either the pilot, crew or passengers. It would also explain why the plane was thought to have changed its heading to the west.\n\nWe now know that the plane never re-appeared on any radar so therefore it never made it to any land mass. So it must have gone into the sea. The Mallaca Strait radar sighting and search has drawn a blank.\n\nTherefore I believe that the plane headed north east to the South China Sea where the pilot knew that radar could be avoided and phone signal would be non existent. It was then deliberately crashed into the water. This could be an attempt to make it as hard as possible to track down the wreckage and therefore the true cause of the crash. \n\nThe above corresponds to the oil rig sighting and the recent Chinese 'wreckage' pictures. Obviously I can't comment on either pilot on board but you'd need a huge amount of experience and knowledge to pull off this plan so effectively. Whatever happened, I'm sure it will be found soon now that the search is being expanded over the South China Sea, and hopefully the truth will be revealed.\n\nRIP to all of those on board.\n","duration":"","id":266,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cg16l5a","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4,"level":5,"title":"Malaysian Airlines MH370 Discussion Thread","label":"axolotl_peyotl","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_2055n3","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1394579370,"simScore":0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1394698573,"simScore":0.7719542546689746,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},{"index":267,"links":[0],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"mh370ob","label":"Michael McKay's witness puts plane at crash site located approx 8\"20'33 N 108\"11'58E being approximately 176Km SE (102.03\") of Con Doa Island .\n\nChina satellite image of wreckage at 105.63E, 6.7N appears very accurate when combined with seas at 225\"-230\" from witness crash site.\n\n\"When I observed the burning (plane) it appeared to be in one piece.\" \"Until the flames went out\" - this is interesting and I can not make head nor tail of what may cause a fire to start and then go out (Engines???).\n\nPossible scenario is that MH370 had fuselage or wing structural failure from prior accident.\n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/oil-rig-worker-thinks-he-saw-malaysia-flight-in-flames-2014-3?IR=T\n\nhttp://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=11218881\n\nhttp://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/03/09/malaysia-jet-was-damaged-2012","duration":"","id":267,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cg16vpt","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4,"level":5,"title":"Malaysian Airlines MH370 Discussion Thread","label":"axolotl_peyotl","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_2055n3","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1394579370,"simScore":0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1394699199,"simScore":0.7532162701722146,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":268,"links":[0],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"singhapura","label":"I think the explanation proposed on Lowyat (http://www.lowyat.net/2014/03/was-there-a-problem-with-the-mh370-boeing-777-200-aircraft/) sounds most plausible.

Lets face it, horribly beings are always coming up with new innovative ways to slide through the cracks of airline security. In case you haven't noticed, my thoughts are directed at terrorism and heres what my brain seemed to come up with piecing the mystery together.\n\nIs it possible flight 370 was hijacked.. yes of course. If this was the case, why hasn't any body made a claim about such an act?, terrorists like to do that sort of thing you know, make a stand point and take credit for their horrific intentions. For a minute lets assume flight 370 was hijacked and take into the consideration that terrorists are always coming up with innovative plans.\n\nIs it a possibility that flight 370 was landed safely, after being hijacked, and having its location systems deactivated (possibility), at a remote location that could be further undetected. Think about it for a minute, these terrorists could obtain a devastating suicidal homing missile the size of a building and a further 239 alive hostages. This aircraft could be used in future horrific plans and could just be the beginning of something terrible.\n\nI can briefly demonstrate a couple of evidences that might support this theory.\n\n*Some family's of flight 370 were able to call their flight victims cell phone briefly before being disconnected.

Here's my theory:\n\nIranian hijacker has a knockout agent, gas mask and tools to defeat the cockpit door lock smuggled onto the plane during servicing. At altitude, the hijacker triggers release of the knockout agent, hides in the bathroom with his gas mask on until everyone is unconscious. He defeats the cockpit door lock, removes the unconscious pilots, turns off all the radios and GPS, puts on the pilots oxygen mask and then depressurizes the plane. At 30,000 feet, everyone will be dead in 5 minute due to lack of oxygen.\n\nHijacker flies the plane to standard waypoints and merges with other commercial traffic to cloak the planes passage. Past the Adman Islands, he stays below India's military radar and makes his way to Iran and lands at a secret airport. The aircraft is hidden in a hanger and the dead passengers are removed and buried.\n\nThe plane is then repainted, additional fuel tanks are added and a bomb bay door is fitted and 2 nukes are loaded. Plane is flown to NYC and the first nuke is dropped. 30 minutes later, before anyone can figure out what he's doing, he's over DC and the second nuke is detonated.\n\nWhy would Iran do this? Because they have lost billions due to sanctions so in retaliation, they will cause trillions of dollars of damage to US economy by nuking NYC and DC.\n\nA companion operation is that they will simultaneously nuke the Saudi oil fields which will take 10 million bpd off of the market, causing a global oil panic and shortage, thus Iran's oil will suddenly be in huge demand, leading to the elimination of sanctions, which is their end game.\n\nUnfortunately, you don't need to steal an extended range 777 just to nuke the Saudi Arabia oil fields so I believe a USA nuclear 911 is imminent.\n\nPaperJoe","duration":"","id":273,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cg36gus","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4,"level":5,"title":"Malaysian Airlines MH370 Discussion Thread","label":"axolotl_peyotl","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_2055n3","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1394579370,"simScore":0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1394916173,"simScore":0.8429674084601522,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":274,"links":[0],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"techbelle","label":"here's my theory - it flew out to sea widely enough to avoid detection and is now in Pakistan.

Why? Because this would lend support to those same theories regarding remote piloting on 9/11. What's more, who would ever feel safe going on an airliner if they knew that there was any possibility that somebody could remotely take control of the plane.... effectively turning it into a drone.\n\nso tldr; story might be sketchy, but it touches on some interesting possibilities.","duration":"","id":336,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cn2itrw","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4,"level":5,"title":"MH370 Was Hacked And Shot Down By American Air Force Says Airline Boss Marc Dugain","label":"ob1_kenobi","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_2q2kpp","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1419287929,"simScore":0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1419309366,"simScore":0.8347551038574401,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":337,"links":[0],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"iliad_keys","label":"Not sure why I'm sceptical about this story.
