I honestly don't think this is an attack on Romney. It's an attack on the idiots who despite the evidence and none of their own still think Obama wasn't born in the United States. I don't think anyone is honestly trying to stop Romney from running. 
Actually it's not inaccurate. Romney has just as much proof that he was born in the US as Obama does. Both of their father's weren't born in the United States but their Mother's were. Romney is just as "foreign" as Obama is (Not at all).
I'm not using "foreign" the same way you are, and in all honesty if you aren't Native American you're foreign too. If you are born in the US, live in the US most of your life I don't consider you foreign. You're American.

What do you suggest I read specifically? Obama meets every metric as does Romney. They are both eligible to run for President.
I get it, I just think it's worthless nonsense. People can speculate and question whatever they want, but the fact of the matter is Hawaii certifies Obama as being born here. That's the end of the story. Obama and Romney share this fact as well as having foreign born father's. That's all the headline is saying too.
