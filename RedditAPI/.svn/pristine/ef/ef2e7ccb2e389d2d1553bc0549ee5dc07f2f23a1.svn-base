Jesus Hussein Christ!
Makes one question his moral fiber.
&gt;*I usually pipe up and try to defend conservatives and stuff,...*

I have to ask - why?  What, given all the insane bullshit they spew, would be worth defending about a so-called "conservative" these days?  Seriously?  I can't for the life of me think of ONE thing they allegedly stand for that I've heard them make a rational argument for.
Ad hominem attacks are unproductive, I agree.  However, I think there's more than enough (admittedly somewhat circumstantial) evidence that the overall march of the far right is discriminatory in nature toward women and minorities.  Witness the recent birth control nonsense, the so-called "personhood" bills in several southern states, the hardline stance against gay rights, the completely unwarranted restrictions on voting rights, etc.  Additionally, look at the HUGE increase in anti-government armed militia hate groups over the last 3 years.  To me (at the very least) it's no coincidence that the number of hard line right wing militias have ballooned in the years since the nation's first black president took office.  Imagine if *just a handful* of minority groups (or even ONE) formed armed militias... it would be the national crisis du jour for Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, and Glenn Beck.

I sincerely mean no offense, but the "low tax, small government, and personal responsibility" mantra fits the mold of right wing "talking points" perfectly.  I don't mean to be demeaning when I say that, rather I am trying to illustrate that it could be found in virtually every Fox News pundit clip for the last 3½ years.

The tax thing is a huge difference you and I have - or maybe a huge similarity, although I doubt it.  The wealthiest Americans are taxed at the lowest rate since the 1950s and under the plan of the leading GOP candidate they would actually see a tax reduction while the rest of America would see a tax increase.  This is to say nothing of what this would add to the deficit.

Frankly the deficit is, to me, way overblown.  Is it a serious issue?  Sure.  Is a "sky is falling" impending disaster?  No.  We are nowhere near as bad off debt wise as Europe (save Germany perhaps), for example.  Certainly our national debt is something to be dealt with, no question, but there are better ways to deal with it than tax cuts and more pressing issues.

The phrase "personal responsibilty" began surfacing in very high usage in early 2009.  It was one of the many phrases from the rhetoric mill that is Frank Luntz.  As for small government, where were the right wing intelligentsia back when the vaunted Ronald Reagan was doubling the size of government?  Why won't the right wing do anything about out of control military spending?¹

I do understand *some* of the appeal of the right wing...

I am 48 years old.  My first vote in a national election was for Ronald Reagan in 1984 (I was a tad too young in 1980), but it was based on the ignorance of voting the way my family did.  My grandfather was a local GOP elected official in NC for decades, my parents voted Republican (surprising, given the fact that my father and mother were both anti-war college teachers in the 1970s), my wife is still a registered Republican (although she hasn't voted for a GOP presidential candidate since Bush I back in 1988 or '92).  Before I started understanding the political big picture, and started seeking news sources outside the mainstream, I fell right in line with the family tradition.  The last decade and a half have been nothing short of ~~incredible~~ INSANE in terms of how far off the deep end the GOP has gone.  Perhaps most amazing about the whole thing is the way the right wing masses gravitate toward pundits like Beck and Limbaugh, without questioning for a second the validity of their words.

I didn't mean to get off on a "bash the right" rant... I really didn't.  But I sometimes get a little passionate in my replies.

Anyway, thanks for answering my sincere question.

¹  Ron Paul is the only right wing candidate to offer a plan that won't increase the debt, but it comes at an enormous cost to programs benefitting the poor.  On top of that, for all of Paul's anti-war rhetoric about bringing troops home from our foreign wars (something I agree with), he has no plan for them once they're back.  This leads me to believe he would be quite happy to have them homeless and not getting the *government paid* care they so desperately need (and will need for years to come).
Is "retarda" the collective noun and they're just inbreeding like rabbits?
