One of them is Public Policy Polling (PPP), a polling firm that conducts automated polls for both public consumption and for liberal and Democratic clients.\n\n\u0026gt;Take a look at this exchange, for example, between The New York Times’ Nate Cohn and PPP’s Tom Jensen. Cohn discovered that in 2012, the racial composition of PPP’s polls was correlated in an unusual way with President Obama’s performance among white voters in their surveys. If Obama was performing especially poorly among whites in one PPP poll, it tended to have a higher share of nonwhite voters, which boosted Obama’s result. And if Obama was doing relatively well among whites, PPP projected less nonwhite turnout, keeping his lead in check. As a result, PPP’s polls tended to show an unusually steady race between Obama and Mitt Romney.\n\n\u0026gt;I’m picking on PPP for a reason: They’re the biggest herders in the business. Here’s the chart I showed you before, but with only PPP’s polls highlighted. On average, in states with at least three other recent polls, their polls deviated from the polling average by only 1.6 percentage points.

Congress and the Bush presidencies? Randomly pick 30 republicans in the house and look at their last 100 votes as well as their donors and you will find tons of conflict of interest on 95% of them. Beyond that Republican policy is not economically sound and hasn\u0027t been for ages. Beyond that randomly attacking middle eastern countries is not good foreign policy, I could go on and on, but suffice to say, just because their half your government, and just because the other half also sort of sucks and is corrupt doesn\u0027t mean I have to not call a spade a spade. Republicans are bought and paid for. 95% of voters who vote for them are voting against their own financial interests, and their governence has a negative effect on your country. Ignoring these facts because it\u0027s intolerant not to is stupid, and you guys are all about free speech. This is my free and honest opinion. Disagree if you like, but the post is literally about how over half of Republicans believe something that\u0027s just fucking stupid. Not something that\u0027s just wrong, trickle down economics is just wrong, this is 54% of them believing something straight up retarded. Full retard. 54% of Republican voters are fully retarded. There I said it. I understand that this subreddit is about political discussion and moderates, but the American political spectrum is not centered around the actual political spectrum. \"Realty has a well known liberal bias\".","duration":"","id":202,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_cuojiwa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":201,"links":[200],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Corranus","label":"\u0026gt;I\u0027m all fine with right wing views, but the Republican party of America is extraordinarily bought and paid for, as well as just generally hugely incompetant\n\nWhat are you basing this on?\n\n\u0026gt;Beyond that the 95% of idiots who are voting for them are idiots because they\u0027re voting against their own interests\n\nOr this?\n\n","duration":"","id":201,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_cuogu2s","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":200,"links":[199],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Tasadar","label":"I mean okay I guess.
