Do you really believe Obama is a Muslim?
Thank you, I have to see something like this almost daily on my facebook feed. Of course, i have a bunch of redneck "Christians" as friends and family, so this makes sense. 
Why?
To me it does not, but apparently to the rest of the conservative world its almost the number one thing they complain about him. 
Frankly, i wasn't trying to get into "what he's done and hasn't done" debate, just a simple question for Christians, and wanting a simple answer. So why do you think he is doing all those things?
I retract my statement, its not the number 1 thing they complain about, but it is pretty high up on the list, but that is why i also said "almost".

I wouldn't have asked for your opinion if i didn't want it, so yes, enlighten me.
Do you have some proof to back that?
