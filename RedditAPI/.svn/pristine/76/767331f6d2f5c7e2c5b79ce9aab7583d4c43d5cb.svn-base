I was trying to figure out if she was being coached or something, the awkward pauses, sounded like a skitzo. Who talks to an answering machine like that? 
Stupid fuckers have no idea how good we have it here in America and think that if we take away the safety nets that nothing would change. They believe that things like public education, national health-care, welfare, social security, unemployment, ect, are handouts to unworthy people (except when it's them) but they have no problem supporting a socialist military that sucks up half the budget. I'm not sure what we can do to stop this behavior, it's really sad. At this point they are so brainwashed that you can't even talk to them anymore, they ignore all facts and are blinded by hatred of "the other side". Words are being poisoned by the propaganda, words like Socialism, Liberals, ect, and they become code words to short cut the thinking. They have no idea what they even mean half the time.
Haha birther, you lose, we'll never show you the real birth certificate, it's a huge conspiracy and you'll never figure it out, hahahahaaaaa!

Yep, the same scumbags that had no problem with torture.

Really? You support torture? I don't give a shit how open minded you think you are, your mind already seems to be a vile place.
Well, he has to convince the morons that he is not satan himself. It's funny too, cause they keep saying that we think he's the Messiah.
I've always thought Obama was too smart for religion.
