every man because when it comes crashing down and it hurts inside youve got to take a stand it doesnt help to hide  hulkamania upvote even my right to party you clearly have not been following the news from florida white hispanic is all the rage now i think it has more to do with americans just figuring out what most europeans already knowlatinos are white in america french and italians are somehow white while people from spain are not  well its further confused that the white spaniards bred with the native indians in what is now mexico the people who cross the border to find work in the usa tend to be darker skinned indians or part indian thus most of the hispanics that americans come into contact with are dark skinned  true but how many white people claim to be part cherokee i went to college with a guy who was  cherokee and looked as white as any european  precisely you clearly have never left your home state ive been to every state and about a dozen or so countries you clearly assume a lot based on small amounts of information  hmm is that a new one racial categorization completely eludes me you can be any race and also hispanic at the same time think of it as a prestige class in dampd  i dont really know what dampd is so you can be asian hispanic is it based on parents like one parent being hispanic and the other being something else edit im ethiopian and ive always been confused about how to fill in those boxes on the census for example i feel like most people would find them inadequate but maybe there is something im missing sorry dampd is dungeon amp dragons a fantasy roleplaying game basically the deal is that unlike being white africanamerican asian etcwhich are all classified as racesbeing hispanic is a matter of ethnicity and heritage it has to do with the history of spanish conquest and colonization and the populations they had influence on the largest asian hispanic group is probably from peru they have a sizable population of chinese and japanese descendants i see thanks so much heres a link to a studydescribing how african and asian americans as groups are less associated with the national category american than are white americans really interesting  probably has something to do with the fact that the race of people who created america were white didnt the slaves help create america what colour were they  your move americathis is all fucking moronic wasnt he mormonicim so hilarious when republicans try to put a base on the moonnasas top people on the case omg this is killing me lmfao as a mormon i and my  wives and  children find this offensive believe it or not mexicans can be caucasian  i knowstunning  most of mexicos ruling class is and the people who fled the united states disavowed their citizenship and established a polygamous mormon cult  they too are white mexicanswhy do the romneys hate america i wonder if romneys grandfather formally renounced his citizenship and whether or not george romney came as an immigrant i was surprised to learn louis ck is mexican american and spanish is his first language amercian a real mercianand a reeeaal heero real human beeng  mexico is in america people downvoting you have definitely not heard about the iphone app mitt romney released a free iphone app for his campaign and part of it or maybe all of it was a camera app with different wordsframes you could put over your pictures like im with mitt and mitt  but one of them said a better amercia spelled amercia it is funny there is already a tumblr about it he wears blue jeans and flannel america doesnt matter is white obama is half does that mean he only has to prove half hid citizenship  no flaw in this logic  he certainly wont have to produce papers to walk down the street in arizona a white unicorn you mean romney is amercian ftfy  there you go another bigot bringing race into politics  didnt he run for president how was he allowed if mexican better amercia  rags  riches  amercian i thats pretty funny birthers contention with obama fact they think birth certificate illegitimate dad foreign gtthey think yeah i dont know if theres a whole lot of that going on gt they really really really hope thatbetter foreigner is just the closest word to nigger they could come up with and still say it in publici want to point out that john mccain was born in motherfucking panama no kidding  and while birthers hounded obama in the last election cycle they ignored mccain he was brn on us soil in panama  a military base is not us soil  the us might purchase the land but its still panama  unlike an embassy or consulate which is us soil actually no he wasnt born on us soil he was born in the panama canal zone which is an insular areahe was certainly a us citizen by virtue of his parents citizenship but whether he was a natural born citizen is open to debate also the relevant laws granting his citizenship werent passed until well after his birth ipso factostyle  ex poste facto touche mr chief justice yeah technically george washington our first president might not be a natural born citizen because at the time of his birth american was still a collection of colonies and not the usa  true in fact i think our first president actually born in the the usa was martin van buren  that being said because they were a citizen at the time of the adoption of the constitution they were allowed the presidency because of how article ii section  is worded there is no us soil in panama but thanks for a chuckle  he was born in the embassy you do realize the land is leased right i didnt say he was born in the embassy simply that there is us soil in panamaalso leasing land is taking temporary ownership of it try again not originally the law saying he was a citizen didnt exist he was grandfathered in is that like how dracula carries a coffin full of soil from transylvania to sleep in not sure why you got downvoted youre absolutely correctseems i was mistaken see belowedit i erred  the point is both were born on us soil but only one has birthers questioning him no hes not mccain was born before a law was put into effect naturalizing children born under these conditions the law happened to retroactively apply to people in his position though so hes still eligible the irony is that mccains eligibility hinges on a technicality but no one questions his eligibility because hes white meanwhile obama was born in one of the  states has provided all the necessary documentation to prove such and hes still called a kenyan i get the irony and think the whole thing is plain stupid but it seems that my understanding that a military base is in nearly all cases the sovereign territory of the country which ownsoperates it was incorrect gtc  birth on us military base outside of the united states or birth on us embassy or consulate premises abroad   gt despite widespread popular belief us military installations abroad and us diplomatic or consular facilities abroad are not part of the united states within the meaning of the th amendment  a child born on the premises of such a facility is not born in the united states and does not acquire us citizenship by reason of birth gt the status of diplomatic and consular premises arises from the rules of law relating to immunity from the prescriptive and enforcement jurisdiction of the receiving state the premises are not part of the territory of the united states of america  see restatement third of foreign relations law vol  sec  comment a and c   see also persinger v iran  fd  dc cir but he was still born to two naturalborn us citizens im not sure that qualifies as a technicality thoughedit formatting gtbut he was still born to two naturalborn us citizens im not sure that qualifies as a technicality thoughthats very true i didnt really mean to imply that mccain was ineligible but slide through on a technicality rather that his eligibility was more muddled by technicalities than obamas both were equally valid candidates in terms of eligibility it just seems as though the birthers were focusing so intently on the color of one mans skin that they didnt bother to even check the other guys eligibility as i recall mccain didnt allow himself to get caught up in the whole controversy i still have a shred of respect for the man because of thatedit im trying to find the law i cited by the way as i believe it specifically dealt with us military basis in panama in essence if i remember correctly it means that mccain was retroactively born on us soil at the time of his birth it was not considered such but the later law applies to children born before it took effect if you find it then by all means post it up id be interested to see itmccain did alright by the birther thing he said he disagreed with them and left it at that hes downvoted because hes not while i do not doubt there are plenty of racists in the tea party movement one of the biggest hotbeds of the birther movement do you really think they feel the same way about condoleezza rice  alan keys  michael steele who btw was labeled as an uncle tom and other disparaging terms by baltimore democrats  colin powelli think it has more to do with the fact that view him as a socialist you think the tea party loves colin powel and michael steele  lol can you show me an example where they dont   i happen to be a republican  does that make me a racist  does that mean that any criticism i have of obama means i am taking his complexion in to my argument  hint i voted for him  this is like saying anything critical of israel makes one an antisemite  edit remember that dude who showed up to a tea party rally with a rifle and janeane garofalo pointed the image out as an example of extremist racism  the guy with the rifle is black  they are a very slim minority but there are black tea partiersalso remember that condoleeza rice and colin powell are neocon darlings  colin powell may be the outs now because of his distancing himself from the extreme right well both sides use propaganda to bolster their self and attack the other side no matter how much of it you can recognize and rationalize it still has an effect on you which can be very subtle or perhaps very clearmost young democrats think republicans are more racist the vast majority of people in america have gotten over blatant racism most awkward moments are caused by friendly ignorance and not hate this doesnt stop everybody from thinking republicans are racist especially when they are given evidence and it is repeated endlesslythere are numerous examples of racism in politics over the last two or three decades hundreds or thousands of examples and when you have millions or hundreds of millions of clips with politicians or activists this isnt unexpected well the hard core tea party guy across the street hates both of them  are you a hard core tea partier  i am guessing you are not as you voted for obama  heres one for you  i voted for romney for gov in ma and for obama for pres   i am not a tea party guy at all no fucking way   im a rino and proud of it then my comment didnt really apply to you did it did you just flipflop or did you evolve i have no doubt that they view him as a socialisti also have no doubt that almost none of them know what socialism isthey yell out socialist and saul alinsky because theyve heard it mentioned on tha teevee  id bet almost none of them know much about either subject  id bet most of them cant spell saul alinskys name correctlyhes a socialist  and an atheist marxist communist  with an evil americahating baptist minister at the church he attends  and hes a secret musliman atheist baptist muslim gti think it has more to do with the fact that fox news calls him a socialistftfyto be fair most of them probably have no idea what a socialist is and on top of that have no idea that theyd probably agree with a lot of socialist ideas if they werent labeled as socialist which of course theyve been told is a bad thing socialist is another code word for nigger   obama is not even close to socialist in his political views and actions  youre joking right the only person who seems obsessed with race in this debate is you you cant understand white people disliking someone of another race who you are so infatuated with old white people can be motivated by other factors than race you apparently can not look im not making this up lee atwater former republican national committee chair and advisor to bush sr explained it this waygtyou start out in  by saying nigger nigger nigger by  you cant say nigger  that hurts you backfires so you say stuff like forced busing states rights and all that stuff youre getting so abstract now that youre talking about cutting taxes and all these things youre talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is that blacks get hurt worse than whites and subconsciously maybe that is part of it im not saying that but im saying that if it is getting that abstract and that coded that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other you follow me  because obviously sitting around saying we want to cut this is much more abstract than even the busing thing and a hell of a lot more abstract than nigger niggerits been going on a long time look at this photo from  in little rock wow that picture from  makes me realize youre right i now know that the people in  calling barack obama a socialist are using it as a pseudonym for nigger after having seen that picture youre right  i agree with your view that obama is not a socialist but again i dont think they are calling him that due to the color of his skin  they am talk radio types said the same thing about clinton when he was president  sure there are racists that hate on obama because hes black  but there are plenty that dont like him for his stances especially on taxation and spending on social programs but not agreeing with his political views does not make one a racist  again rice powell keys steele cain all black conservatives colin powell not so much  the right never has issue with them   ssshh facts scare democrats democrats can be as racist as they want like calling a black man uncle tom etc and everyone is ok with it two of our last three secretaries of state have been africanamerican  our current president and attorney general are africanamericans  minority candidates are winning office even in predominantly white districts in states that were once part of the confederacy  yet somehow half of the country the half that elected the president that appointed those two secretaries of state in fact are a bunch of racists who barely restrain an impulse to use racial epithetsi think it might be time to toss ridiculous cries of racism in the same godwin bucket into which we throw all the youre a naziworse than hitler crap birthers dont make up half the country theyre an extremist group and yes they are angrier and more racist than most americans from my limited life experience i would say that at least  of white people will use the nword laugh at racist jokes express disdain about black people etc to my shame i sometimes go along with it or at least dont call them out on itdo you really think most americans arent racist come on be honest   may be a bit much i dont think ive ever heard a white person say the nword in real life beyond once or twice in high school while discussing huck finn i think that overt racism isnt the majority opinion anymore still the subtle framing of racism can take its toll if the point is hammered home by referring to obama as a kenyan anticolonialist as a foreigner as not christian and not truly american  the drum beats on and on and the pattern seems strikingid say the majority of people dont buy into it  but it could be worth  percentage points  in other words it could decide an electionside note  why is anticolonialism and hatred of british colonizing power such a bad thing  it makes me wonder if the tea party types have any idea about the era from which they draw their zany costumes  that whole original tea party was an anticolonialist action against britain  the very same colonizing force that kenya once called british east africa rebelled againstif obama really is of that mindset then he should be the hands down tea party candidate  they should be in love with him  but they have no sense of history beyond last weeks headlines during the  election they called or hinted that obama was a terrorist a foreigner and a muslim  and not just fringe groups  the mainstream candidates and pundits  i do not doubt for a second that that wasnt a tactic aimed at riling up a powerful base that would vote on race fear and xenophobia  im not saying everyone or even the majority who voted against obama were racist im saying that race was used by the elite to scare a significant portion of voters into voting against him if this was the s theyd have said dont elect the sand nigger in  they are forced to say dont elect barack hussein obama he pals around with terrorists  the only difference is the republicans were no longer able to use the blunt nigger tactic   given that president obamas current campaign is airing ads comparing mitt romney to john mccain precisely because that mainstream candidate in  objected to the sort of things about which youre complaining i think your argument is invalid the obama campaign is not using subtle racism to stoke xenophobic fears by comparing one white american to another youre fundamentally misunderstanding my point   i understood it completely  im telling you why youre wrong  you cant argue that mainstream candidates had called or hinted that obama was a terrorist a foreigner and a muslim when obama himself is running an ad showing that the mainstream candidate from  was denouncing exactly the thing about which youre complaining wait just a second  gti think it might be time to toss ridiculous cries of racism in the same godwin bucket into which we throw all the youre a naziworse than hitler crapgtso the gop doesnt use racism in elections anymore then  what about john mccains black baby during the republican primaries  that was clearly the bush campaignhigh profile national campaign level republicans even use racism in primaries against other republicans  but somehow they wouldnt use it against an actual black guy a black guy who is an democrat the enemyit is all about picking up percentage points and the modern gop doesnt mind a little racism if it lands them a net positive in points at the polls in  the senate passed sres  which directly recognized john mccain as a naturalborn us citizen despite being born in the canal zone in  before that he technically wasnt eligible to run and was considered a naturalized citizenfrom the state department despite widespread popular belief us military installations abroad and us diplomatic or consular facilities are not part of the united states within the meaning of the th amendment a child born on the premises of such a facility is not subject to the jurisdiction of the united states and does not acquire us citizenship by reason of birth interesting  that action would seem to alter the meaning of the constitution then  so the senate thought they could do that without a constitutional amendment  pretty ballsy senate i just googled senate resolution and i saw a lot of antiobama websites saying that it proves he isnt a us citizen im going to clean my eyeballs and earballs by googling kittens and watching ted talks foreigner please ok but remember you asked for it meanwhile cnn says nigger without even trying to cover it upimagine if fox news had said that  but cnn does it nobody cares i imagine she said it because it was conducive to the story at hand its not like she went around calling people names she was quoting a suspected criminals facebook page which contained relavent information because nobody on either side of the spectrum considers them as a valid news source anywaysif i want to read peoples tweets ill go to twitter ya but mccain is white gtforeigner is just the closest word to nigger they could come up withactually socialist is closer they originally thought his birth certificate was illegitimate  but once they realized it was fine they needed to modify their belief so that they could continue to believe hes foreignwhich makes sense because the birth certificate wasnt the true issue anyway it was merely a rationalization for the fact hes blackhes black and theyre makingup reasons to hate him  thats all there is no the issue was that they didnt want a democrat in the white house the racism thing was invented to paint all the birthers and opposition to obama as nutjobs not a lot needed for the former group  i respect legitimate opposition to obamas policies  i oppose many myselfbut the simple fact is that around half of republicans are birthers  that means nearly half of them are raving lunatics  theyll believe any halfassed thing you tell them and disbelieve objective facts when they get in the waytheres no painting needed here theyve done it all themselves i would really like to see the data that says that half of all republicans are birthers none that i know are i can tell you that and few to none in the house and senate  and id also guess that you and your friends have no problem with evolutionbut a large number of republicans do  and your party panders to this group  they have power to pick your candidates  they influence your policy  and they are terrifying they still think both released birth certificates are forgeries they think they have incontrovertible proof but the obama administration is so powerful and farreaching that theyre able to keep everyone in power in the country from using the informationalso sheriff joes cold case posse has proof and theyre going to release it in a month or so actually we hate him for his lack of doing what he promised to do no real job creation and adding  trillion to our debt and a housing market still in the toilet  its been  years and hes still blaming george w bush its been  years and idiots like you still havent learned the first thing about economicsplease tell me about how the stimulus had no effect on the job market  i need a good laugh today look friend  the fact that so many of you are still harping on the ridiculous birther thing is proof that you dont really care about the factsyou just dont  obama could be sending you gold and youd still hate him for putting you in a higher tax bracket  youre insane actually the birth certificate was made on a computer last year using acrobat  the latest theories the father on the actual birth certificate is frank marshall davis and not barack obama sr second theory is that the reason he wont release his college records is because he claimed that he was born in kenya or indonesia to get preferential admission you make reynolds a happy co im at a loss to figure that out  i must have missed something tin foil for hats  aaaah  fewf  i was dumbfounded  thanks  now i can upvote it  now that i know what it means there are many types of birthers some believe that because of his dual citizenship obama was born with divided loyalties and therefore isnt eligible others adopted a similar view that says a natural born citizen must be born from two citizen parents the birth certificate conspiracy theory was fading until sheriff arpaio resurrected it by doing so he set the birthers back two years and made them look more foolish than if he had never opened his mouth   sheriff joe is a terrible dolt of a human being hate that guy  toughest sheriff in the closet gtsome believe that because of his dual citizenship obama was born with divided loyaltiesif that is the case then quite a few members of congress should resign because a lot of them have dual citizenship especially jewish members of congress  not to mention other branches of govt  whats even more ridiculous is that a foreign country could just grant citizenship to one candidate or all of them and that person would be ineligible according to this idiotic theory   a government cant grant dual citizenship to an american youre either born with it or you never have it you obviously dont know hat youre talking about  well no you can apply for dual citizenship if you marry a national of the country depending on the country you dont just have to be born there thats why michelle bachman applied for dual citizenship in switzerland for her and her kids because her husband was from there they could legally grant it to them she of course withdrew her application so she could prove she was  for america   wrong  my kids are eligible for irish citizenship all we have to do is go to the embassy and fill out some forms  however they are not yet irish citizensmy wife also has irish citizenship but didnt get it until her teens  her father was born in galway the obviously in that sentence is what makes you so adorably wrong yes being american is like flame retardant clothing for citizenship other countries can never grant citizenship to an american citizen because of the magical forcefield the american oath of alligance grants to those who spout its verses the constitution only specifies that the president must be a natural born citizen article  of section  erghmmm your facts are really getting in the way of the hives opinions please leave reddit gtbecause a lot of them have dual citizenshipim fairly sure the jewish ones can have dual citizenship if they want it but how many congressman actually have a second citizenship very good point all american jews have dual citizenship gtdivided loyalties and therefore isnt eligibleim sick of this idea who ever said that people who run a country need to be nationalistic our country is the only one worth living in assholesthe world would be a much better place if more people were multinationalbiculturalbilingual with vested interests in multiple countries were no longer a world of thiscountryversusthatone were a global entity and we all need to start acting like it thats not the point the point is if your best interests favor another country instead of american ie a jewish senator who is an israeli citizen who wants us to attack iran to protect israel then you shouldnt be in charge of handling this countrys foreign policy its not about being nationalistic or thinking our country is the only one worth living in if you are in charge of this country it complicates things if you are loyal to another country not everyone is going to simply ignore their nationalities upbringing cultural heritage and make a dispassionate decision only they would never use that argument against a jew running for president or at least didnt when leiberman was running for vp which has the same eligibility requirements as the president thats the point you shouldnt specifically favor one country that makes you biased narrowminded and unable to consider the good of the human race rather than the good of your countrypeople who are looking out for the uss economic interests specifically for example may condone exploitative economic policies in less industrialized countries notice that this isnt a hypothetical it actually happens gtand unable to consider the good of the human race rather than the good of your countrythe president isnt elected to look out for the good of the whole human race hes elected to look out for the good america which is the problem were discussing this is an outdated mentality that needs to be overcome the us president isnt the head of the world itd be nice in the future if we could all be more peaceful and care for people from other countries but thats nothing thats going to change now or  years from now and as far as problems go its probably the least of the problems america has these days our presidents dont even look out for the interests of most americans just our rich i love this whole global entity thing  doesnt exist my friend   hell europe isnt even one entity  nor is the us  despite what you might think thinking globally is better for big business than it is for actual people   i think the recent discovery that the publishing agents bio of obama listed him as being born in kenya also has aided the resurgence of the birther voice  i feel like the natural born thing is what theyve been twisting and contorting around as their last line of attack so this is awesome while they all might have different theories about why they think hes not eligible the important thing is that it all comes down to not liking a black guy who is more moderate than the gop holding an office they believe should belong to them  but racism isnt cool anymore so the hip thing to do is create conspiracy theories about birth certificates and dual citizenships who is this sheriff and who gives a fuck what he says gtsome believe that because of his dual citizenship obama was born with divided loyalties and therefore isnt eligiblethere is no part of us law that accepts or acknowledges dual citizenshipone is either a us citizen or not in the eyes of our laws the only minor distinction is natural born vs naturalized and obama was never naturalized as he was a citizen since birth by virtue of his place of birth michele bachmann would like a word with you gtnot that his dad was foreignbirthers attack from every angle  mother was too young father was born outside country obama was born out of country more crazy stuff everything that matters when electing a president thank you people are stupid its where you were born not where your father was born they had a hearing in georgia over it exactly president obama is an american and was born in the us same for romneybut both romneys parents were us citizens  president obamas father was not americanso maybe romney is less foreign hes also less black  obama is less tall than romneywho cares maybe romney forged his birth certificate have we seen any evidence to suggest that mitt romney isnt a mexican his halfsister too some how she has a hawaiian certificate of live birth even though she was born elsewhere  as everyone in this thread is likely to have forgotten the issue was that after someone that seemed respectable in the political community brought up the chance of illegitmacy of the birth certificate the obama group refused to release their certificate it wasnt until a year or two after more then enough time to ensure that any fake that was planted didnt have any contradictory evidence that it was releasedpretty much the obamas birth certificate is the right wings version of the left wings conspiracy about the shift towards totalitarianism and how we are already in a police state and other shit like that  some people read the natural born citizen requirement to include both parents as citizensthis is a somewhat reasonable but disfavored interpretation  his dad was white sarcasm  also his dad ran for president too here is what i find absolutely hilarious romneys campaign issued a certificate of live birth and no one is bitching about it  despite the whole uproar over obamas clb there is none here  hysterical yes and all everyone needs to do is zoom  at the birth certificate and youll see the letters are in  different resolutions a very poor fake by anyones standards  actually both since his father was kenyan and his mother was a minor he shouldnt even have been given us citizenship in the first place and surely not a naturalized citizen vote for a mexcian for president    so how can we know that romney was not born secretly in mexico i mean he may have faked and forged his birth certificate since he clearly have mexican ties do you really want a mexican as president of usa    in case necessary  s the birthers are spilt some think his certificate is a forgery some thinks its legit but because his dad wasnt a citizen he cant be president or that he never became president because roberts fudged the oath and tripped obama up talk about an article with no substance this is redditcom anything antiromney will be upvoted regardless of how little bearing it has on anything yes this ridiculous romney eligiblity story is a huge red herring to confuse the dim masses and detract from real questions about obamas eligibilityas usual on this issue i have to state that i am not american and have no political agenda although if i was american id vote democrat for what its worth however since i know more about this issue than  of americans i feel obliged to weigh infact that both romney and obamas fathers were born outside the usa is completely irrelevant to the eligibility debate their parental birth place has no bearing on natural born citizen status of their sonswhat is relevant is  the nationality of their parents when their sons were born and  if their parents were not both american citizens where their son was born nb as the law stood in  when obama was bornboth romneys parents were american so he is american natural born however only one of obamas parents was american his mother and unfortunately she was too young to pass on her citizenship automatically when her son was born as the law stood in this means that if obama was born outside the usa he was not american at birth the definition of natural born its as simple as that this is the truth and if you think otherwise you have been misinformedthe question remains will we ever be privy to a genuine birth certificate stating obamas actual birth placeedited for clarity right up there with the latest group of assholes saying im not a birther but obamas kenyan  the man has been a decent president  not the best surely but hes been  times better than w   his presidency has failed to live up to expectations in my view but thats just an opinion and if the best that can be said is hes not w then you are tacitly agreeing with mehowever this is completely irrelevant to the question of his eligibility is it not  one and the same thing buddyyou cant not be president because a nurse filled in the form wrongeither he was foreign born or not not exactly we know the birth certif was a forgery not only because it fails computer analysis but the items on it for example   the father was listed as african that isnt  and never was a race  in  it would have said negro   the fathers birth place was listed as kenya  in  the area known as kenya since  was called the british protectorate of east africa   the hosp of birth listed on the forged bc was actually  separate hospitals that did not  merge until barry soetosp aka  bho was  years old   gt the fathers birth place was listed as kenya in  the area known as kenya since  was called the british protectorate of east africait was called the british protectorate of east africa from  to  from  to  it was the kenya colony although technically that just referred to the interior with the coastal region being the protectorate of kenya i have a feeling youve copied and pasted that from a chain email or equivalent please read thisin its entirety and then tell us what we know thanks for this  i had seen most of these objections addressed one by one in separate places before but never all in one place its nice to see it all addressed in one spotim not even an obama voter  im just tired of conspiracy theorists troll alert troll alert trump that you why cant you offer an honest rebuttal to those  items  or explanation because your position is weak    and there is no trumphis family surname was drumpf from germany whatever you say donald why cant you offer evidence because your position is fraudulent that mans hair makes him look like a twat whats funnier romneys dad born mexico dad romneys grandfather left united states wanted plural marriage outlawed us in words mitt romneys grandfather loved banging multiple wives than loved united states to be fair thats a tough call bangin multiple women is a tough callmultiple wives thats a man who doesnt like himself very much  the edmunds act of  made polygamy bigamy and cohabitation federal felonies punishable by imprisonment for five years more than  mormons were imprisoned yes the act made living together married or not a federal crimemitts greatgrandfather miles was married to three women when the edmunds act became law the law forced miles to make one of three choices  abandon his wives and children and his faith or  go to prison or  leave their home in arizonamiles moved to mexico in  to escape the religious persecution that threatened not only him but his entire family his son gaskell mitts grandfather was  years old at the time and hardly can be said to have left the united states because he wanted a plural marriage gaskell eventually married once only and had a son george before moving back to the us in  george eventually married once only and had a son mittfor what its worth heres a family history of polygamy president obamas greatgrandfather obama opiyo had five wives including two who were sisters his grandfather hussein onyango had at least four wives one of whom akumu gave birth to the presidents father before fleeing her abusive husband the presidents father was already married when he left kenya to study at the university of hawaii where he married again  gtyes the act made living together married or not a federal crimewhoa after i was married my husband and i shared an apartment with his best friend by the standard of that law we would have been sent to prison or did it only apply to one manmultiple women cohabitation  living together whether the relationship was sexual or not  wasnt a felony but only a misdemeanor sorry for my confusion upon conviction of cohabitation the sentence could be as much as six months in jail and a fine yep you would have potentially been thrown in the hoosegowmany of these laws werent removed from the books until the late s there are quite a few of us who were young adults back then remember that couples could have a very hard time renting an apartment together or getting a hotel room unless you could prove you were married  all strictly legal  this is hilarious thats not quite accurate   his grandfather already had a plural marriage when the law was passed outlawing it and it was being applied ex post facto   which is as anyone can tell you direct violation of the constitutionif they suddenly made being on reddit illegal and were going after people who were on reddit before the law im sure wed all consider canada or mexico too like i said he loved his plural marriage more than he loved the united states not making a judgment its his choice but the fact is clear that picked polygamy over his allegiance to the united states no he picked his wives whom he was already married too and suddenly in legal trouble for because it happened before the law existed   im sorry but any person who would not pick their own family before anything else doesnt deserve to have a family   doesnt an unwillingness to abandon wives he had married before the law actually speak highly of him  so no he picked his marriages you know the one that were already in place before the law over his country  any man who wouldnt do the same should never have married in the first place romney should totally discuss this issue publicly  it would help with independent voters and republicans would put their fingers in their ears and go lalalala coalesce unity blah blah  win win i would also like to bang plural wives where do i sign up  wut magic under pants  no alcohol  whoa whoa whoa  but wait you can become a god of your own planet its quite a conundrum choosing between a harem of wives and no alcohol  not sure which i would pick although it is worth noting that most plural marriages include wives who are in their late teens quite attractive for a  year old man imagine  one wife is an excellent cook another an excellent housekeeper another a great companion and then you have the teenagers for sweet young tight wet exuberant fucking    that got a little dirty hey ive seen the show big love cant say i wasnt jealous is that next on the agenda after we have  to  marriage equality  polygamy  rick santorum would have a heart attack i wouldnt care if it were legal as long as their is no legal or beneficial advantage just equality  ex say insurance through your work covers your spouse but obviously not for free it costs extra if you had  wives everyone still pays equally and benefits equally i think that makes sense  havent hashed that idea out too much   polygamy is still practiced outside of the usa and with in illegally also i am sure it was a joke but mormons dont practice it at all so you wouldnt have to practice that  i saw it on big love dont ruin my dream so mitt romney loves banking multiple countries more than he loves the unites states gtmore than he loved the united statesph why should we love our home country by default if you were born in a polygamist community and your home country persecuted you for your belief would you love iti am playing the devils advocate but also attempting to demonstrate that youre not as openminded as you think you are so  let me get this right  romneys grandparents were born in mexicao  a country that does not allow marriage to more than one person at a time   any additional wives his grandfather had  were not lawfully wedded to him   if his grandfather was not born to the one woman that he married amp had a government issued marriage license with  well  then i would have to say  his father is a mexican and a bastard     ha perhaps we start largescale mitt romney birther conspiracy conspiracy he wasnt born in the us are you kidding me youre so uneducated about this subject thats the spirit you mean mitt did you see the picture this thread is linked to or was that detroit wayne county kenya be sure to use their full names fair is fairbarack hussein obamawillard mittens romney willard was a ratcoincidence we report you decide why doesnt he use his real name  what is he hiding gotta be honest  i think i prefer mittens over hussein you mean obama right wifer mitt romney has many houses throughout the country  why would he have so many  it is only reasonable to suppose that he has one or more wives in each one  as far as i know he has never denied this yeah and i am sure he raped and murdered a girl in   he hasnt denied it right there are so many things he hasnt denied therefore all of them are true why does he refuse to talk about this thats what i want to know the people who care about birthplace are the same people who only care about skin color  they just need an official sounding reason to demand his impeachment for it theres a movement trying to get romney to prove conclusively that he is not a unicorn what whyhe is obviously not a unicorn prove it he looks white it is not going to fly ahh white skin the best defense in all of america polygamy scandal would be more believable  thanks guys for putting this back into the newsyes you should start a largescale mitt romney birther conspiracy  that way both men will be forced to allow the independent media to see their actual original birth certificates not doctored copies of them handed out buy their corrupt campaign managerswhile were at it both men should release their college transcripts and student loan applications so that we can see which one claimed to be a foreigner when they were in college to get financial aid fraudulently obama has released his twice and it was recently reconfirmed to be legit by a republican in hawaii for arizonas elections board what else do you want donald to be a god of course his ego will fill all the universes and especially the wormholes  then  starchild music building  behold the asshole of the universe and he is all alone to be a wanker forever released his what  birth certificate  college transcript  student loan application barack obama has never allowed the state of hawaii to show anyone his original birth certificate although two democrats claim they possess one on file just trust them they sayobama has never released anything his campaign released a pdf file that police investigated and reported was a likely forgery they also reported that his selective service declaration was also a likely forgerygtwhat else do you want donaldid like for barack obama to authorize the corrupt democrats in hawaii to show unbiased news reporters and police his original birth certificate arizona police have been sent to hawaii to view it but the democrats in hawaii wont show it to them citing ridiculous privacy claims which there cant be any alleged privacy claim since obama has already released what he claims they possessi dont trust anyone in government even republicans we should not have to take anyones word for thisshow us the original birth certificate you do realize the birth certificate is a nonissue right regardless if obama shows proof or not  obamas mother was a us citizen  so even if obama wasnt born in the us it would still make him a us citizen and eligible to be president here is the clause from wikipediagtthe weight of legal and historical authority indicates that the term natural born citizen would mean a person who is entitled to us citizenship by birth or at birth either by being born in the united states and under its jurisdiction even those born to alien parents by being born abroad to us citizenparentsjust like how romneys dad who was born in mexico yet was a us citizen simply because his father was a us citizen  george romney went on to run for president   gtyou do realize the birth certificate is a nonissue rightyou do realize the forged birth certificate is an issue right you do realize youre making this bullshit up right  be an adult grow a pair  admit that youre wrong as fuck and move on haha birther you lose well never show you the real birth certificate its a huge conspiracy and youll never figure it out hahahahaaaaa gtshow us the original birth certificateno you are not important enough the adults have already done everything necessary and your petty doubt is nothing but fodder to laugh at lol thats not actually truethe state of hawaii has allowed journalists to look at the original  just one problem click on any of the links in that factcheckorg article related to that one reporters claimstheyre all dead links they lead nowhere no evidence at all that this factcheckorg article is truesecondly that factcheckorg article shows what they purported to be a copy of barack obamas birth certificatebut what they show is different than what barack obama later released and claimed was a copy of his birth certificiatebut which police say is a likely forgery reporters were not shown the original birth certificiate in the offices of the registar of vital statistics in hawaiifinally even the article makes thin claims only two people  in the whole world  claim they have allegedly seen barack obamas original birth certificate and neither is a reporter one is a state health director chiyome fukino the other is the registrar of vital statistics  both of them democratsmy original contention stands not a single reporter has seen barack obamas original birth certificate and cannot verify that it actually existsthe only document that has been released by the obama campaign has been examined by the police and described as a likely forgery along with his selective service declaration or how about we dont  enough with the immature gossip conspiracy shit  seriously you fucking liberals are just as bad as the republicans if not worse this was clearly a joke man yeah guys mocking the downright idiocy of the birther movement is just as immature as the birther movement itselfyou know except for that whole thing where it isnt i waiting conclusive proof mitt romney unicorn hes clearly a robot hes a robot unicorn he hides that horn well does he showing his horn is ungodly behaviour like homosexuality or oh wait hes mormon its a good thing romney has yet to ask for the birth certificate  and point is romney obama muslim born kenya youre attacking romney what stupid conservatives said unfair irrational donald trump isnt just any stupid conservative hes someone romney is heavily using to do robocalls and share a stage with except that a lot of conservatives think thats a mistake not romney evidently and romney released his own birth certificate for no other reason than as a dog whistle to the birthers i want to see trumps certificate for his hair just cause someone supports you does not necessarily mean you support them you dont get on stage with someone shake hands and talk the issues on the same line and then walk off stage and get to call not my friend not my politics not my flock  no one is going to accept those kinds of playground rules but palling around and campaigning with them hip to hip sure does gtsome stupid conservativesyoure talking about of the republican base  and romney has official campaign surrogates still running around talking about how obama wasnt born in the united states citation  of republican voters believe that obama isnt an american  this is from huffington post but the poll is from public policy no i want a citation that says that official romney campaign personnel are going around propping up the birther stuff arizonas secretary of state ken bennett threatened to leave obama off the ballot if he didnt produce his birth certificate  hes also cochair of romneys arizona campaign romneys cochairman of his campaign tried to have obama removed from the ballot in arizona  romney is clearly testing the waters of birtherism the very act of releasing his birth certificate is a nod to the conspiracy nuts   romneys birth certificate is obviously faked yet romney is pandering to said stupid conservatives if they are his sheep he needs to take at least some responsibility for them arizonas secretary of state ken bennett threatened to leave obama off the ballot if he didnt produce his birth certificate  hes also cochair of romneys arizona campaign i honestly dont think this is an attack on romney its an attack on the idiots who despite the evidence and none of their own still think obama wasnt born in the united states i dont think anyone is honestly trying to stop romney from running  the idea that mitt is not valid to be president is a parody of real birthers who claim obama isnt eligible because of his foreign born father  no one is calming romney is publicly a birther  this isnt so much an attack on romney as it is an attack on birtherism gtwillard mitt romney certificate says born detroit march  you what happened  roswelli demand romney provide earth certificate the real one romneyet  oh my god i got chills im white registered republican ive issue with obamas background my cats hand keep wet food subsidies i ideologically against i too have experienced this daily request for wet food subsidies which i am only ideologically against before  am cat people are weird  toxoplasmosis i never feed my cats in the morning thats a recipe for being woken up before you want to be they only ever get fed at night that also helps them to be more torpid when im trying to sleep this title completely misleading romney born us soil us citizen matter where father born the problem with obama believed born kenya their parents with it so foreign os obama inaccurate whether there truth all actually its not inaccurate romney has just as much proof that he was born in the us as obama does both of their fathers werent born in the united states but their mothers were romney is just as foreign as obama is not at all gt both of their fathers werent born in the united states but their mothers were romney is just as foreign as obama isexcept obamas dad is an actual kenyan born in kenya to kenyansmitts dad was just born in mexico to americans who had moved to mexico to escape prosecution in the us for polygamynot that any of it matters because i get that the whole mexicanunicorn thing is just a satirical response to birtherism but please dont actually believe that romney is just as foreign as obama especially when it comes to how birthers will perceive them im not using foreign the same way you are and in all honesty if you arent native american youre foreign too if you are born in the us live in the us most of your life i dont consider you foreign youre american  most americans are native americans we were born here the precolumbian inhabitants of north and south america and their descendants  theyre all descended from people who emigrated from asia i think most people agree when we are dealing with timescales on the order of thousands of years you are native  this was long enough for people to differentiate from asians enough that the two dont even look similar  except for the inuit gtbut please dont actually believe that romney is just as foreign as obama especially when it comes to how birthers will perceive themwhy not mitts family absconded from americas ban on polygamy turned their back on this great country and moved to mexico as soon as they decided to leave this country they branded themselves unamerican by every definition of the tea party and is therefore foreignerswe shouldnt believe that mitt is just as foreign as obama but by birther logic they should mitts grandparents didnt move to mexico to escape persecution  one ok two of his greatgrandparents did apostrophes im trying to be respectful to both sides but come on george romney his father was working for an automative group at the time of romneys birth in detroit and well before it there is less than a year discrepancy between obamas family in kenya and the united states when obama was born yet my point being it doesnt matter if both of their parents were born in iraq the title is still inaccurate read your amendments and citizenship rights  what do you suggest i read specifically obama meets every metric as does romney they are both eligible to run for president apparently youre not understanding what im trying to say this title specifically says his father was born in mexico and all im saying is who cares the reason the legitimacy of obamas birth is questioned is due to his families whereabouts at the time of his birth there is a short window of time and discrepancies unlike romney from his families time in kenya to his birth in the united states that caused many people to question it do i believe obama was born in the united states sure do i believe it should at least be looked into yes which i feel it already has adequately been done  i get it i just think its worthless nonsense people can speculate and question whatever they want but the fact of the matter is hawaii certifies obama as being born here thats the end of the story obama and romney share this fact as well as having foreign born fathers thats all the headline is saying too  gt the reason the legitimacy of obamas birth is questioned is due to his families whereabouts at the time of his birththe reason the legitimacy of obamas birth is questioned is due to his foreignsounding name and the color of his skin period there is no reasonable basis whatsoever to think he was born elsewhere and its well established that his father had lived in hawaii for a month short of two years already by the time he was born the only reason this ever became a thing was rightwing crazies wanting to paint him as other  i mean his own paternal grandmother said she witnessed his live birth in a kenyan hospital i would believe thats a good enough reason to look into it many birthers such as pennsylvania attorney phil berg allege that obama was born in kenya and that his kenyan grandmother is on tape saying that she was present at his birth thereyet the tape circulated on the internet doesnt actually say that  and the full tape actually contradicts iton the tape the woman thought to be sarah obama is prodded by a berg ally whos a selfdescribed bishop from the us to affirm that obama was born in kenyawas she present when he was born in kenya bishop ron mcrae asks in the taped phone callshe says yes she was she was present when obama was born says the voice of translatorthe tape ends abruptlydespite bergs assertions the response didnt actually confirm a birth in kenya moreover a longer version of the tape shows the elder obama decidedly denying a kenyan birth immediately after the first tape was cut offi would like to go by the place the hospital where he was born can you tell me where he was born was he born in mombasa mcrae is heard askingobama was not born in mombasa he was born in america the translator says after talking to the womani thought he was born in kenya mcrae asks againhe was born in america not in mombasa says the response another response later says obama in hawaii hawaii she says he was born in hawaii the title is a parody of what real birthers believe its not serious the birthers went through a chain of arguments he was born in kenya show us the birth certificate we need to see the long form birth certificate the one you showed us isnt good enough well ok his dad was born in kenya and had uk citizenship at the time of obamas birth and we all know that only naturallyborn citizens of the us can be president since the constitution doesnt provide a definition well just say naturallyborn citizen means you were born in the us and both of your parents were too so youre saying hes an anchor baby never let logic get in the way of a good dig at the otherside can we agree going thing i completely agree by bringing up things like this all people liberals democrats nonbirthers are doing is making themselves look as ignorant and spiteful as the people who spread the terrible rumors about obama even if they are doing it ironicallythere are plenty of legitimate issues to bring up lets not distract from them with this childish nonsense i would love to say nothen i think of the last  years of utter ridiculousness that has spewed forth from mitts party and i just cant help but wonder why a unicorn would run for president  but hes white oh my god karen you cant just go around asking people why theyre white im sorry i called you a gaptoothed bitch its not your fault youre so gaptoothed karen why would you do that karen why did you do that i see what you did jane you ignorant slut aside birth place issue why actual fuck we listening trump election politics general he runs casinos hotels its ego forced take part accepted trump trump trump has to vent his ego every so often lest it come out the other end and no one wants that with the ratings failures of his tv show this is his one last avenue to keep his name in the mediaand the media being the media is all too happy to promote famous people saying whatever the shit they want because it brings in more viewers than random noncelebrities regardless of how educated or logical they areits america celebrity sells intelligence is boring as shit and ridiculed for the same reason we listen to sarah palin or bristol palin or the kardashians i think its money as illustrated by this great phototrump

just do what works along with the base and elderly getting obama giving their tax dollars to welfare queens driving cadillacs and looting medicare to give illegal brown drug dealers free health care all delivered with unlimited ad money this is not unlike  another referendum on the overall intelligence of the us independent voter the only way this isnt depressing is if romney gets crushed look for the group think weighted polling to give romney a    point bounce from the convention we declared victory way too soon as the unlimited ad budget will wash away the ryan budget and romneys past far right positions the dems should talk about nothing but romneys taxes and ryans budget the crazy antiwoman stuff isnt going to resonate with the mushy middle it just sounds like two sides of the culture war to them especially once romney starts playing himself as above it all see above hes gonna run away from the ryan budget and ryans going to help im not running for president mitt is and hes just a reasonable businessman hes going to run away from the crazy far right culture war stuff im just a reasonable businessman i  and many  saw this coming well now wring our hands about how dishonest the whole act is in our minority echo chamber on the web and in the media can we do anything about it id guess obama etc  saw this coming so heres hoping they have a plan maybe this qualifies as concern trolling but im too depressed about it to care i get emails asking for  when adelson has a billion dollars on the table dont think otherwise maybe a ground game can beat back the

themthat sound who supports abortionwith contraception all believed people use it that contradict viewpoints just there mandate include birthcontrol health insurance hes contraception altogetheri fan obama i want win election based lies misinformationeditmoreover we supporting fact completely unequivocally rebuked statements todd akin thats clearly obvious thing its candidates offering maximum condemnation what said gttwo lives at steaksounds tasty oh god how amateur of me iama request a child butcher did you say steak thanks for degrading thoughtful political discourse into shitty wordplayi come to rpolitics to laugh not to think i was looking through the comments to make sure at least someone had said this yeah i read some quotes from over his career and they seemed to match i was confused as to what the controversy was i find the man revolting but distorting facts is not how id like to bring him down  id literally be applauding right now if i didnt think itd be really confusing to the people next to meim glad that some people are still willing to prize their honor and integrity above their political ideals maybe not any of our candidates but at least some people no controversy as you noted just kos sensationalizing as always he thrives off of gaffes and when he cant find one he makes one up i think its important to remember that romney and his campaign continues using a line that has been proven false by multiple sources saying obama is cutting m from medicaide is rated halftrueand not because the affordable care act cuts any money the m is a cost savings not a benefit reduction medicare costs will increase over that year period even with the m savings the half truth according to politifact gt in fact the law uses a number of measures to try to reduce the rapid growth of future medicare spending those savings are then used to offset costs created by the law  especially coverage for the uninsured  so that the overall law doesnt add to the deficit romney and his campaign continue to use this line of obama cutting medicare which is false flatout false im not sure why this statement was half true as the truth is that its a m cost savings but thats politifacts rating so hey at any rate if a politician and a campaign continue to mislead people so blatantly without being held accountable by the media andor the people it  should be noted and counted against them i dont think the media has done a good job in the past or any time recently in calling people out on their bullshit especially when its so obvious and has been talked about so much as the obama cutting medicare line has been i think obama cuts medicare should be made into a mock headline alongside romney supports governmentfunded abortion the second headline would actually be true in that case but would be equally sensational i agree with your last point whether or not what he says about medicare is true doesnt mean that people can sell this video as romney flip flops on abortion and birth control if people are going to criticise this video they should focus on his policies and whether he speaks the truth while i wanted to focus on the medicare line i also know that romney has taken many different positions on issues which fluctuate over time and not always in one direction he definitely has been more liberal on abortion and birth control both in speech and policy and later has become less liberal on those issues to varying degrees seemingly based on whether its politically advantageous to him at that time so i think thats a fair thing to point out does this have anything to do with the article i guess youre just replying to the video not the article why are you posting this here then im replying directly to a comment specifically thisgti am a fan of obama but i dont want him to win the election based on lies and misinformation i took issue with the lies and misinformation part because it seems such a part of the romney campaign so i replied to that comment directly i dont see why you took issue with the lies and misinformation part his point was that this article contains lies and misinformation and that people who support obama shouldnt resort to this to win even if romney does calling romney out on lies is also good but the article doesnt talk about any of his actual lies and misinformation mostly i think the medicare line is powerful and totally disingenuous and wanted to offer my thoughts about that specific statement sometimes its good for a voice to offer their thoughts about one facet of a multifaceted discussion halftrue is politics is better than average id say   as i said i dont think characterizing that statement as half true is accurate its like saying that your spending less on food because youre better able to prepare it for yourself and save money is equal to slashing your food budgeti think the statement should have been mostly false at best yep plus romneycare does provide abortions but its due to a  court ruling in massachusetts not because romney wanted it there i agree with you this title is extremely misleading romney clearly hasnt flipped and turned prochoiceunfortunately thats my problem with the guy he gets asked about abortion because the democrats are attacking him on the issue of womens right to choose and he skirts around the answer he clearly wants to take away that choice from women and heres why i believe that he chose ryan to be his running mate and ryan helped to coauthor akins crazy attempt to define legitimate raperyan believes the same crap that akin said and romney is in bed with ryan that tells you everything you need to know about romneys stance on womens rights legitimate question howwhen did ryan coauthor akins statements  ryan was one of admittedly many republicans who cosponsored house resolution  which was an attempt to limit federal funding for abortions and had a lot of language which defined what is legitimate rape to be clear im not saying that ryan believes that the body has a way of shutting down in cases of legitimate rape but he certainly believes that getting violently abused is no excuse for an abortion and he has voted for or cosponsored every hardcore piece of abortion legislation that akin wrote  thanks for the info im still catching up when it comes to knowledge about ryan no problem word of warning i dont actually live in the us and the majority of my information on ryan comes from reddit which has a well acknowledged left bias or other headline newsalso in the interest of full disclosure i have a left of centre view on abortion so its always good to do additional research and assume everybody is lying to you to further their own goals d gt ryan believes the same crap that akin saidplease back this up with a statement from ryan  where has he ever said that rape doesnt result in conception does this work for you note im using business insider because it is a little less left wing crazy  where does that claim that ryan said that rape doesnt result in conception  in fact id say that making a law that excuses rape from antiabortion laws means that you recognize that you could need an abortion after getting raped you are right ryan has never been caught saying that rape doesnt result in conception he might even just about trust science enough to know that rape often does lead to conceptionbut ryan also absolutely believes that not all rape is rape and hes helped to sponsor resolutions which would deny abortions to women is were illegitimately rapedwhen it comes to rape akin believes that some women cant actually tell the difference between rape and consensual sex so he needs to define it explicitly himself  this is a view that ryan shares and is the same crap that i was previously referring toim not sure if you are a prolifer blindly backing ryan because you hate obama or just trolling but i dont see how you could not recognize ryan and akin as being the same the only difference is that akin got caught saying something stupid enough to become a scapegoat gt but ryan also absolutely believes that not all rape is rapesourcegt  hes helped to sponsor resolutions which would deny abortions to women is were illegitimately rapedsourceand if youre wondering yes im claiming youre full of shit  while he has proposed legislation that required the exception be forcible rape thats not saying its legitimate rape and other rape isnt legitimate its just saying that they are different and if you dont think they are different then what the hell are you looking atgt when it comes to rape akin believes that some women cant actually tell the difference between rape and consensual sex so he needs to define it explicitly himselfone akin is an idiot most republicans at this point have come out against him because hes an idiottwo nobody has said that women cant tell the difference between rape and consensual sexnobody ever at all  they are saying that there is a difference between types of rape and once again if you cant see that then youre being blinded by your biasesgt i dont see how you could not recognize ryan and akin as being the samebecause theyre not and anyone that says they are is so fucking biased that they arent a reliable source for any conversation in this subject  you are so damned determined to find fault that you look at shit that isnt true and claim it is  theres so many problems with romney and ryan its not even funny yet you attack them for something they dont support or say thats fucking bullshit  attack their stances themselves dont make up shit just because you hate them  frankly both parties are failing miserably this election and thats why im voting for johnson but just because they have problems doesnt mean you should make stuff up and lie to make them worse than they are you know whatim actually tempted to agree with you im pro choice on abortion so im guilty of being biased against ryan especially because he always comes across as a smug motherfcker id just like to hitbut i went back and reread everything hr has language for forciblerape rather than legitimaterapei happen to think that it by defining different types of rape and only acknowledging some forms of rape you are fairly clearly defining what is and is not legitimate rape gun to your head check thats rape knife check  rape you screamed for an hour afterwards and had to be sewn back up   rape noone heard you scream and you only had a couple of bruises sorry no evidence you were raped roofied well if you arent struggling then its not violent enough no abortion for yousee that list is bullshit if its rape then its rape its always forcible it doesnt have to be violentthe reason ive changed my mind is that ive decided i actually respect akin and ryan on abortion more than i do more of the republican party and heres whymost republicans say they are against abortions because life begins at conception and therefor abortion is murder ok i dont agree with you but ill admit that i can understand that point of viewnow as far as people like ryan are concerned thats the end of the story murder is bad so abortions are bad then you get the rest of the republican party who want to go back and say that its ok for rape or incest cases but how does that make any sense abortions are murder unless you were raped at which point the fetus is no longer a person or do we still think that the fetus is a small person with a sole and just no longer care does that mean that i can go around killing adults who were born from rape or incestryan is the only sane oh dear god that feels weird to say person on the party all these moderate points on abortion are bs and i can see why akin got confused and goofed remember the party line is that a fetus is alive at conception and its a sin to kill the fetus unless there was rape or incest now that fetus isnt a living sole after all the party line sounds a lot like what akin saida fetus is alive with a sole at conception except in rape cases where the body apparently prevents the sole from appearing so we are allowed to kill the fetus presumably children of rape must get their soles later so they become people again its seems a bit lazy to respond to a comment using words that arent your ownbut occasionally they serve as a welcomed placeholder  american bob flipped kinda weird that this side seems to be more moral than the moral majority  its the ends justify the means for them  so hypocritical does romneycare include birthcontrol it isnt mandatedi thought the big fuss earlier this year was to ban birthcontrol in obamacare not just to make it optional maybe but romney has specifically stated that hes against health mandates on a federal level anything on a state level is aok the big fuss was about obamacare mandating that religious employers provide birth control the religious employers wanted an exemption because they claimed providing birth control or even insurance that covered birth control would have violated the tenets of their religionsromney said that he believes people have the right to use birth control  this is not the same thing theres a big difference between a requirement that your employer pay for it and your right to use it the republicans or at least most republicans werent trying to ban birth control or to remove it from obamacare  they just wanted an exemption for religious employers  gttheres a big difference between a requirement that your employer pay for it and your right to use itthats stupid it is still just your right to use it it is still the decision of the employee to use them if your employees choose not to use birth control its not as if the insurance provider will force them to use it the only thing the federal mandate gives is choice otherwise those employers would technically be discriminating against those who would like to use birth control its not stupid they are two completely different things saying i believe you have the right to drink coffee and i believe all employers should be forced to provide coffee are two totally different things people can still get birth control without their employers providing insurance that covers it you still have the choice to use it regardless of your insurance  your employer cant fire you for taking it eithergt  those employers would technically be discriminating well discrimination is treating people different so in this instance an employer is not discriminating by refusing to provide insurance that covers birth control they are treating everybody exactly the same   giving bc to nobody my point was only that mitt romney didnt say he agreed with obamas mandate that religious employers provide bc  they are talking about two different things  gtpeople can still get birth control without their employers providing insurance that covers it thats like saying you still have the choice to vote but you need to buy a voter idgtthey are treating everybody exactly the same  giving bc to nobodythats like saying banning gay marriage is not discriminating that making marriage between a male and a female is not discriminating because everyone can marry the opposite sexregardless of whether a federal mandate requires employers to provide health insurance w birth control employers not providing health insurance w birth control is discriminating by satisfying one groups fears and beliefs that no one should use birth control at the expense of others nothing wrong with using birth control again the mandate does not require employers to provide health insurance that requires the use of birth control which would be discrimination against those who dont want to use ityou need to apply to appropriate contextdiscriminating gt neutral gt discriminating    no one can use birth control gt it doesnt matter if anyone uses it gt everyone must use birth controlinsurance must cover birth control  you must use birth controlthe whole issue has nothing to do with religious rights and all to do with  business owners excuse for cost savings and bigotry in forcing ones beliefs on others believing otherwise is naivewhat they are asking for is the right to discriminate against others with their own beliefs that no one should use birth control your rights are limited to yourself you dont want to use birth control and cannot be applied to others they can use birth control if they want if i dont want to pay for insurance that provides birth control is a valid argument then the argument i dont want to pay for insurance that insures people who dont use birth control is also valid gt thats like saying you still have the choice to vote but you need to buy a voter idno its like saying you have the right to bear arms under the second amendment  that doesnt mean the government or your employer is required to give you one gt thats like saying banning gay marriage is not discriminatingthats a laughable conclusion they are two completely distinct things first of all marriage is a fundamental right under the constitution access to birth control is a fundamental right under the constitution you are opening up a completely new can of worms here discrimination is unequal treatment period discrimination is not picking one viewpoint over another its not validating one group while ignoring the other its treating one group differently than the other  and no this is not the same as doing what one group wants and not doing what another group wants it would be discriminatory for employers to say well provide birth control to everyone who we see in church on sunday but not you other hedonists but thats not what happenednot to mention that the loosest definition of discrimination which still doesnt apply here isnt the same thing as illegal discrimination  gt you need to apply to appropriate contextseriously you are jumbling up like  different arguments here its hard to even tell if you are talking about the government or employers in fact the neutral in your example is exactly what the employers are doing they dont give a shit if you take bc and couldnt fire you if they did they just dont want to provide it to yougt cost savingswrong again its cheaper to provide birth control than to pay for the pregnancies gt  forcing ones beliefs on otherswell there im pretty sure your opponent would agree you are forcing your beliefs onto them they never stood in the way of their employees taking birth control and now you are saying the government should force them to violate the tenets of their religion gt what they are asking for is the right to discriminate against others with their own beliefs that no one should use birth controlonce again you completely ignore the point of the argument employers have a right under the first amendment to practice their religion if that means not providing birth control then thats what it means the government could no more force them to provide birth control then they could force them to stop baptizing kids or force them to stay home on sundays you are the one forcing your beliefs onto others gt your rights are limited to yourself you dont want to use birth control and cannot be applied to others they can use birth control if they wantlets reframe this your rights are limited to yourself you want to use birth control and cannot be applied to others they dont want to provide it to youthe funny thing is that i happen to agree that allowing a religious exemption is bad  you are just doing such a terrible job defending my position gtfirst of all marriage is a fundamental right under the constitutionthats why people cant marry the same sex uh what lets go back in time the argument made was everyone can marry the same race this failed because race was protected from discrimination maybe access to birth control isnt protected from discrimination but it is still discriminationand marriage isnt even mentioned in the constitutiongtthey dont give a shit if you take bc and couldnt fire you if they did they just dont want to provide it to youactually what theyre saying is they give a lot of shit about whether you take bc but we all know they really just care about their bottom line because covering bc may probably does raise their insurance ratesgtwrong again its cheaper to provide birth control than to pay for the pregnanciesthat assumes providing bc means people take them id say on average it isnt going to reduce the number of pregnancies the insurance plan covers each year people who dont use bc wont use it people who will use it will spend their own  to use it and its quite expensive without insurance then the others would be stuck with condoms and other less effective methodsgtemployers have a right under the first amendment to practice their religion if that means not providing birth control then thats what it meansemployers are not providing anything the health insurance is not something that employers are providing employers are only providing the group negotiating power of their employees so that employees can get favorable rates for insurance claims are typically not paid out by employers unless they run their own health insurance poolgtthe funny thing is that i happen to agree that allowing a religious exemption is badmy point is that it is that by calling it a religious exemption you have already given them their win if not before he done it he happened again to done did it already the problem is not weather he sounded good or not  the problem is that though he may be espousing fairly progressive ideas in this video his platform has consistently been the opposite of this before now   yes but he and paul ryan have taken some pretty extreme stances on contraception and chris wallace didnt bring up any of themnothing he said contradicted what he was campaigning on because he wasnt even fucking asked about what hes campaigning on he was given this softball question and wallace let him get away with murder romneys stance on contraception as far as everything ive read is that there shouldnt be a mandate that private health insurance or the government must cover contraception  how is this particularly extreme  its not saying the private companies cant cover it nor is he saying that it shouldnt be allowed at all because thats sexual discrimination many women need birth control for serious health issues a company shouldnt be able to claim religious freedom in denying women a medical necessityryans views are much more extreme than that i dont believe that theres anything in their proposals that limits the use of contraceptive medicine for nonbirth control medically necessary uses its just like viagra not saying that they are the same as far as what they do but i mean how its covered its not covered for use to allow people to have sex as an old man but it is covered when used to treat important health issues lol what important health issues you mean erectile dysfunction also known as the inability of old men to have sexalso their proposal is to allow companies not to cover birth control theres nothing in their proposals that makes an exception for important health issues as you call them so if a company wants to deny a woman birth control for any reason so long as they cite religious reasons they are free to do so under the republicans and romneys proposal gt sildenafil revatio is used to improve the ability to exercise in people with pulmonary arterial hypertension pah high blood pressure in the vessels carrying blood to the lungs causing shortness of breath dizziness and tirednessgt sildenafil has been shown to be useful for the prevention and treatment of highaltitude pulmonary edema associated with altitude sickness such as that suffered by mountain climberswhile not marketed as viagra its the same drug and same delivery system  and when a larger dosage is needed they switch to viagra as revatio isnt packaged in a larger dosagegt so if a company wants to deny a woman birth control for any reason so long as they cite religious reasons they are free to do sono theyre not  they arent free to deny a woman anything but free birth control they cant deny her all birth control in any way  in addition the usage of contraceptive drugs in medically necessary cases that arent birth control isnt birth control  this isnt restrictedso you dont seem to know what youre talking about when it comes to drugs or legislation show me where in that legislation the republicans make an exception for contraceptive drugs in medically necessary casesi admit i was way off on the viagra thing though is point respecting dailykos the way article written who agree wouldnt read sentence  this liberal circlejerking finestdont flame im liberal fairly flaming that until kos offer content without heavy handed unprofessional biasrevealing interjections ummmm really worse regarded than adlaced pile lib opeds this journalism from the dailykos about pagegtmarkos moulitsas zniga is founder and publisher of daily kos the largest progressive community blog in the united states so yeah i think they are pretty unapologetic about being biased  bias isnt necessarily a bad thing as long as you are honest about it   its not their bias its their winking at it if all of our media becomes selfconsciously partisan like this then people know whether they agree before they even start reading thy should at least give a chance that a non partisan reader could mistake this for reporting i dont think they have a partisan bias so much as an ideological bias  there are progressive republicans admittedly not many just as there are conservative democrats   i dont care what their bias is im bothered by how plainly they state their bias whats the point of writing for a preselected audiencebefore you say it the answer is ad revenue i actually find their frankness to be refreshing compared to most news sources who claim to be unbiased while being anything but gtwhats the point of writing for a preselected audience build support for your ideology  address criticisms from other competing ideologies  there are plenty of reasons   you dont build support for your ideology or address criticisms from competing ideologies by writing to your base the way they do practically everyone who reads dailykos is already ultraliberal its designed to appeal to that demographic and with its incredibly dismissive attitude to no one elseactivism is a better answer they make sure that their demographic is aware of every relevant piece of news or nonnews with the proper spin and applicable talking points ready for the repeating trolls trolling trolls the problem is it doesnt give you a leg to stand on if you accuse people of fox for being biased and then go and do it yourself it is one thing to be biased and trying to work at erradicating your biases but not to be proud of your biases the only issue i have with fox newss bias is that they dont admit it exists  they pretend to be unbiased arbitrators  i have no problem with conservatives having their own media so long as they label it as such   unilateral disarmament how does it work its a bad thing if youre looking for actual facts that reflect reality instead of just the facts that support a particular persons point of view not sure what this means facts do not change the spin around the facts can change but if i say for instance quote a statistic about taxes and then go on to make a comment about the gop relating to taxes because they tend to lie and i want to prove their lies false or something along those lines is that being biased is that liberal circlejerking i understand it can and does happen but it seems to me any article that puts forth the facts and then an opinion about them that is against the gop is labeled as a having a liberal bias do we really want the media to be just a dems say this the republicans say that we wont tell you who is lying the concern is that someone with a bias will cherrypick the facts that make their position look correct or even straight up misrepresent the facts because their goal is to convince you of their position not to inform you of the truth you do want the media to do fact checking but the truth should be evident from those facts  not presented as an opinion when they present it as peterfalls said with such childish interjections it had better be setting off all of your alarm bells that they are probably not being honest with you as a community we should not accept such unprofessional journalism as a source of facts except not enough people actually read dry objective political essays or cfr would be booming with usersits not  opeds are better for discussions with the general public imho even if they are inflammatory   what is left out of an article can be as important as what is included romneys own words were criticized in the article what was left out im with you i think dailykos is worthless it isnt because of their bias which i agree with it is because it is not journalism it is made up of piss poor opinion pieces and if they ever do report facts the facts are just taken from an actual news sourcecut out the middle man i dont need my opinions spoon fed to me like gerber mmmmm mushed carrots is anyone past the point of respecting rpolitics i dont see why you whiny pissants that complain about this subreddit come here if it gives you entertainment thats fine but it is disingenuous to complain about something that you actively enjoy why do we come here because it helps break up the circle jerk and it exposes both sides of the argument and fixes some of the bias headlines we all know that this site is a bunch of liberal teenagers and early  somethings that get excited over everything the republicans do stupidly i hope anyone with any sense of journalism cringes at their lack of professionalism i dont need to be told the news as if i were a yearold girl like ummm okay aaaaaaaand thats why mitt romney is like a lying jerk gt this is liberal circlejerking at its finestnot empty quoting this article is terrible i just skimmed through for the quotes thank you i find both thinkprogress and daily kos to be ridoculously sensationalist tp wrongly interprets a lot of things and dk can be very unprofessional i stick to the huffpo for the liberal view why are people shocked to learn that journalism is biased  was there some magical time in history when journalism was utterly unbiased  news has always been the product of the people that write it  news is a discussion about current events and the people who discuss it have an opinion  to think otherwise is foolish and a little naive   i see no ads on this website as i browse with with adblock of course late to the game here but i am under the impression that dailykos is a dairy based site and not an attempt at being a news organisation  gtanyone who didnt already agree wouldnt read past sentence i literally read one sentence looked at the website and closed the tab totally agree im a liberal too but i found this article very annoying and polarizing  gt the way this article is written anyone who didnt already agree wouldnt read past sentence do you know what struck me about how this article begins it begins with  minutes of uncut video from a source that opposes their political point of view i know some pretty rightwing folks on facebook and sometimes ill read the conservative blog posts they link to i dont remember any of those sites doing anything similar any video they have of president obama will be a short sound bite edited so you might misconstrue what hes trying to say  kos is completely unprofessional especially in their writing th graders in an ap english class speak with more academic language than these people write with disgraceful your right do you have any nonpartisan websites we can read theres a difference between being partisan and being blatantly partisan nytimes comes to mind being an extension of the bush admin war department comes to mind when thinking about the ny times the old grey lady has seen better days better days so point out where its wrong instead of whining about the tone id be glad to theyre pretending that the ideology of federalism doesnt exist simply because they dont agree with it its not about factual or fictional right or wrong its because its unnecessary to add the flair vilifying the other side making them into props that can be wheeled out for a quick laugh it all serves to detach thought from politics and attach emotion to it it doesnt matter whether dailykos runs a true story or a false one because these unsubtle markers feed you all that you need to feel that mitt romneys a jerkif you read a kos post on rpolitics get pissed off at romney and then read an unassailable refutation in the comments does your anger at romney go away thats because the anger isnt intellectual yeah so maybe romney didnt actually insert outrage here but i feel like he would if he ever had the chance what a douchei do it too its hard not to were trained in so many strange ways well course its monday thats monday position itll change friday hes already etchasketching his way towards the center id like to see a commercial where they put mitt quotes on an etchasketch shake it blank and replace it with contradicting quotes they need to hit him hard on the flipflopping say whatever it takes to get elected crap that he says bush ii managed to win his second term by branding his opponent a waffler that couldnt make a decision  how about the full michael bay treatment not enough explosions  this is amazing  false etchasketches have no center what day are the election on might be nice to figure out what his position will be when it comes time to vote  tuesday americas got talent is on that night so no one is really paying attention wonder what is the voting demographic of that shows viewers  people without any conception of talent obviously thats just for republicans democrats vote on wednesday this time sorry did you say fridayi give it tuesday pm latest for his next flip to the flop est or pdt depends he might just flop back at both pm time zones yea when you ask mitt what position he has on something he can say all of themits like that joke i heard recentlya conservative a moderate and a tea partier walks into a bar and the bartender sayshi mitt mitt doesnt drink alcohol though let me try fixing it a conservative a moderate and a tea partier walks into a coffee shop and the barista sayshi mitt thatll work and make sure it is a coffee shop where the trees are all the right heights subtle rush quote squint  why why standard and daylight ya never know with mitt lol hmmm yeahimma gunna need you to change your position on saturdayand sunday too hmmm yeahgreeeat  i am sorry you are so totally wrong  mittens will change his position by tomorrow if not sooner  he is fundamentally unable to maintain a single coherent position on any issue what so ever for more than  hours tops  the mans short term memory is simply nonexistant or at least appears to be you must be right there even giving odds on  in vegas so only obama is allowed to have evolving views big difference between evolving and revolving theres a difference between saying i used to think a but now i realized that b and saying you believe a then the next day b and you never believed a in the first place then the next day a again and all that about b is just propaganda from the other side and the following day b again logic by mitt romneyi was considering a red corvette then considered the blue corvettei think i will go with the yellow laptop computer how is it different in the first case you admit you were wrong and change your position accordinglyin the second case you say whatever you need to say to gain the approval of your current audience what proof do you have that obama is only a part of the first case he may very well be pandering but at least he acknowledges he made a shift none but in the particular case youre talking about when you cite the expression evolving views you are talking about a specific case he has been pretty consistent burden of proof is on you my friend what other issues has obama flip flopped on what other issues has he flip flopped on continuously as someone else mentioned evolve vs revolve here here are a couple voted against increasing the debt limit then supported raising it campaigned against the bush tax cuts then extended all of them promised to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term then proposed trillion dollar deficits vowed the unemployment rate would be below  if his stimulus was passed but then it broke  promised shovel ready jobs then admitted they werent shovel ready said if you like your health plan you can keep it but then threw seniors off medicare plus and employers are now saying theyll dump people onto the public exchange promised to have health care negotiations on live tv but then reversed himself indicated bush violated the constitution then carried out warrantless wiretaps indefinite detentions secret renditions quadrupled drone attacks and kept guantanamo bay open  voted against the patriot act but then supported its extension said lobbyists wouldnt work in the white house then gave them waivers to work there vowed to take public financing for his  campaign then refused public financing when he realized he would receive more money without it why should anyone bother trying to explain to you what you have already demonstrated you are too stupid to grasp when mitt romney birth control than making free in debate asked why state would want outlaw birth control would dumb when asked by mike huckabee if he would have signed a personhood amendment to the massachusetts constitution he said absolutely if a fertilized egg has the rights of a person that outlaws many forms of birth control which forms of birth control act against fertilized eggs most hormonal birth control acts in two ways first by preventing ovulation then by preventing egg implantation if a egg gets fertilized it still never implants and the fertilized egg is aborted before it ever implants and starts to divideedit this isnt my viewpoint im just trying to explain mike huckabees thought process by this logic a miscarriages happen at an alarming rate many times as many eggs that are fertilized dont implant and its all natural  thats not a miscarriage just as what youve described isnt an abortion yep i agree with you but mike huckabees wouldnt huckabees a fundamentalist  hes more conservative than ryan yet not as intelligent and not as consistent  i wish he would just go back to his church and preach to his little congregation being opposed to many forms of birth control does not mean you are opposed to birth control in general  vegetarians are opposed to meat but it doesnt mean theyre opposed to eating they are opposed to happiness though edit please dont downvote this guy hes asking a legitimate question that should be answeredits mainly the gops stance on birth control and abortion they dont want it to be covered by insurance though there are some gop calling for an outright ban on it though i doubt that will ever happen also here is some legislation on birth control and contraception he was supporting thanks to user wallyanti its not that they dont want it covered by insurance its that they dont want organizations who are morally opposed contraception to it to be mandated to provide it through their insurance thanks gtrepublicans including mitt recognize use contraceptives is why party complete total meltdown trying block coverage contraception earlier yeardid author article stroke theres difference use contraceptives requirement coverage contraceptives i am not sure i agree with you that there is a difference contraceptives is considered part of preventative medical care so there is no reason why it shouldnt be included in regular insurance coverage it saves the insurance companies a ton of money as well as is recommended by every single doctor for  percent of women i kind of get the point that the right to be able to use them at all is different from the right to have insurance cover them is slightly a different conversation the issuse the gop has with birth control was clearly not about insurance companies or corporations and organizations being forced to cover birth control it was about organizations crying that the insurance company was covering birth control and their religion says no to that or whatever the excuse was they came up with at the time because remember insurance companies came forward and said if you assholes are going to throw a religious fit about this your dumb because we are paying for it because it saves us and in turn you money fucking idiots and the gop came back and still said no so it was not about organizations being forces to pay money more money then before for birth control because insurance companies said we will pay for it out of our pockets it was about wanting to control women not money for once  what trainofthought was trying to say is that the article falsely makes the jump from romney not wanting free contraceptives to romney doesnt like contraceptives which has never been his position gt so it was not about organizations being forces to pay money more money then before for birth control because insurance companies said we will pay for it out of our pocketssome people for whatever ideological reason ill never understand are morally opposed to contraception  im willing to grant them the freedom to feel this way even if it costs their organization more money to provide health insurance  im much less willing to say that thats ok if it has an effect on public health especially of employees like say the accountant at a hospital that operates in a secular way even though it is run by a religious denominationgt it was about wanting to control women not money for onceplease dont jump to conclusions you cant support with some kind of evidence  its either about wanting to control women or its about a sincere moral opposition to birth control as a concept  that you and i might not be able to understand the ideology behind the moral opposition is immaterial to the fact that it might be sincere  i dont see how it serves any purpose to say they want to control women when perhaps all they want to do is control contraception republicans hypothetically have a problem with any state sponsored medical benefit so why target contraceptives and abortion unless they have a particular gripe with those products  republicans are against national healthcare to the point that they largely support reduction in medicare and medicaid just not to the people currently over   their voting bloc so why not a firestorm against alzheimers treatments or pacemakers  to think that this is strictly a fiscal conservative stance is ludicrous this is the same crowd that equates drawing a distinction between statutory rape and violent forcible rape to being pro rape  mitt romney takes comfort surrounded bales straw he atease its easier to build more strawmen if you come prepared   yeah he uses that prop quite a bit in order to seem folksy  i think he was in a hay fort when he got into the infamous corporations are people my friend argument   bales of straw dont ask uncomfortable questions im the real atease  year if youve ever been on a working farm youll know the interview station needs a few bales to soak up moisture and also to block some of the wind that tends to dry out some of your flimsier flooring materials my dads is actually used wood covered in canvas if you can believe that  i dont understand how any voter can watch that footage without feeling that their intelligence is being insultedsame goes for both parties for the most part by the way  and almost anything tv news does  its just such fake manufactured bullshit  if you want my vote or my viewership if youre a tv station you can win some brownie points by acting like you think im an adult he reminds car salesman will whatever takes you car today fucking schmuck stick while economic plans running taken seat people facts aaaaaaaaaand misleading title reddit politics i think you mean rrepublicanssuckamirite hardly  mitt romney has voiced support for legislation that defines life as beginning at conception which would ban most forms of hormonal birth control which most women currently use  i doubt he is ignorant of this fact so i think he is being misleading to intentionally play on the ignorance of voterssource   this article worst kind spin imaginable romney slug reasonsfirst romney would state wants implement kind social healthcare system thats great let state that traditional conservatives powerfully notion state government federal government states govern themselves conservative state decides universal health care good thing terrific state governments closer their people than federal government definitionsecond topic contraception there fundamental difference believing use contraception requiring insurance provider subsidize it theres inconsistent romneys position here many conservatives federal government constitutional authority force religious organization say catholic hospital provide contraception employees them will agree american perfect use it unless course its socalled abortofascient case theyll up your uterus againfor fucks sake theres wrong with mans politics platform without stooping kind wordwrangling that article reflects badly liberals reflects badly kind leftwing media conservatives love complain about this stupid article its clouding real issues real problems if we claim as we do rightwing media fond distorting facts their candidates good opposing candidates bad we willing call media left exactly thingthis bad reporting bad politics our country better misrepresenting politicians position cheap jabs unworthy united states gtthis is bad reporting and bad politics our country can do better misrepresenting a politicians position to make cheap jabs at him or her is unworthy of the united statesim starting to doubt this fox news dailykos the people upvoting this thread they exemplify modern american politicism can you tell where likes abortion cause i find sound bite would love hear it abortion was covered by romneycare which he boasts about and says he is proud ofmaybe read the articleedit butthurt over your own inability to understand what he was actually saying  downvote for me whateveredit  i am crying over here with all four of these downvotes  waaaa that doesnt mean he likes abortion though being proud of a piece of legislation doesnt mean being proud of every single element in it i actually just read your post now and down voted you for your edit youre now at  because of me the  was caused by someone elsealso as cymick says he never says he likes abortion no where does he say that the title is misleading just because a health insurance plan covers it doesnt mean he likes it maybe that was covered as a deal made by the legislature in the state to pass it through maybe it was covered after a court ruling ruled they had to i dont know and neither do you without extensive research on the topic of how romneycare got passedthe point remains he never said he likes abortionnow carry on being butthurt over your downvotes today oddnumbered day  on oddnumbered days liberal numbered days conservative  does matter though the president overturn roe v wade right from understanding appoint justices feels would vote wayobama president gays marry when bush president women abortions im attacking all i wonder when were going choosing leaders based two issues alone two issues change matter whos charge its a form of slacktivism people can feel good for voting even if the president doesnt change anything slacktivism i love it thanks im going to use that one

while systematically stabbing kittens so as to harvest their blood for his money tree unless your remark is tongueincheek you failed to use the sarcasm font if that was your intent willard was born in the us  his dad was born in mexico because he had  grandmothers lol republicans are partisan hacks who constantly resort to cheap antics and yellow journalism we must be exactly the samestay classy rpoliticsalso go fuck yourself rpolitics im trapped in a glass case of emotionedit i dont get why lenny is being downvoted hes just telling us not to resort to yellow journalism no tax returns are not the same as the birthers thing    the tax returns show what he has been doing with his money  has he been hiding it from the us tax system  is a tax cheat a good thingin  when george romney released his actual tax returns for the previous  years one year could be a fluke perhaps done for show mitt the son has only released one yeari would like to personally return the favor and tell you to do the same thing that you suggest rpolitics do i said the tactic ie making unsubstantiated claims because you havent been given irrefutable evidence to the contrary is the same i didnt say the unsubstantiated claims were comparable no its not  the birthers have proof he was born here  they chose to ignore itwe have exactly one year of his tax returns  even his father said one year is not enough  why is his money offshore in a know tax haven  what tax rate does he pay on the money outside the usthese are all very good questions  even his father agreed i never said they werent legitimate questions i said the ops proposal to make a and i quote huge deal about them distracting people once again like the  other posts at the top of rpolitics about romney right now from policies

same  but apparently she is an incumbent representative running for reelection  first off she should clearly release  of her tax returns and she is a dumbass for not doing so long ago  but more importantly why is a sitting representative the head of the dnc  that really needs to be someones full time job  its no wonder that the democrats have been fucking up  the last chair i remember was

what they like who cares one difference two political parties side genuinely stuck staying close truth i telling truth mind you staying close it concerned with telling compelling story obamacare

killed kerry i think republicans choice candidate r candidate d with candidate r better choice they turned argument candidate d cant president who candidate r is its scorched earth policy works im democrats lie claim side evil incarnate win elections theyve won without that but they strong narrative who republicans are romney just screaming tax returns crap unless its pointing bigger picture thats clearly defined screaming vote mitt canibal romney tldr republicans attack democrats dont mitt eats people weekendsedit  if you think im advocating democrats lie romney attack way they attack democrats im not i find humor way people approach attack two sides aisle someone points article mitt outsource theres debate when mitt left bain awesome im interested what truth will follow it repeat unless its true based facts conjecture this meant proscriptive what i humorous observation right wrong karl rove is that you obama needs to hire this guy asap not the most well reasoned post but i enjoyed it  enjoy this one i thought about using reason and facts in a response extolling the virtues of pure emotional attacks then said fuck it  that would be silly and more work than i care to do i think its funnier the way you did it it would also be inconsistent with your message ronjon the flip flopper i dont know if reddit had a best of i think id nominate your plan of attack on romney and his perfect hair is wonderfully skirting the boundary of logic for med rbestof refuting your nonsense about corporate raiding and shipping jobs overseas  hey dont bring your silly facts around here  no one wants to hear it yeah about that factcheck does seem to take everyones word at face value most of the time  really all we have to do is follow the money  which would be easier if romney released his tax returns  which is obviously why hes not doing thatedit typo did you not read the obama campaign also notes that romney retained his ownership in bain even after he left in february  thats truebut theres no evidence that he took any active role in bains decisions after he left in february  he was still the sole stockholder chairman of the board chief executive officer and president i think youre fooling yourself if you think he had no say in any of its dealings after february  youre just guessing now theres no evidence that he took any active role in bains decisions after he left in february  just because you want something to be true doesnt make it sothere is however evidence to show your precious obama using taxpayer money to fund green initiatives that create jobs in europe and mexico  i understand that im not saying that romney for sure is guilty of that all i am pointing out is that the facts that you used to refute an earlier claim are themselves under scrutany at the moment romney wasnt involved in any investment decisions mcdonald said he was on the sec filings becasue he was still techinically the owner but hadnt transferred ownership to other partnersthe facts supposed under scrutiny are acknowledged by factcheck and still said to show no proof youre taking the religious logic of prove there isnt a god obama mad a claim mitt romney shipped jobs overseas theres no proof of this gti think the republicans get that the choice isnt between candidate r and candidate d with candidate r being the better choice they have turned the argument into candidate d cant be president regardless of who candidate r is its a scorched earth policy that worksthis anyone but obama is that like anyone but bush yep equally worthless didnt work out too well for the dems thats how we got obama gtmaybe he went to a segregated golf course at some point in his life doesnt matter when mind youyoure still thinking like a rationalistit doesnt fucking matter if its true liegthe owns a segregated golf course that his father builtfixed that for you this so what youre saying is that rather than have an intelligent debate which many of us claim to want we should go on a semitrue character assault im not saying your analysis of the republican strategy is inaccurate hell i think its pretty damn good but isnt there something to be said for rising above the mudslinging  but he eats corporations all the time i love the fact that you get it but i am saddened by how few liberals especially ones running the democratic national party simply dontin the end facts or the truth dont matterits simply coming up with an emotional attack that ends up working best to the uneducated massesobama is probably one of the most downtoearth presidents that this country has ever had so how do the republicans counter that by spinning this persona that hes some uppity elitist its a brilliant strategy because its down right near impossible to counterarguing tax code or deficit spending isnt going to work with anyone because they are such complex issues and the average person can barely calculate the tip on a  meal best way to go after romney is through personal attacks showing how out of touch he is with average americans the fact that the democrats havent spun some kind of story with him and his million dollar horses shows how clueless they are when it comes to attacking the other side oh jeez im not sure i get any of this theres too many factors  i just see the humor in the difference between liberal and conservative attacks also why do you call the democratic national party liberal  more liberal than the tea party maybe but that isnt hard  democrats today are the republicans of yesterday in some significant respects  certainly they are more conservative than they were  years ago  though i may be mistaking spineless for more conservative correct me if im wrong  they do need a strong narrative i completely agreeyou work in advertisingmarketing i bet  obama knows how to attack his attack ads arent much about policy and nearly all about romney this may come as a surprise to you but not all democrats are the same ken and barbie romney  that is what i call them     good advice from ronjon come on reddit lets roll we create memes lets do thishere are some more attacks i was brainstorming up anyone want to add on or amplify these  we americans believe in god but mitt romney believes in that mormon cult his dad was a polygamist mitt is a polygamist too after all he has four fancy houses does he have a different family at each one mitt is a polygamistwhy is he hiding his polygamist faith from us we americans believe in fairness in the principle that all men are created equal mitt romney does not  he used his familys money to go to the fanciest schools then get himself a cushy executive job firing decent hardworking americans mitt romney as a sociopathic executive at bain drove dozens of laidoff workers to commit suicide after he laid them off why is he refusing to talk about it we americans believe in kindness and decency mitt romney is probably a murderer all his classmates remember him as a foulmouthed brat who beat up on other kids for being different mitt romney is a psychopath and murderer he beat one of his victims to death but no one in the media is talking about this we americans believe in america mitt romney doesnt mitt romney keeps his money in europe and in foreign tax havens because he doesnt believe in the security of america where did that money come from and where is it going could it be hed done some money laundering for some human trafficking we should investigate this but mitt romney refuses to release his tax records hes hiding something mitt romney has hidden records of his crimerelated foreign bank accounts because he launders money for human traffickers id back off from number  the whole class warfare thing is never going to work in the us and its not a reliable strategy anywhere in the worldnumber  is what id go for but id need to know more about democratic voters will this turn a lot of them off id just try and paint a narrative of him being out of touch he dressed up as a police officer and pulled people over for fun he roped a dog to the top of his car and took a long trip hes a polygamist his family are extremists mormons hate normal christian doctrines talk about what bain capital has done talk about his offshore bank account do all this in crazy hyped up exaggerated terms and you could paint a narrative of why a freak like romney will screw up the country the problem with  is that liberals are generally advocates of tolerance of all relationship types involving consenting adults  if there is shown any intolerance of such a thing then the conservatives will pounce on that and use it to show that liberals are just as intolerant you would do better to target the republican voters with number  if you cut off the republican support mitt would not have any legs to stand on all this is gold can you please forward these to news outlets good job  i heard mittens is going to classify alcohol as a schedule  drug not alcohol tobacco yes god yes i watched so goes the nation today you nailed it bo knows how to avoid most of these sand traps thats why no promising republicans even bothered to run for the nom this year for real though thnks for posting this i think you nailed it most independent fact check groups pronounced obamas outsourcing claims about romney as not true or false why do you hate america  damn im good at thisi just did a search and couldnt find anything about that not being true  if you happen to have a link could you post it  if not no worries  cant tell if idiot or very very good subtle name based troll youre the idiot spend two seconds googling because you starting pavlovically defending your partisan side  next time put the link in the original claim so you dont look like an idiot then    yes obamas people played loose and fast with the facts but give them some time to hone the message and get it right and bain will look just as shitty as they would if the original attack had been deemed  accurate  personally i think theyre barking up the wrong tree and heres why    some of the companies bainromney invested in they basically gutted and forced bankruptcy and some of the companies they invested in did very well  this is not disputed and romney likes to tout that hes created between  and  jobs    my issue is that in this process he destroyed thousands of jobs as well and even if you dont bring up the fact that hes counting  jobs at staples as jobs he somehow created when he was really only an investor bain invested  in staplesand took a mostly hands off approach those jobs are not career jobs the vast majority of them are retail level ie nearly or at minimum wage  same with the jobs he created at sports authority and dominoes all low wage non career jobs  meanwhile the jobs he doesnt like to talk about are the jobs lost at companies bain ordered major outsourcing at and the jobs at companies that went under shortly after bain saddled them with millions in debt and bled them dry  a good example to look up would be gst steel when they went under we may have only lost  jobs but those were career jobs that paid way more than a staples job    the problem is the general public doesnt understand nuance and they havent figured out how to put what im saying into a  second ad    i could go on with more examples of bain bleeding companies dry and killing off high paying jobs then replacing them in their final net jobs count with minimum wage jobs but since you think im an idiot for not doing my own research on your claim you decided not to back up in your original post look it up yourself   based on your silly rant it looks like you have a problem with capitalism souh this debate is pointless what kind of imbecile thinks you should be able to support a family on low wage jobs or that creatingreplacing low wage jobs to make a company profitable is a bad thing its a business not a charity i dont have a problem with capitalism i have a problem with electing someone thats stated multiple times that he wants to run the government like a business  to romney this means fire all the workers to turn a profit  our economic problem has nothing to do with the defecit it has to do with economic prosperity and the best way to fix it is more jobs that pay a living wage not killing living wage jobs and replacing them with minimum wage jobs  all that will do is reduce consumer demand for goods and services even more and if you think its bad now wait till all the major manufacturers start laying off en masse because theres no longer any demand for their goods because the rich dont spend all their money on goods and services    why dont you look up leveraged buyouts there is nothing good for the economy about them in fact after bainromney perfected it and we saw what it really did they quickly changed what they called it so it wouldnt be obvious that they are the dicks killing our economy     you say not to have a problem with capitalism but you clearly have a problem with balancing a budget if you think not spending more than you take in is a bad thingthe fact you also think expanding government worker benefitshiring is a way to fix a dragging private sector shows how out of touch you are you know what that post could use  links to those independent fact check groups  you distraction issues people talk defining american political sphere vapid vacuousthe birthers example that this the possibility of a president avoiding taxes by using safe havens in the cayman islands swiss banks and shell companies in bermuda is a much more egregious offense than some crazies thinking obama wasnt born in america  the fact that his ira is worth at least  million dollars is cause enough for concern when iras are made for much smaller donation amounts than he could have possibly accumulated tax returns speak to the quality of romneys character something that people should take into account when selecting a president to me it comes down to this why would i pay taxes to an organization run by a person who avoids paying taxes that is a very clear and concise way to put it  do you mean tim geitnerbesides romney has already released his tax returns this is just a selfpost circlejerk for the uninformed tim geitner was not an elected official i did not have the luxury of examining his tax record before placing him in office as i do with romney that said he is certainly a smear on the obama administration now that it has come out and for the record i voted third party last electionreleasing tax returns is a separate issue the reason the rich place money in foreign banks is to avoid having to account for that money in their tax return it could be worth up to  million but as the article says while this could happen legally its very rare but well never know because he wont release his taxes  right i was using the lower number because its still a number that is way higher than most iras are  either way its rather despicable  the sob better release his taxes i understand how his ira got so huge and at least on an ethical level it is fraud he has holdings in a roth ira which is tax free when he retires over a hundred million thats right he gots a roth ira which has a hundred million init us regular citizens can only put six thousand a year away romney is probably with a billion plus  ok this whole debate has already taken place today on reddit on a post that made it to the top of rpolitics once but anyway i guess ill post all of this again gt the possibility of a president avoiding taxes by using safe havens in the cayman islands swiss banks and shell companies in bermuda why would he dodge taxes illegally when he can do them legally via the messed up tax code he does not do his own taxes he has accountants and lawyers do them for him and there practices are on the line if they do anything illegal gt he fact that his ira is worth at least  million dollars is cause enough for concern when iras are made for much smaller donation amounts than he could have possibly accumulated there are others who have iras that are worth as much as well one way of getting an ira this large is to invest your ira into your own start up the value of that investment climbs drastically if the company is super successful which bain capital was if there was anything illegal you sure as hell would not hide it in an ira worth  million the irs would ask a lot of questions about such an unusual ira gt tax returns speak to the quality of romneys character something that people should take into account when selecting a presidentim not sure how a document written by paid professionals speaks to the character of someonegt more egregious offense than some crazies thinking obama wasnt born in america the birther crap is nonsense and was a political game to stir up votes so is this notion that romney did something illegal because he is not releasing his tax returns do you not trust the irs to do their job properly i do just as i trusted the state of hawaii when they said obama was born in america  you mind shooting that link this way  id like to read it gtwhy would he dodge taxes illegally when he can do them legally via the messed up tax code he does not do his own taxes he has accountants and lawyers do them for him and there practices are on the line if they do anything illegalthats not a logical argument  its like saying why would people smoke marijuana if k or spice is available and legal  the fact is tax evasion happens  just because theres a legal way to do something doesnt mean that people wont still take the illegal route if its in their interest even if what he did was  legal which we cant really know unless he releases his tax returns it still seems rather unethical to me  personally this becomes a character issue is it too much to ask for some transparency from someone running for the highest office in the landgt im not sure how a document written by paid professionals speaks to the character of someonejust because he has a shield lawyers and accountants doesnt mean he was completely removed from the process  i highly doubt his accountants set up his swiss bank account and put that money into the cayman islands without his knowledge or consent if thats what did happen what does that say about the type of people he would nominate for cabinet positions and the other various appointments a president does how is tax avoidance which is legal as severe as a threat to the integrity of the office of the president as the president not being legally qualified to hold the office not born in usanot saying i believecare about either thing i just think your statement is silly its not whether the offenses are equal but whether there is any justification for the accusation  theres no proof whatsoever that obama was born outside of the united states except that his dad was born in kenya  maybe im the irrational one here but i would want to know if my president has been avoiding paying his fair share of taxes by hiding that money overseas  theres at least evidence in the case of romney  his tax returns would clear all this up  its not a particularly unusual thing for candidates to release their tax returns hell his dad did it  even if its not illegal its pretty unethical there is at least evidence pointing to romneys use of tax havens even if what he did was legal  this is the key distinction between this and the birthers  look as much as i hated to agree with some of the birthers i had to if only for the fact that i need to show more proof of citizenship to get a license to drive than you do to become president that is not righti have no problem with people asking to see more of romneys tax returns but i also want to see the records about obama that he refuses to release good for the goose and all that btw if romney moved money around to avoid taxes but did nothing illegal i have no problem with it our current president not only smoked illegal substances but snorted them too while i am one of the people who wants drugs to be legalized if you want to talk about character it needs to be more than a onesided conversation are you implying obama never got a license to drive dun dun dunnnnnn but the birther movement has no basis in facts just circumstantial evidence at best that his father was kenyan  it is known that mitt romney had a shell company in bermuda that he transferred ownership to his wife on the eve of his governorship as well as the swiss bank account dodging taxes is illegal doing drugs when you were a teenager or even in your s is completely different than avoiding taxes while you are an otherwise successful businessman  we all do stupid things when were young not that smoking weed is dumb but these are completely different  one is not characteristic of the person he is today one is  i dont think we should judge romney based on what he did as a teenager dressing up like a cop and pulling people over also illegal or supposedly bullying gay teens anymore than we do obama and his past drug use  but doing something illegal when youre young because youre rebellious obama and doing something illegal while youre middle aged because you dont want to do what is legally required romney are not comparable offenses edit spelling its not that his father was kenyan but that he was possibly born in kenya but if his mother was a us citizen i dont see the problemanyway nothing you have mentioned about romney is illegal avoiding taxes is not illegal it is a tactic of a smart business person if you want to call it immoral okay ill disagree with that but such an argument makes more sense why would people think that he was born in kenya other than the fact that his father was kenyan  there was no evidence to point to his birth being anywhere other than hawaii regardless my issue is that it is impossible to ascertain whether or not it was illegal  in all likelihood it isnt but i do find it odd that he has refused to do what so many presidential candidates have done over the years  theres also the fact that when he gave  years of tax returns to the mccain team back in  they then picked sarah palin  if sarah palin was their next bet choice after seeing those returns there is probably something questionable contained therein morality isnt the issue here its the ethics  i dont see those two terms as synonymous  if hes unwilling to do what so many others have done that raises questions to me   i would be surprised if he didnt eventually release most of them as the weeks go by but he wont do it when the other team wants that makes him look like he lost the battleas for mccain first off there were people who wanted to exclude mccain from being eligible for the presidency because he was born in the panama canal zone second off while romney was considered for vp he would have made a poor choice politically when a candidate chooses or the party sometimes a vp candidate they look for someone who can round out the ticket mccain was widely viewed on the right as being too liberal part of why some republican leaders thought he would be attractive to independent voters but it certainly didnt fire up the conservative base so they picked someone who was exciting to those people and who might be exciting to the undecided that didnt work out well enough btw perhaps i am wrong but im sure that the obama team has copies of those tax records and if there was a smoking gun in there we would have heard about it by nowedit forgot to mention that i believe people think he was born in kenya because they had been in kenya almost immediately prior to his birth gtif only for the fact that i need to show more proof of citizenship to get a license to drive than you do to become presidentwhat the fuck you dont think he had to go through federal background checks when he was nominated you think the nsa cia fbi and hls just let him come on board without a cursory glance at his record wow its not part of their charter and i have never seen a report to that effect i pray you can prove me wrong exactly  we need to try to improve the discourse not follow that lead the problem with this is that idiots votethis is something that always frustrates me when i see intelligent and well spoken candidates lose because they havent figured that out yet romney has a serious chance of winning not because hes a great candidate but because for the last  years the gop has been lying to idiots and now its in the collective unconscious of the united states that obama is a big spender or a muslim or a sleeper cell communist or whatever meanwhile smart people are like that sort of slander has no place in politics and then they lose the electionif you want to win youve got to win the idiots too ernnyggh ehhgll ghrrakkh  esh so true  your eloquence is a credit to your species yeti ghknn really i wonder how this is even possibledamnation what are you talking about  these are tax returns not a birth certificate  there is a huge difference and this is entirely relevant as many people would like to know how he manages large amounts of money since hes trying to command the largest economy in the world   two things  i think trying to emulate gop mudslinging is just playing into the both parties are equally bad narrative  second those undecided voters who are not swayed by romneys record hypocrisy and massive sway to the right are not going to be bothered by his tax records  any in depth analysis by media will be interpreted as bias well then what do we do  continuously take the high road and let the right wingers score all the points with the rather largeportion of the populace that only responds to such  i mean if youve found something that consistently works on a huge portion of the populace the way that does the dems would love to hear about it theyve tried intelligent discourse theyve tried facts theyve tried experts and scientists theyve tried everything but sinking to their level    whats left   the president is a dem and that is not likely to change next term  independent voters are beginning to see through gop misinformation and the gop base continues to age  give it time   difference tax returns disqualify running office if you bad tax history youd fit with political dumbasses if you werent born america you cannot legally be president thats why huge fuss birth certificate crap so we focus real issues economy unemployment middle east rising gas prices focusing crap matters what fork joe block ate with two weeks ago gt  if you werent born in america you cannot legally be president this is an interesting and contested claimyou realize romneys father was born in mexico and ran for the republican presidential nominationhe argued that he was a natural born citizen on the basis of his parentage which is pretty reasonable  the alternative is a naturalized citizen  yet the issue is trickybecause in  a person born to us parents overseas was a natural born citizen by act of congress but in  this became just a citizen in a subsequent act  and it is unclear whether such acts are allowed to interpret the constitution mccain was born in the panama canal zone which was not a us territory and many other people born there were not automatically given citizenship and his  citizenship by virtue of his canal zone birth was asserted by a law after his birth so he was arguably not naturally born a citizen though a citizen by fact of birth   interesting discussion here so if you favor the  law not clearly the correct interpretation but a defensible one then mccain was ineligible gt thats why everyone made a huge fuss over the birth certificate crapbut they dont make a fuss for mccain where the legal evidence for nonnaturalborn citizenship is stronger gt thats why everyone made a huge fuss over the birth certificate crapincorrectthere were two groups of people who made an issue of obamas birthplace group a racists and group b people pandering to group a incorrect  you do not need to be born on us soil to be president  you only require to be a natural born citizen  there are two ways to be a natural born citizen be born on us soil jus soli right of the land or be born anywhere else in the world from  us parents jus sanguini right of bloodjust to stop the misinformation  carry on edit  usc   could lying about your taxes be considered high crimes and misdemeanors   thats why everyone made a huge fuss over the birth certificate crap they actually made a big deal out of it because they were fucking racist pricks  but we might find out hes wealthy and last i checked youre not technically a real intouch with the average joe politician if youre worth over  million or was it  million i can never remember or we might find out that hes either   a guilty of tax fraud  b guilty of voter fraud  c both    it wouldnt matter at this point if mitt was worth  million hes rich we get iteditspellin n stuffs good luck with that wait democrats are filthy rich toowhy didnt anyone tell me yeah guys lets enthusiastically play party politics buy broken election system yearwe spend two years complaining terrible system forget when we elections again if it keeps the republicans from controlling all three branches so be it its a laudable shortterm goal democrats are evil too my friendwtf is a democrat anymore anyway  obama is right there next to romney both right wing authoritarians  it really cracks me up when i hear how big of a leftist obama is  he basically continued all of bushs shitty policies and then some ok lets follow your plan of bitching on reddit instead is that really the only other option you can envision that way we wont talk issues ever woooo question why we critical romney and obama yes fight fire with fire that always works butthe flamesthey are so pretty as opposed to rolling over and surrendering which is a great tactic and gop even bigger deal fast furious and dnc even biggerer deal romneys police impersonation and gop big fucking deal healthcare penalty and dnc gigantic super deal tax breaks wealthy and gop super kamehameha primosuperb deal blind sheikhs second phone call morsi its bunch powerhungry thieves frauds cheats lets delusional side corruption where your sympathies lie its a tax not a penalty  just sayin a tax and a penalty are the same thing just sayin  so you are penalized on the money you earn at a regular job  the irs penalizes you for being a working wage earning american  no its not the same thing i agree its worth noting small possibility baiting obama with birthers when finally releases tax returns there will horrible will lecture left rich people people too dare we start class war blahblahblahi wouldnt hold breath though hes lot answer for i think hell release anything this issue mittens magic mormon refusing presidents decades his tax returns releasedromney  taxes completed hell release them toooctober deadline tax extensionshow tax extension worksis you file extension pay estimated tax amount you until october th file return most people with large amounts holdings spread large numbers investments use method time constraints february   april th too thin the extension allows time gather filing documents your tax money april th why people filing extension will overpay avoid underpaymentwhy you start screaming tax returns october th when returns will finished filed because most presidential candidate release years upon years of tax returns not most just somesome of the important ones though obama released  years of tax returns gw bush did  clinton did  reagan did  nixon did  carter did  bush sr did the kicker though is mitts own father released  years when he ran for president and if we try and distill a pattern it is that the amount of disclosure expected from our presidential candidates is increasing the  gt  gt  gt  gt  makes the  stick out all of those are more than   just sayin why is this so far down  i finally see why people unsub from this subreddit rpolitics is  giant circlejerk  rabble rabble whargarrrblefact are not interesting here  just hate i have my suspicions that romney didnt release any earlier years because he may have paid no income tax or an absurdly low rate in  most of his income is capital gains that he can write off losses imagine how that would look  it would probably look like he complied with tax regulations i dont deny that  regardless it wouldnt look good for his campaign and there would be lots of negative ads saying he didnt pay taxes out of context though  if his detractors would use that information so spin hatred for him instead of sticking with the issues wouldnt that be pretty despicable were still talking about politics right where is the line between politics and ethics  its when you go from issues to smear based on how it could look i dont deny that  regardless it wouldnt look good for his campaign and there would be lots of negative ads saying he didnt pay taxes out of context though

was only referencing that michigan where he is campaigning today is the state where he himself was born and raised spokesman rick gorka also downplayed the remarks ina gaggle with reporters after the

with it speaking of mitts father lets not forget that george romney was born in mexico in a polygamist commune and that didnt change his eligibility for the presidency because he had american parentsthe birther debate was settled  years ago by mitts father and it is shameful to see mitt parading around like this though admittedly there isnt much mitt does these days that isnt shameful it doesnt matter where the hell obama was born because his mother is irrefutably american funny coincidence george settled both the birther issue and the taxreturn issue  like father like ah fuck it like father like fuckupdid i help you did good  gtyou did wellftfythat guy well you didyoda i believe in this case actually that both are correct he has done good here meaning his contributions were deemed goodthat guy  superman does good you doin well you need to study your grammar sontracy morgan prescriptivist you did well umm he said he helped right superman helps because he does good right so in this case its not well because he didnt do someone well he did someone good  you did good son you did goodadmiral anderson you did good pig you doin well liz lemon superman does good the amazing thing is that mitt is such an asshat rich guy that he doesnt get how totally insulting this isromney there are also white foreign people you moronmy parents are both caucasian but met and had kids in venezuela so my older siblings were not born in america does anyone ever ask them if they are citizens no romney  because we have a lot of ignorant assholes just like youromney can keep the election close if he just keeps pandering to assholes  but hes in danger of alienating all but the hairy pink assholes thats quite an accomplishmenttheyll have to depend on voting machine irregularities to have a shot in hell at winning if he keeps pandering to ignorant assholes the election will not be close just because the ignorant are the loudest in the room does not mean they represent the electorate  this is very true hes got no chance in hell with the independentsunenrolled whatever you want to call them who are either voting obama paul or writing in some fictional space captain  his delusion is that he thinks they are all tea party and will fall into line like the rest of the tea party who are actually just gop  i dont knowi know a lot of republicans and that crazy shit is like the gospel to them  they eat it up and ask for seconds  i really dont know anybody who is like yeah they should lower taxes on the rich so they can afford to give us more jobs  but obamas in office so we should get behind him and try to at least get the economy moving again  it just doesnt happen unless maybe if youre a libertarian  if you are a true republican youll be repeating every vile nasty thing that sarah palin spews during one of her constipationofthebraindiarrheaofthemouth tirades and echoing all of the bullet points from rush limbaugh  obama is a socialist terrorist  and hes going to kidnap our babies and grind them upi assure you they really are that crazy i know how crazy they are i joined a tea party for two months for a research class they are loud angry passionate and they do not want facts they just want their way also they never take you off of email lists no matter how many times you ask regardless of how loud thy are and how much they support those who express their view they are not the majority they are not even close  shu the electorate maybe not the electoral college however lets hope youre right mitts own father was born in mexico but he wasnt a mexican of the sort the radical right dislikes for racist reasons he only lived in mexico so he could practice polygamy and run an unofficial theocratic fiefdom in the form of a mormon camp by the way what are mitts views on poligamy  but his grandparents were american citizens yes his grandparents moved to mexico with other mormons and lived on what some call a polygamy colony but his grandparents were not official polygamists and apparently had a monogamist relationship thats what i read in the papers anyway it really doesnt matter to me polygamy same sex marriage are all fine with me mitt has come out against same sex marriage i believe  says we will have a lot of diebold issues going on this novemeber they got good ol fashioned voter suppression too lets not forget that im white im a legal resident now in tx  im canadian  but i still get referred to as an alien  hes an asshat gt theyll have to depend on voting machine irregularities to have a shot in hell at winningas much as id like to think this is true the pollssay otherwise and voter id laws come november voting machine irregularities came here to say the same that was some pretty thinly veiled racist bullshit who in the hell is he pandering to with that he already has the rich bigot white guy vote doesnt he no no youre on to something im pretty sure mittens kids are completely fucked in the head too like father like like ya cant get fooled again mitts an anchor baby i know there was a group calling themselves the returners lets start making photos of mitt as an anchor baby  soy un perdador im an anchor baby so why dont you kill me i always thought he was saying soooopen up the door  it just goes to show that both obama and mitt were born as the hardworking sons of immigrants who worked their way up from nothing right mitt wasnt born with a silver spoon no sir he was born with a silver soon in his ass well he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth but his head is so far up his ass it makes no difference  soon  stop it he isnt allowed to fap hasnt left the gated community yet either maybe one day maybe romney should have written dreams from my father a story of wealth and inheritance hes still a piece of shit along with vp rapefuck george was in a way the man john mccain was born in panama oddly enough obama and hilary clinton cosponsored a bill declaring mccain a citizen with full eligibility to be president edit fulltext of billits short til bills can be written and passed on the behalf of a single person happens all the time  people can get and have received citizenship via federal law  its called a private bill  totally legal so long as the law isnt punitive  people sometimes get money from congress via private bill usually things like legal feesbtw the clintonmccain bill was probably invalid or at least irrelevant because a law cant override the constitutional requirement  isnt it pretty much agreed that a military base is american soil the constitution is kinda vague about what is america there were only thirteen states at the time not at all  what about a japanese couple working on the base in okinawa that has a baby there i think the relevance of the bill was basically were not going to make this a campaign issuesince after that how could you bills are also passed to commemorate college sports teams and their recent accomplishments actually if you look at the text its a senate resolution thats basically moreorless an endorsement deal by the us senate does not qualify as bill of attainder  its funny im a lawyer and i would have guessed it was a bill of attainder  perhaps that appellation only applies to bills with negative consequences for the named persons though as a result of the meaning attainder had under english law huh i remember being told that that was specifically prohibited under the millenniumold legal tradition that the us uses   i think youre thinking of ex post facto lawsyou cant make something illegal after its been donecongress can also pass pretty much anything as lawits up the the judicial branch to undo the laws they deem unconstitutionaledit you might also be thinking of bills of attaindercant make a bill trying to punish one person or one specific group technically they cannot pass laws targeted as a single person or individual but they can get around that by having a law for all left handed people over the age of  who were born under the light of a full moon etc gt you might also be thinking of bills of attainderyou cant make a bill trying to punish one person or one specific groupunless its acorn of course that is a pretty classy thing for them to do for a republican  from what i recall mccainalso held some belowthebelt punches when running against obama  i am not sure why everything is getting more polarized and ugly  for example why did republicans criticize obama about killing osama  that was the type of badass move that they would have celebrated in the streets if a republican president pulled off  alternatively creating a attenuated string of eventsin an attempt to link romney to a womans death after bain layoffs isnt reasonable eitherpersonally i am pretty ambivalent to both of these candidates  however i am confident that this country will not collapse under either candidate  more importantly we are electing a president and not a king  whoever wins will still have to work within the boundaries of their role and in cooperation with congress so even a terrible president is limited in the harm that they can do  the greater threat to the country would be for their to be an ever increasing partisan divide this divide causes people to believe that the other sides positions come from a malicious desire to undermine the nation rather than the expression of different values  this type of divide if it continues long enough and grows deep enough will cause far more damage to this nation than either of these candidates you have missed the very important difference between those things the gop leadership and elected republicans themselves derided president obama for killing osama and spiking the football over and over the shitty commercial linking the womans cancer death to romney was made by a non affiliated pac made possible by citizens united and not approved of by any democratic leadership or elected members the partisan divide is being generated by the right propaganda machine and the people taking those pundits words as absolute truth  i cannot tell you how many conservatives have no actual clue what the progressive agenda actually is all they know is the lies told to them by fox news and the right talk radio     most of them actually agree that the actual progressive agenda is pretty reasonable and fair but they still dont believe that it is really the progressive agenda because limbaugh told them that we are evil liars out to destroy the nation and redistribute all the wealth written and sponsored by todd akins democrat opponent claire mccaskillas if you needed any more reason to support her wasnt there a brief period where they congress were considering writing one for ahnold edit n the wake of the california recall election  this proposal was widely seen as an attempt to make california governor arnold schwarzenegger born in austria and naturalized in  eligible for the presidency and is sometimes nicknamed arnold bill   so obama and clinton cosponsored a bill declaring panama to be united states  he was born on a military base or something so american soil that doesnt actually matter its commonly believed that you have to be born on us soil but thats never stated in the constitution just that you have to be a natural born citizensome interpret that to mean born on us soil but the courts have interpreted it to mean that you are a citizen from birth having citizen parents makes that so good to know my kids could be president no matter where theyll be born actually at the time the panama canal zone was considered us soil we didnt revert it back to the panamanians until  iirc mccain was born on a military base there its considered us soil  dmhad american parents exactly his birthplace was a nonissue like obamas but crazy people made it a problem anyway  of course obamas mother is american to and the us senate voted unanimously to accept his situation as equivalent to being a natural born citizen  obviously the senate did not bother with obama because he was born in hawaii well i mean is hawaii really part of america its like out in the ocean and shit practically next door to new zealandyanno im almost shocked that congress this past  years didnt try to kick hawaii out of the us then use that to claim obama wasnt a citizen dumber things have happenededit guess i should say dumber things have been attempted sounds frothy i dont know dumber things have definitely happened just not that recently i think thatd be a great thing to happen  hawaii doesnt need the us any more theyd do just fine on their own just like the bahamas is just fine on its own  hawaiians would be better off without the rest of us whoa whoa i wasnt born in hawaii and i know there are plenty locals who would agree with you but lets not be hasty here hawaii would not be better off without you mainlanders you know how many folks would just say fuck it and go to mexico or somewhere with gambling and more lax drug laws if they already had to get a passport to travel to a tropic location speaking as a kamaaina a lot of things would change if this were to occurhawaii would likely have to resort to gambling to boost their tourism industry and recover for the loss of military spending  i am sure tax haven styled banks would also have to rise up but this is already a competitive field and i cannot be sure it would work  on this alone one wonders what hawaii would actually use for moneyi cannot think of other industries hawaii could employ to make up for the loss of military spending especially since agriculture cannot compete and tourism is the only other leg to stand onmy guess is sovereign independence would be economically catastrophicalso i know most residents who are not of hawaiian ethnicity would never want to give up their us citizenship i was so hoping that was a link thats covered in chapter   advanced karma tactics from the karmanaut chronicles how to uplift your karma score which i am sadly not up to yetif i was good i would learn to start linking things in my comments for them sweet sweet blue letter related upvotes i am from hawaii  my basic understanding i wonder what other kamaainas think is that hawaii became a state because of pearl harbors importance to air and sea travel at the time  and the legacy of japans bombing  resulted in a sympathetic status that exalted hawaii above territories such as guam and puerto ricohawaii is thus rather fortunate for today the shipping and air lanes between north america and asia take the great circle route  militarily there remains some benefit and thanks to sen inouye it will remain for some time even after he is no longer holding the seatwhile were at it it may be interesting to note that sen inouye is third on the list of succession to act as president of the united states should obama biden and boehner not be available sen inouye is the father of all baddass the kind of guy chuck norris tries to pretend to be  from that page     gton april   inouye was grievously wounded while leading an assault on a heavilydefended ridge near san terenzo in tuscany italy called colle musatello the ridge served as a strongpoint along the strip of german fortifications known as the gothic line which represented the last and most dogged line of german defensive works in italy as he led his platoon in a flanking maneuver three german machine guns opened fire from covered positions just  yards away pinning his men to the ground inouye stood up to attack and was shot in the stomach ignoring his wound he proceeded to attack and destroy the first machine gun nest with hand grenades and fire from his m thompson submachine gun after being informed of the severity of his wound by his platoon sergeant he refused treatment and rallied his men for an attack on the second machine gun position which he also successfully destroyed before collapsing from blood lossgtas his squad distracted the third machine gunner inouye crawled toward the final bunker eventually drawing within  yards as he raised himself up and cocked his arm to throw his last grenade into the fighting position a german inside fired a rifle grenade that struck him on the right elbow severing most of his arm and leaving his own primed grenade reflexively clenched in a fist that suddenly didnt belong to me anymore inouyes horrified soldiers moved to his aid but he shouted for them to keep back out of fear his severed fist would involuntarily relax and drop the grenade as the german inside the bunker reloaded his rifle inouye managed to pry the live grenade from his useless right hand and transfer it to his left as the german aimed his rifle to finish him off inouye managed at last to toss the grenade offhand into the bunker and destroy it he stumbled to his feet and continued forward silencing the last german resistance with a onehanded burst from his thompson before being wounded in the leg and tumbling unconscious to the bottom of the ridge when he awoke to see the concerned men of his platoon hovering over him his only comment before being carried away was to gruffly order them to return to their positions since as he pointed out nobody called off the war inouyes actions are indicative of what it takes to fight in war  some say that one can give the best fight by having a total disregard about whether you will die or not thinking instead for your fellows and as a team holy shit thats awesome who runs the world hawaiians so til about the most badass guy ever and i thought simo hyh was a badass i just uttered holy shit on the bus from reading this  gt and the legacy of japans bombing resulted in a sympathetic status that exalted hawaii above territories such as guam and puerto ricocongress incorporatedhawaii into the united states right away in  when they took over  it has never done so for puerto rico or guam  so the intent to make hawaii into a state was there from the beginning i dont know much about puerto rico and guams internal history save for the fact that at the time they were held by spain before become us territoriesbut hawaii was usurped by coup largely influenced by sugar barons and those interests saw an advantage in making hawaii part of the us  the main reason was to avoid a tariff on their sugar  that meant the leaders of hawaii governing over what many would call an illegal republic which temporarily replaced the kingdom of hawaii were very proamerican  im sure that made the difference  of americans do not think hawaii is part of the us  unsure note the source is a  poll so well they just banned plastic shopping bags and thats definitely not american so no fuck those islandparadiseliving pollutionhating unamerican bastardss for safety guess im gonna have to start remembering to bring in those reuseable shopping bags that are gathering dust in my trunk nope not racist enough well it is part of the states but not necessarily in north america lulz ask that to pearl harbor territory as of  and us state on august   this matters because it was  years before obama was born  funny that the extreme irony of this was lost on the birthers actually there were a bunch that were questioning mccains eligibility as well yes it got that bat shit insane mccain was born on a military base outside the us hes still eligible to be president but it was more of an issue in reality than obamas actual birthplace a piece of legislature was passed to set in stone the fact that he is considered naturalborn i believe obama supported it  actually he was born in a city hospital outside of the base  his mom didnt trust the experience of military doctors to deliver babies gt mccain was born on a military base outside the ushis birth certificate says colon the birther movement has all kinds of insanity in itits kind of hard to split hairs about it in reality it shouldnt matter if they were both born on mars they were both children of us citizens there are some fringe legal disputes about whether that is what is meant by natural born but its complete bs and certainly misses the intended point of that clause mccain was a child of two american citizens thus he was an american citizen by birth ie a naturalborn citizen he was never naturalizedthe phrase naturalborn citizen only exists in the constitution and the constitution lets congress decide what naturalborn citizen means my son was born in a belgian hospital but when we went to the embassy with his birth certificate they issued him a consular report of birth abroad the same time they issued him his first passport  how many were genuinely questioning his eligibility and how many were simply pointing out the ludicrous nature of the birther movement these were the birther types doing this they filed a lawsuit and everything were there a few that questioned mccainss eligibility maybe but ive never heard anyone make a stink about it so there certainly werent enough people pissed off to spark an entire named movement so even if the argument against mccain was miles more legitimate the controversy was no where near as seriousedit clarified it was actually a reasonably big deal at the timeto the point of there being a lawsuit filed etc the difference is that mccain lost so the issue was dropped no there werent youre probably thinking of the dems who ironically accused mccain of not being eligible to combat the insane birthirism as a way of throwing it back in their faces  knowing full well that it was a joke and wasnt meant in a sincere mannerprove me wrong but i followed that election extremely closely and i do not remember one rightwing birther accusing mccain of not being a legal citizen due to his having been born in panama gt i followed that election extremely closely and i do not remember one rightwing birther accusing mccain of not being a legal citizen due to his having been born in panamai think you may have some selective memory going onit was big enough that there were articles and legal white papers written about his eligibility and a senate resolution was passed stating he was a natural born citizenit first came up when he was running against bush as part of the push polling that was trying to convince everyone he was a manchurian candidatein the  campaign the aip filed a lawsuit challenging his eligibilityits not hard to find blog articles about itim going to assume that you are wise enough not to question the right wing credentials of a publication with the byline exposing amp combating liberal media bias it made the drudge report people wrote about it in the ny timesand the washington postmccain isnt the first to have been hit with this eg goldwater i have a question about birthers from what i understand arent birth records public or semipublic record couldnt they have just gone to whatever appropriate records office and looked at the record of his birthi mean its not his birth certificate but itd show that he was naturalbornim assuming the issue here is that im trying to apply logic to it but is the above statement actually true  not a big mccain fan here but its probably because mccain was born on a us military base and was a commissioned officer in the us navy   actually he was born in an off base hospital and it still dosent matter a parent being a citizen makes the child a natural born citizen period end of discussion unless you are a birther idiot  mccain wasnt even a close call  both his parents were citizens he could have been born on mars and been a full natural born citizen  plus panama was even under us control at the time and he was born on a us naval base obama was never a close call i never brought up his eligibilityi simply included another amusing example of a republican presidential candidate who happened to be born outside of the united statesthe humor of the situation seems to be lost on you since you included a lot of information that had nothing to do with my post here are some random statement to respond to yourspluto is not even a planet and even it was barack and michelle are still in fact natural born citizenspanama means many butterflies in an indigenous language  what do you think this impliesplus china now controls the land mccain was born on edit  forgot to include the all importan word never in my first sentence you brought up mccain and i was simply pointing out its a completely different case than a fictional world where obama was born on mars  there are two ways to get it  two american parents or born in the us  mccain satisfied   and arguably satisfied the second option because panama was functionally part of the us at the time and he was born on a base obama may or may not have satisfied the first option at the time and failed the second option only if youre a moron but thats the whole controversy   actually the panama canal zone which is an american territory technically whether or not he was eligible for president is debatable mccain was born on a us military base its funny because it was actually mccain who was born within the borders of another country a us army base in panama can you imagine if obama was born in similar circumstances the birther movement would be drooling they already are drooling and dragging their knuckles and pissing on toilet seats thats racistrednecks dont drool  that depends on how many teeth they have left  are you sure he was born on the base rumor has it he was born in a panamanian hospital the birther movement is drooling anyway but for a rather different reason actually mccain was born in the good ole us of a  the bit we stole from the columbians to build the panama canal he was born before we gave citizenship to people born in the pcz however when they gave citizenship to those in the pcz it was also retroactive so he became a citizen having either parent be a citizen makes the child a natural born citizen why cant people get that through their heads the wikipedia page you linked to actually specifically says otherwise maybe you should read the section on citizenshipthe panama canal zone was unincorporated until  and the supreme court had ruled in  that unincorporated territories did not count as us soil until  people born in unincorporated territories were classified as us nationals not us citizens in  congress passed legislation that changed this and retroactively granted such nationals citizenship statusmccain was born in  thus legally at birth he was not a us citizen he was then granted citizenship by act of congressam i saying john mccain shouldnt have been eligible to run for president no im just saying that by ultraliteral interpretation of the naturalborn citizenship clause he wouldnt be which is stupid oops good catch i didnt realize he was that old  us military bases are considered sovereign us soil  so even though someone is born outside of the  states they are still a fully naturalized citizen regardless having either parent be a citizen makes the child a natural born citizen regardless there fify i kno im just saying if it happened to obama it would be huge news thank you ive been screaming that in every birther argument since this nonsense started if at least one parent is american then you are american no matter where you were bornim convinced that both sides are ignoring this obvious argument killer because the birthers want to keep the controversy going and the democrats want to let the birthers wave their crazy flag also if the democrats brought up that side of the argument the birthers would just harp on their admission that obama wasnt born in this country so stop screaming and listen as misstre has clearly articulated the rule about one parent automatically conferring citizenship was not in existence when obama was born you are the victim of disinformation but are compounding matters by regurgitating itas the law stood in  ann dunham still on  when she gave birth to obama jr had not met the residency requirement years us residency after the age of  which would have enabled her to pass on us citizenship automatically to her son this is why it is important that obama was born on us soil jus sanguinis im not a birther but jus sanguinis citizenship is not automatically granted if only one parent is american born the parent must satisfy residency requirements since president obama was born in hawaii the point is moot though you are correct on the residency requirementshowever the argument that birthers are making is that obama was not born in hawaii if you read the linked text youll see that he didnt even need to be born in hawaii just that his mother was a us citizen and she lived in the usa for some period of time prior to his birth who and what are you arguing with i am very much aware of the content of the text i linked to you know the thing that strikes me about all this is if the birthers are right they arent why isnt the rnc the tea party and every other right wing group calling for a full investigation of the secret service the fbi the cia and the fec how could they be so utterly lax as to let a kenyan citizen slide through the obviously massive vetting process of any presidential candidate if they really believed what they are saying they would be screaming for heads to roll that it was the end of democracy i dont recall hearing anything do you ive never seen any evidence that mitt romney wasnt also born on the same polygamist compound yeah i could just google it but who has the time  im sure as hell not a birther but the constitution states that simply being a naturalborn us citizen as opposed to naturalized isnt sufficient  you must have been born in the us  hence where the birthers come in  mccains situation demonstrates that it can be extended to us ground in other countries eg army bases or embassies gtdidnt change his eligibility for the presidency because he had american parentsit doesnt matter where the hell obama was born because his mother is irrefutably americanliterally the only thing the birthers are correct about is that this is not true  in order for a child to inherit us citizenship at the time obama was born that parent had to be have living in the us for  years after their th birthday  obamas mother missed qualifying for this by a few months when he was born she was  about to turn  at the time  so if obama were born outside the us and theres no reason to think he was or even reasonable theory as to why he would have been then he would in fact not be a natural born citizenof course he was born in honolulu making him a natural born citizen so the above is merely a historical footnote in immigration and citizenship rules of the mid thcentury wrong  being born in mexico didnt hurt his eligibility because he was white jus sanguinis i think is the term this is a perfect example of how shitty all of our news channels are any real news channel would have told the public this that the birther thing was idiotic and they werent going to mention it again  gt the birther debate was settled  years agoi dunno i wish the debate could be settled with it doesnt even matter if you were born abroad lets give all american citizens the same right to be president if they want whether they were born in the usa or immigrated later natural born its going to be funny when  week before the voting starts mitt goes i give up i cant do this anymore this is what i really stand for then goes off and explains what kind of person he really is and doesnt want to follow the gop machine anymoreeveryone cheers and goes nuts liberals and conservatives alike jump on his wagon and people turn out in droves to vote for the real guy running for president people forget obama even exists because something like this has never happened beforethen he gets elected and becomes that fake person againmost ingenious campaign of all time  the gop has won the country back from the socialists those same communes are currently in a full on war with mexican cartels i cant wait to see romneys face when all of this is brought up in the debates its a different argument though one of the many birther arguments goes like thisif obama were born in kenya he wasnt then he wouldnt have qualifed for citizenship because a his father wasnt a citizen and b his mother didnt meet a minimum ageresidency requirement something like she had to live in the us for  years after turning  and fell short on that requirementproblem is the whole residency thing wasnt in effect when obama was born so its not applicableromney otoh was born to  american citizens in mexico so theres no issue same as mccain being born in the panama canal zone im a little confused my father is american and i received automatic american citizenship when i was born but i always thought i was ineligible for the presidency as i was born in the uk and lived there and around europe for most of my life i was always told you had to be born on american soil and a citizen to be able to be president can someone clarify mitguel romney actually a bunch of these lunatics like to insist that youre only a naturalborn citizen if you were born on american soil to parents who were both citizens themselves its a definition they just made up but they cling to it that would be true today but back in the early s since his mom was under  when she gave birth to him and his father wasnt a citizen it has been disputed among legal scholars whether he would have been eligible if she had given birth outside the us  note i am not a birther im a liberal and am just summarizing a washpo article from may  that came out after the birth certificate was released   i think attacking mitt romney for the actions of his grandfather are in really bad tastealso as far as i know romney has not come out in favor of getting rid of citizenship by birth um actually the president didnt have two american parents and his mom was under the age of  thus its an open question whether he would have been eligible for presidency if he hadnt been born in the us  its pretty unclear from a legal standpoint  but irreleveant since he was born in hawaiiedit  if youre downvoting i can only assume its because you cant read or dont understand  it is not resolved by any means whether obama would be eligible had he been born in kenya or france or somewhere outside the us  there are reasonable ie nontea partytrump minds on both sides of the argument and they agree the question is an open one gtit has to do with my faithit probably does have to do with his faith as in the mormon church would find out that he lied about his income in order to give them a smaller tithe ive seen this argument id think that the leadership in the church could overlook some accounting discrepancies to have their man in the white house i mean the prophets may be false but the profitsare real and big business loves political connections  maybe if it was a small fudge but a significant discrepancy say he was giving not even  of his income would cause serious problems for both mitt and the church  also mitt has a belief problem namely he cant seem to stick to one belief or set of beliefs  if it turns out that mitt hasnt been tithing which is a strict requirements of his faith it will just be another in a long line of things that mitt has professed to believe but not followed through on  add that evangelicals already think he is a heretic and you have the beginning of a fracture in the republican base that could tank his entire candidacy before the convention  and the downside is we would be seeing mitts head on the news even more often the republicans would lose i am a bitter exmormon liberal and honestly it would shock me to find out he hasnt been paying a full tithe i would be less surprised if i found out he ate newborns for breakfast so i think it would be such a blatant hypocrisy that not even utah mormons that would gay marry him would support him   hey mitt heres a simple dodge that makes you look like less of a douche release the returns and say you didnt claim your donations on the tax form because you were happy to pay just  tax the members would find it abhorrent though because a mormon cant go to the temple without paying the full  and if they cant go to the temple they dont get to go to the highest part of heaven and dont get to be with their family or become a god it would be a huge deal to a lot of members if he was cheating way offtopic but its been pointed out recently that only when the church went broke did they suddenly have prophecy requiring the  to go to the temple also temples are conspicuously only built in areas where members have a lot of money having spent the first  years of my life in the mormon church i can tell you that it wouldnt be a big deal to most mormons unless he was cheating by a huge amount which i doubt is the case theres no real guidance on whether that  should be on gross or net income and there have historically existed disagreements on how gross and net income should be calculated for tithing purposes they pretty much leave it up to your conscience to decide what you should be paying  of plus most of them would vote for him anyway simply because hes mormon from a voting standpoint it would be a much bigger deal to nonmormons only in areas where members have a lot of money really  those east german mormons were really richheck those brigham city ut mormons are all just millionaires you obviously dont know where lds temples are built vernalut and richland wa are hardly beverly hills the temples are built where they can serve the members of the church so the church went broke after the us govt seized all church assets hardly a case of poor financial management  lets not forget this would hurt the churches income too  if mitt didnt pay  why should the average mormon do so great pun its not about the leadership its about the regular people would that not be in the tax returns also if he is declaring his church donations it would be clear from the returns if he gave the church the  of course even without the reasons you point out any legitimate church would forgive a devout followerthe thing is that the american people will not so graciously forgive someone who has cheated their church cheating the tax man is one thing and something many would applaud cheating and lying to your church is in a whole other stratosphere  whether romney paid a full tithe is his business and his alone no matter what his tax return shows if he told his bishop he paid a full tithe thats the end of the matter whats on his tax returns however is important well actually its probably pretty unremarkable other than showing stunning wealth but his insistence on not releasing them is what makes this an issuelike ive said several times romneys own campaign vetted several years of potential vp candidates returns they held potential vp candidates to a higher standard than they are using for romney  its a matter of perception trumping reality until we know what the reality of the contents of his returns are the perception is that hes hiding something even if its just something thats politically unpalatable like giving the media reason to run with the fact that hes in the top  in terms of wealth for a news cycle or two gt whether romney paid a full tithe is his business and his alone well in matters of cause and direct effect yes  however the outcome could be that he is a liar to his own church  everybody could decide on his own what that would tell about his character   thats true  someone would no doubt do the calculation and come up with him having only given  or whatever that would speak to his character in the minds of manybut given his released  return i seriously doubt whether this is the case romney doesnt seem like someone for whom tithing is a trialif theres a potential downside related to his charitable contribution id think itd be on the evangelical side with people once again not being sure they want to vote for a mormon who gives so many millions of dollars to his churchmore likely though i suspect that the potential political exposure is in a possibly shadybutnotillegal financial gyrations to pay less in taxes and b showing just how stunningly wealthy romney really is and giving this to the press to chew on for a few news cycles  was after he had already run once and had plenty of time to clean up things  thats why his earlier returns would be more enlightening i really doubt the church would release how much he has paid in tithing though it might be on his returns as charitable donations as an atheist i wouldnt be at all bothered by what that says about his character i recognize that im in an extreme minority though who supports cheaping out on tithing gt as an atheist i wouldnt be at all bothered by what that says about his characterto me it would hes played up his mormon faith regularly in this campaign in fact hes quoted as saying that its one of the most important treasures of my lifeheres a guy thatd cheap out on one of the most important things in his life by his accounts if thats how hed treat an institution that is that close to his heart i shudder to think of how hed treat those hes ambivalent about like for example rape victims youre very right the way i see it im very bothered by the obvious influence his faith has on his decisions its definitely a character flaw that scrooge mcmoneybags doesnt even value the faith thats supposedly so important but i guess im being optimistic in a stupid way the man worships money i can handle and understand that a lot better than religious nut jobs note thats not all people of faith who use their religion to justify every ignorantprejudiced belief they have as a christian it frustrates the hell out of me too i justify my decisions on both a religious and secular level and they rarely conflict       i hate lobbyists detest the twoparty system and have way too many skeletons in my closet to run for president though pleasant thought though  all it tells me is that romney directly funded prop  literally directly well figuratively directly which is the same as literally indirectly well okay true ill settle for funded you are correct  it is romneys personal life  but it is not his business alone  this is a matter between him and his church  the consequences for lying to his church could mean excommunication  thats a big deal  i also agree that whatever is on his tax returns is important  upvotes for you sir or madam   no thats not correct as far as his relationship with the lds church goes being excommunicated for not paying tithing doesnt happen many members dont pay tithing moreoever no church authority his bishop or anyone is going to go back and say hey it looks like you only paid  tithing care to explain each individual who chooses to answer is asked one time whether they have paid a full and honest tithe if they answer yes thats the answer if they lied its between them and god and for someone like romney its never a simple answer anyway  when you run your own business as i have what full and honest means is suddenly a lot more murky so i fully expect romney has routinely paid a full and honest tithe but if he didnt he didnt no one is going to come down on him about that no matter what is in his tax returnthanks for the upvote though fwiw im lds try to be fairminded and am not a supporter of romney for president  but also think that frankly hed likely be better than bush was i find that really interesting  i understand how romney may have a difficult time accurately reporting his income and what amount is correct for a tithe  but i figured the excommunication would be for immoral behavior  abortion transsexual operation attempted murder rape forcible sexual abuse intentionally inflicting serious physical injuries on others adultery fornication homosexual relations child abuse sexual or physical spouse abuse deliberate abandonment of family responsibilities robbery burglary theft sale of illegal drugs fraud perjury or false swearing or apostasy ignoring orders to help the poor and needy etc  but all i really know about lds is from pbs just for my clarification what would happen if they found romney didnt even come close to tithing  like if he only tithed   would he be shamed or punished in any way  thank you for the answer  i love it when reddit provides someone who knows about a topic and they take the time explain it to you  opposed to those people who just tell you to google it happy to help out still fairly new to reddit but ive been online since the early days of usenet so this is fun  again   that first quote is pretty good the second one is a bit off the mark apostasy is generally seen as teaching things as doctrinal not opinion that are contrary to the churchs position after having been asked not to gt just for my clarification what would happen if they found romney didnt even come close to tithing like if he only tithed  would he be shamed or punished in any waythe question doesnt really make sense because no one will find out if he said he paid a full tithe then he did end of story the only ways this is going to come to light is if he went to his bishop about it and during a temple recommend interview if he went to his bishop and said you know after reviewing my records i dont think i really paid a full tithe then the bishop would most likely encourage him to pay the difference but that would be the end of it he might not even do that during a temple recommend interview held once every two years for lds members who want to attend the temple which is completely separate from attending weekly church meetings hed be asked among other questions if he was a full tithepayer if he said yes then its yes no checking up or whatever  bishops are held to a very strict standard to let people answer their own questions and bear the consequences with god if theyre lying if he said no then he might not be able to attend the temple until he got it worked out but thats itanything like this is treated totally and completely confidentially so there is no public interaction shaming etc in any way you dont know who is paying tithing who is having marriage troubles who is attending the temple who nips a drink now and then etc its just not anyone elses business even when someone has been excommunicated for something like adultery we try to keep it very confidential its not seen as a punishment and has no social aspect gtlike ive said several times romneys own campaign vetted several years of potential vp candidates returns they held potential vp candidates to a higher standard than they are using for romneyalso remember romney was vetted as a vp candidate in  john mccains people looked at a significant amount of romneys tax returns i think it was  years and he picked sarah palin gtwhether romney paid a full tithe is his business and his alone no matter what his tax return shows if he told his bishop he paid a full tithe thats the end of the matteri dont think this is true  mormons have told me that their church leaders whatever the leader of the ward is called will actually look over your financial records to make sure youre paying the correct tithe  you arent allowed to just put in what you think you owe they demand to see your records to make sure gt mormons have told me that their church leaders whatever the leader of the ward is called will actually look over your financial records to make sure youre paying the correct tithe you arent allowed to just put in what you think you owe they demand to see your records to make surei cant imagine where youre getting that from i can tell you with  assurance that that is absolutely not the case first not every lds church member pays tithing if they dont they dont its completely voluntary and entirely confidential we dont pass the plate or anythingthen at the end of the year you can sign up for whats called tithing settlement  but again only if you want to no one checks up on whether you have or not thats a meeting with you and usually your family and the bishop he hands you a printout of how much you paid in tithing and other offerings that year and asks are you a full tithepayer you say yes or no or whatever else you want   thats it the bishop does not and is not allowed to look over your financial records or anything beyond that one question im sure for any lds bishops who might be on reddit the idea of poring over ward members financial records to make sure they paid enough would be enough to make them cry they have enough work to do already people are responsible for their own tithing its what a mormon coworker told me once well its flat wrong you either misremembered your coworker was pulling your leg or something else was going on but what ive described above is what happens what you stated above is not remotely accurate not soif the mormon church were to find out he was less than truthful regarding his tithe he could lose his temple recommend that is a huge deal amongst the hardcore  no baptizing dead relatives no ceremonies officially consecrated and so are not binding in the afterlife etc gt if he told his bishop he paid a full tithe thats the end of the matter not to the church if hes lying  the candidates were vetted bc of extreme scrutiny that would surely be applied to this if you have tax issues as in irs had an issue w you it should sink you geithner excluded yep so why doesnt this same level of scrutiny apply to romney himself if one of his vp candidates had said i looked over the past few years of my returns and theyre all okay do you think his camp would have accepted that why should we accept anything less romneys returns are the only real romney left  hes been on both sides of every  major issue will the real willard stand up mitt is a bishop yeeessss hes not serving as one which means he has one and did even when he was stake president hes not serving as one source there are rumors that say mitt is looked upon as a prophet and a chosen president in some mormon circles thats just completely bogus romney served as a bishop  and later stake president  a stake is somewhat like a catholic diocese with each ward overseen by a bishop like a parish see i dont know what some mormon circles youre talking about but theyre certainly small fringe circles if they exist at all  youre not a bishop forever youre called you serve youre released romney was a bishop in the s then he was a stake president until  he was released when he ran for senate released from what his magic underwear wtf thats just how mormons talk about church positions youre called by a higherup to take some position you serve in that position and when they want to give you another job or give someone else your job youre released so everything is just hearsay how do we know mitt isnt considered a prophet my family is mormon and i was raised as a mormon i wouldnt doubt for one second that if romney lied about paying a full tithe and it got out a significant portion of the lds vote would not go to romney there are approx  million members so that is another possible threat towards romney  what percentage are in utah though  its not like he is losing that state anyway i married into a mormon family i was very surprised to find out the family has a lukewarm view of him  theyll still vote for him but its really just because hes not obama  former mormon here now atheist and i concur it would piss a lot of them off since paying full tithe is considered a sacred duty i know people who go without a lot because they pay their full  i even paid full tithing on my allowance as a kid and it came up in our bishop interviews the bishops of each ward or congregation interview all baptized members regularly  like once a month  and ask them questions to determine if they are living righteously romney would actually lose his temple worthiness which is a really big deal and he would be ineligible for leadership callings just the fact that hes a previous stake president would be a scandal if it shows he skimped on his tithes the church takes its money seriously  but then again they might like the publicity and bragging rights of having the first morman president ever please tell me that you escaped the cult safely this is my theory too if hes enough of an an asshole to avoid paying taxes through gods knows how many loopholes i fucking guarantee you he doesnt tithe based on his actual income i actually think it might be the other way around  he paid full tithe on all his income because god sees right through borders tax havens shelters swiss bank accounts etc the federal government on the other hand  exmormon here i dont doubt the sincerity of his faith so it makes no sense that he would stiff the church on tithing you cant pull a fast one on the lord after all no the tithing thing is a red herring that would be the least damaging of all potential taxrelated issues non mormon voters couldnt give less of a fuck about his tithing and the mormon church isnt about to go around bad mouthing one of their most powerful members  its one or more of a couple of things  he had a swiss account and took part in the irs amnesty which would mean he had actually committed a tax felony that would disqualify him for office  he has investments in concerns that run directly counter to his professed political positions eg the company that disposes of aborted fetuses  he actually didnt pay at least  in one of those years most likely  when the crash has taken a toll on everyone including boohoo those who ended up with a couple hundred million less than they would have had otherwise hes got more than one wife  hes not from earth but only lives here to avoid paying taxes on klobotu is he writing off mileage that must be a hell of a credit i thought it was kolob not a mormon kolokolobastanstanstan dum dum dum dum dum to be fair its a socialist nightmare planet with insane tax rates    he was sent back from the future to save john conner i just realized that if someone creates a fake tax return with all of these combined it would be so outlandish that poes law would kick in and people would think it was real thus forcing romney to release his real tax returnsyou had me loling at the multiple wives he is a mormon so its certainly a possibility gt he had a swiss account and took part in the irs amnesty which would mean he had actually committed a tax felony that would disqualify him for officebut he wouldnt have been convicted of a felony so maybe not as automatic of a disqualifier as you think point taken  is almost a guarantee iirc he had carried losses on the  filing he released hed only have those if there was no point in applying them in  im prepared to be downvoted and corrected by accountants just stating what i read it depends on what type of loss carryforward it was  some losses cant be applied to other types of income  there are also limits on how much loss you can claim each year depending on source and your agi i think number  is most likely people seem to forget that this guys base doesnt like the way government spends money and i doubt having offshore accounts or anything like that would lose him a very large chunk of votes i think hed lose votes from white working class voters who lean romney because of vague racismthere are a lot of these  they dont like romney very much but they will vote for him because hes not the other like obama is  once the cat is out of the bag theyll either stay home or go the other way i think this is quite silly racism isnt nearly as prevalent as you think it mostly exists in the media i have literally not heard anyone make a racist remark since i was a child and i live in a white trash town of course there are always racists but i have a feeling most people who are racist already hate liberals anyway and a tax return is not going to change their minds  oh racism is exactly as prevalent as i thinkwe have a nice little white power movement going here and every so often you find their flyers in bathrooms of the diverocker bars  a group of them thought they had found a home in my local watering hole and i was encouraged to leave them be as they werent being overt most of the time and a lot of people didnt want any trouble  then the seig heils started one night and me and a couple of buddies chased them out  they havent been back but i see them around  these arent random little fucktards imitating what they see on tv but actual footsoldiers of the aryan nationsin the more working class bars there is an undercurrent of racism that permeates everything  these people hate obama and use various racial epithets to describe him  many of these people voted for clinton twicethere are racists in my own family  they dont think they are and only use derogatory terms when they slip up but it is there boiling under the surface  they really enjoy working watermelon into political discussions  all birthers one can be quite racist and never use the word nigger or beaner or whatever  most racists have learned to only use those terms amongst themselvesi find it amusing that you say you havent heard a racist remark since you were a kid and then use the term white trash  you do realize that is a discriminatory term right  and you also know that it isnt just poor white people trash as you call them who are racists right to be pedanticgt he had a swiss account and took part in the irs amnesty which would mean he had actually committed a tax felony that would disqualify him for officehe would only lose eligibility if he were convicted of a felony if he took part of the amnesty program he would not be a convicted felon the amnesty program guaranteed no prosecution of felony tax evasion or other crimes in return for paying interest and penalties in effect the irs plea bargained the the felony away in exchange for a small finei doubt that distinction would provide any comfort to the american people however yeah multiple wives shows up all the time on tax forms thats how the irs got me um if he has more than one wife how would that show up on his tax return  its not like the irs would approve a return trying to claim multiple wives as dependentsspouses he couldnt have more than one wife its not like hes a mormon or anything and that would in no way alienate most of the religious rightsarcasm also he may have paid his taxes in california while registered to vote in massachusetts he registered in ma one year so he could vote in the ted kennedy special election and listed the basement of their sons unfinished house as a primary residenceif so that is also a felony  mitt could be a convicted murderer rapist pedophile and cannibal and it wouldnt disqualify him for office only if he was impeached by the senate or participated in a rebellion against the united states would disqualify him or if he was a robot since that would not fulfill the natural born citizen requirement  why would having committed a tax felony disqualify one from office any felony conviction will disqualify you from running for public office   could you provide a source for that i was unable to verify that the a felony disqualifies one from running for president and according to factcheckorg a felon can run for office looks like youre right so i stand corrected i cant find anything that indicates that a convicted felon is barred from serving as president  the question remains whether he would actually be electable if accusedtriedconvicted but none of those would disqualify him theres also speculation that he made more money than he disclosed to the mormon church mormons are required to tithe at least  of their earnings and if he lied to them about his income all hell would seriously break loose mormons dont fuck around when it comes to tithing   polygamy wouldnt show up in his tax records you cant have multiple spouses listed its just not possible with current irs forms i think his taxes are going to be squeaky clean and hes just playing obama  also he made an obscene amount of passive money and doesnt want those figures thrown out there because they show how rich and out of touch he is i dont get the tithing aspect  no one cares if mitt donated every cent to the mormon church and if it turns out he gave nothing hes still not losing the mormon vote i figure its an appeal to the religious base hoping to connect with the sanctity of religion and a persons faith narrative mitts religion is money so i can see why hed think that would appeal to the religious crowd yes he is a deacon in the church of materialism i would be ashamed if he claimed to be part of my religion and i would move to have him kicked out  gt church of martialismcan bruce lee be canonized as a saint please george bush should too  im sure that to every mormon out there with negligible exceptions even getting a really bad mormon into the white house is better than not getting a mormon into the white house harry reids a helluva an exception of mormons support obama according to this gallup poll  well it wont matter much because hes certainly winning utah idaho and probably nevada anyway  but a ton of mormons cant stand mitt the mormons take tithing very seriously he would probably be excommunicated or whatever the mormon version of that is demormonizedsomething like that would not only get a lot of press it would remind everyone about the magic underwear and that romney thinks jesus lived in america  i wouldnt be so sure  if hes required to tithe but doesnt and all the rest of them do wont they resent him  or even punish him in some way within the church has he ever used his faith as an excuse not to release them yep thanks i honestly hadnt seen that one of the comments on the articleheaven the ultimate offshore account its particularly amazing given his fathers stance on the subject when he was running  the fact that his father started the tradition is just incredibly delicious irony i just want to see his  return see if he did in fact turn himself in with that amnesty program for not paying on his swiss accounts  thats the only thing i can think of that he would be so hard up on hiding from us it isnt mandatorywhat you going to vote for him if he doesthen he loses nothing for not showing and gains a lot im not my daddy mitt mitts a practicing morman i thought he was a devout follower of money you heard his wife  quit harassing them  tax evasion is their private business  tax returns  birth certificategod i hate politics  why are these stupid issues at the forefront when theres so many more important things to talk about  and i dont mean ryans px routine either  romney to release  tax return by october  yeah i already heard that turkish  is the important one if he really wants to quell this furor so brave well he did provide the mandatory  years  im using the same measuring stick that the repubs have used over the last few years show us what we want as proof or everything else is just a ruse or a conniving grasp for power  or it aint fine they both both have glaring issues as to why imo they should not be aloud to run for office however we will continue to see the dribble from the media that confuses the masses people will keep arguing for one guy or the other and one will be voted in wash rinse repeat  as emptywheel noted recently mitt wants to claim that his tithing effectively makes his tax rate in excess of  but he doesnt want to show the proof of this assertion its always a safe assumption that mitt is full of shit romney and hobbes his adviser has already said he will release this years as soon as they come back october regardless when he does im just waiting with popcorn in hand for a ignorant public outcry as to why he pays so littlemitt romney currently has no real job he makes the majority of his money through investments and guess what you dont have to pay as much taxes on gains through investments as you do in other forms of personal income so dont go crucify the man for breaking zero lawsif youre so concerned start investing yourself  gt  your fucking tax returns to be released just like every other presidential candidate has since your father made it a campaign practicei think he should release them but this is not true  mccain only released two  reagan only released one when he ran the first timeheresa politifact link showing this is the case but it is also pretty easily verifiable elsewhere if you want a different source after their medicare lie of the year fiasco this isnt true not every candidate has released more than mitt hasnt romney already released his tax returns   well said exactly so because people are racist and keep questioning obama because he is black its okay to keep attacking him  and mitt has not released his tax returns yet people keep asking for that why do you want them would it change your vote if he gave them  nope but it might change someone elses not true plenty of past presidential candidates only released a few years of tax returnsin fact the act of releasing tax returns as a presidential candidate is a relatively new traditionnot saying romney shouldnt but correcting your statement oh my god you just entered the taxreturner movement you arent a rational voter you sound pretty angry calm down brah half the problem is that most of the voters in the republican party lack any rational thought gtyou know what we all have been asking for though mitt your fucking tax returns to be released just like every other presidential candidate hasyep all we want is obamas birth certificate firstgoose meet gander gt yep all we want is obamas birth certificate firsthe gave it to you but your just going to make some excuse that it isnt good enough or something because thats what birthers do ignore evidence here is the evidence barack obama produced two copies of what he claimed was his birth certificate along with one copy of what he claimed was his selective service declearation the state of hawaii has never released anything citing absurd privacy rules  incidentally the officials in hawaii responsible for birth certificates are both democrat party officials obamas first attempt was a short form birth certificiate when people pointed out that could easily be forged with microsoft word obama was subsequently forced to release a second document  a purported copy of longform birth certificate this document was not given to the press by barack obama himself hes never been photographed touching this document it was given to the press by unnamed campaign officials that the media refuses to identify police investigated these documents they concluded that both the alleged copy of the longform birth certificate and the selective service declaration were likely forgeries no member of the media has taken any either still or moving pictures of barack obamas original birth certificate  because hawaii democrats refuse to allow it  even though barack obama claims hes released a copy of that document and so there can be no claim of privacy this joins evidence of the campaign and candidate hiding other documents barack obamas transcripts from colleges he claims to have attended but cannot prove he attended and where neither students nor professors remember him attendingthis is evidence you may not believe this is compelling evidence but there is certainly enough evidence here for any reasonable person to entertain doubts about whether or not barack obama is truly an american citizen or whether in the past he has falsely claimed to be a foreigner in order to fraudulently obtain benefits he was not entitled to making him a common criminal gt this is evidenceno it isnt its your accusation and conjecture at least you and romney now have more in common birthers were you this upset when john mccain released two years of tax returns just like mittens are any laws being broken it might not be the most transparent thing but obama hasnt had the best track record as president either  his father didnt make it a practice his father just happened to release his tax returnsedit not sure about the downvotes did mitts father actually found the notion of politicians releasing their tax returns he paid  tax last year according to his returns which amounts to  million dollars now im not saying that he isnt taking advantage of tax loopholes which he clearly is but jesus christ people if you had to pay out  million dollars every year you would be a republican too who cares what taxes he paid who cares whether obama was born in the us neither of those issues should ever be the criteria upon which a rational voter casts his saythe electorate are hung up on such frippery  as always  id say wanting to know what he paid is pretty legitimate since it will go to show if he is a person willing to help out the good of the country by paying his share or if he is a self centered person who would rather keep everything to himself with the expense of others when trying to determine a leader of a country thats probably important though the where he was born issue is pretty ridiculous since you cant even run if you werent eligible to begin with  i think it would be wiser to scrutinise his proposed policies when attempting to discern his potential actions as president  also dont conflate paying taxes with helping people its tax money that goes towards blowing up innocent people overseas  infact more of it is spent on this than on any of the social programs that i am supposing you support very true in the military spending being way over the top at least in my and lots of other peoples opinions and i was thinking more of having a large enough budget to start balancing deficit so in essence my point still stands but i totally agree with you too  a large enough budget to start balancing deficit i dont understand this can you please explain  meant it as the spending is way larger than budget if we have a larger budget from tax revenue we can at least start reducing the amount of debt with spending cuts in appropriate places too of course sorry i suck at explaining my thoughts  no thats fine i understood i think that the only mainstream candidate i could have ever really gotten behind was ron paul as he was committed to the total evisceration of americas gluttonous miltary budget gt who cares what taxes he paidthe people who vote in an election where the rhetoric is that the superwealthy are unduly burdened by taxes and thus we must cut them at the expense of fewer social services and higher taxes on the nonsuperwealthy  the people who are considering voting for the guy who pushes that rhetoric struggling to find a reason why anyone gives a flying fuck about his tax returns why the fuck are his tax returns a more important issue for you nutjobs to talk about than the terrible economy and jobs market how are you talking about tax returns instead how because tax rates for rich people are linked incredibly closely to the economy  sorry if you were being sarcastic i honestly couldnt tell because if people saw mitts taxes they would realize that what he pays in taxes is much less than the favors his businesses gets back from governmentas with all big business ersreagans welfare queens driving cadillacs are nothing compared to government teet sucklers like mittedit if what i say is not true then mitt is welcome to provide the information to disprove it his refusal to do so opens him up to my type of criticism actually reagans welfare queens driving cadillacs was a lie constructed by the heritage foundation and told by every single republican politician often enough and loudly enough that they fooled us allit was never legal and more the the point it never ever happened they made it up to get the working class to hate the poor for taking advantage of the system designed to help them and by extension taking advantage of the working class people that paid into that systemit was one of the first forays of the republicans into the land of the big lie and it was so successful that they now think that a big enough lie can give them all the power and money there is to be had in the us  to see if he took part in amnesty for tax cheats in   and that i believe is the most likely bit of data wed find personally i dont like that he calls tithing giving to charity  prop  funding isnt charity it matters because what little we have seen already indicates that this guy uses perfectly legal loopholes to get out of paying his fair share to the government that he wants to run  the dixie chicks were crucified by this countrys conservatives and media elite as traitors for having the temerity to say that they were ashamed the president was from texas  how many liberals were call traitors during the bush administration for voicing opinions against an unnecessary war  but you know what  im perfectly fine with calling people traitors who claim to love this country but send their money out to swiss banks and the cayman islands because they cant stand having to pay up the same percentage of their money that the little people have to pay upand this is the guy who claims he wants to save medicarejust as soon as he can starve the federal government of all resources both personally and through the policies hed enactso yes i want to see what else he has to hide  it goes to character his entire platform is based off of his business experience his tax returns directly represents his history as a business man and investor ding   we have a winner im not an american but im pretty sure its because they dont want a dude with sketchy tax returns being in charge of the already shaky economy funny your frustration is the same thing ive felt over the last  years as republicans and supporters constantly brought up the show us his birth certificate bullshit edit even after the birth certificate was provided i might add dont you realize that the argument is only valid when it isnt turned on them i actually would like to be arguing more relevant points but the repubs have set the tone in political discourse over the last few races ive witnessed how effective hammering away at whatever seems to get traction can be and the whole well if he didnt have something to hide hed show it has been pounded into the american mentality itd be unwise to not use that to our advantage now imho i suggest finding friends all over the political spectrum it diversified my understanding of multiple viewpoints and is a lot easier than arguing with the ones over the internet ive found that although im open to having my mind changed when confronted with a valid argument or unknown truth many are not i guess my experiences growing up not only gave me a healthy suspicion of authority but also taught me that what i thought was undeniably truth was in fact just fiction so i should be aware of this tendency many ive encountered do not have this flexibility in thinking and will cling to whatever narrative they have created even in the face of undeniable proof  couldnt have said that better myself sir gt strugglingyou keep at it son youll get it somedayheres a few clues romney talks a whole lot about his business experience being the key thing that can turn around the economy unfortunately he doesnt want to talk about bain nor how his finances tax returns are done furthermore his economic plans include a whole bunch of tax cuts for the very wealthy so the issues of taxes is kind of a big deal and if its shown that his tax cuts would basically be a big handjob to himself we already know if ryan had his budget passed romney would be paying less than  then voters might want to know that and have that information when they vote well one really big reason is the entire republican economic platform is that all we really need is to help the ultra rich with tax breaks cuz theyre the job creators and well be great his tax returns would show how incredibly bullshit that platform is and how incredibly bullshit the tax code is for the ultrarichanother reason is that mitt is already known to be a liar about his taxes in the past which already makes whatever he says suspect it would shine some light on his personal character which might just be a good thing when it comes to someone you might hand the keys of a nation to because his tax returns are going to tell me exactly what his vision of tax reform is going to be because if he is paying  taxes or even less and still talking about cutting taxes the republican platform i know damn well that under a romney presidency the super rich will have their taxes cut further while the middle class and the poor have to expect trickle down from the job creators  also isnt the percentage for his income supposed to be something like  if so it already means hes cut that in half   is for suckers who work for their money earning a salary from their employers if you mainly have investment income from capital gains you rarely pay over  hence the argument of what warren buffet pays versus his secretary we dont value work as much as investment in this country  well that sucks  because maybe if rich assholes like him would pay their fucking taxes then maybe the middle and lower classes wouldnt be getting squeezed so hard maybe the deficit which republicans claim to be all about fixing whenever a democrat is in office wouldnt be quite so large do you get it yet need any other painfully obvious things explained to you are you calling mitts dad a nutjob he wants to cut taxes on rich americans  he is a rich american if we look at his taxes and see he pays lt it is going to make it fairly obvious that the rich do not need any more tax cuts it could blow a huge hole in his entire economic plan  nut jobs thanks call it tradition we americans are silly like that  because romney wont do anything to fix the economy or jobs market a president does not have the ability to fix in one term an economic crisis that has been brewing for decades the only ways to have a large impact would be to spend lots of money which both bush and obama did or to slash taxes both of which would increase the deficit im guessing youre against that too keep struggling little grasshopper  you will figure it out one of these days because is will show if he is honest or not thats really the only reason i care but you are right it is bing used to ignore way more important issues like the economy cutting military spending us imperialism but neither candidates wants to talk about this because we wont like what we hear  come obama you you want itno ones asked tax returns or rather people said they wanted to see my tax returns so i released my tax returns people said they wanted to see my birth certificate so i released by birth certificate i believe the american people have a fundamental right to information about people running for elected office and i have behaved in a manner consistent with that belief of course people also asked for his college transcripts and obama didnt release those so maybe that wouldnt be such a good speech to make i dont get the college transcripts anyway that one seems like a oh damn  he released everything we asked for well find something else why does obama refuse to release his xbox live gamerscore the people have a right to know if obama is noob or lt today its a joke but in the near future i thought about this recently because of social networking we will probably know everything that happened in the life of the president  years from now from the time he was in high school until he is campaigning every single picture status update tweet etc can and probably will be scrutinized by the public after its released by wikileaks or anonymous or whatever exists in the future beware what you post you schmuck interns who hope to one day run this country farther into the ground maybe when we know every little detail about eveyones life well realize how trivial bullshit from decades ago is and wont care any oh who am i kidding campaigns in the future will all be about who ate more crayons in kindergarten i consider myself a real patriot and as it was my patriotic duty i ate fifty red white and blue crayons  my opponent only ate communist red and sickle yellow crayons as a child i fear and expect this future  it already happened hillary clinton used a kindergarten essay against the president presidential candidate aiden combover says hes the man to run this country but in a reddit post from  he said he ejaculated into a shoebox for years and tried to light it on fire does that sound presidential to youpaid for by isabelle pantsuit for a better america will they find out i was a spawncamper in quake  yes im oldthat seals it im never running for any public office i couldnt handle that kind of disgrace man id so lose the vote of the grocery store i worked at for  years youll never be president with an outlook like that youll lose the entire grocery store industrys vote unless you hire a spin team to make it more about policy and how they stacked the displays so that middle amurrika can concur with you that the pickle jars are stacked too damn high grocery stores cant vote in the us unless its a corporation of course they are considered humans now but imagine a world where everyone has that level of cached dirt  thats pretty scary presidency is already so much of a popularity contest itll be horrible to have candidates not elected because they called some random person a faggot on facebook or posted a drunken tweet  years agogod forbid someone change their opinion about say gay marriage in those  years theyll become a waffler that could really go two ways though either we scrutinize every misstep breaking president seen in college with a beer and experimenting during a game of spin the bottle on facebook pictures released by the opposition this morning or we come to the simple realization that were all human after all and can move past petty bullshit id like to think of myself as somewhat of an optimist gt we scrutinize every misstep breaking president seen in college with a beer and experimenting during a game of spin the bottle on facebook pictures released by the opposition this morningsorry to crush your optimism but this is already what happens yes and no im sure anyone wishing to run for a public office might hire a pr representative to moderate their facebook page and remove any potentially compromising posts i know i would if i were in the same position as im sure a potential presidential candidate would t want people digging back in his history and dragging up a post from high school along the lines of whoo fucked up blowing up mailboxes yolooo mofos ah but we also have things like webarchiveorg and such to take a look at the past history of any pageadmittedly ive never tried that with something like facebook but theoretically something of that sort could be possible if someone running for public office tried that in the future report every potential  president already unelectable due to facebook why is this not upvoted more  its totally true  frighteningly true how the hell can i run for office now there are already people that purposely record every day of their lives extreme life loggers live every day with a stopmotion camera on their person take detailed notes and make extensive use of social networking the point of it all being to one day build a digital recreation of that persons life and memories for use in oldage or even to implant into a new body one day everyones life will be on file like this  presidentially written naruto fanfictionawesome further the day a schmuck intern runs the country farther into the day will be a day of days day days funny some people have protested the rise of social media because its one more way for them to spy on us but in a few decades all of them will be us too thanks for the interesting thought i was at my shitty parking booth job today contemplating how fucked up it is that im a college grad working this shitty job in this shitty michigan economy when all of a sudden i hear sirens and look over to see a full scale secret service motorcade with mitt romney in tow i could make out that tacky ass hairdo from my booth i immediately thought this dude is on his way to say some stupid shit  or she  no people who are able to become president have the means of deleting or changing their social networking history in their favour idiocracy directors cut go away baten   lol that movie cracked me up youre not allowed to talk about idiocracy you dont really understand itedit to the people downvoting this was a reference to thispost that made it to the front page today we learn the dark secret that obama only plays wii  i laughed at that  but really what league is obama in stacraft   i dont want some goldie with garbage macro making decisions not to mention only the opinions of people in high masters actually matter in foreign policy because they have to deal with koreans so you are saying that obama would crumble in the face of communist north korea on taldarim altar le   im just saying he cant defend america from the zerg rush coming over the nksk dmz its a bit different there and dare i say inefficient pfft no good third on taldarim nk zergs would get owned by our mighty mech they have to lose to koreans north koreans they still havent built any new scvs by the  minute mark and are relying on nukes without cloak south koreans have a solid contain on their main ramp  this is what i keep telling everyone why have the reins of power not been ceded to me yet i have more top  finishes than the entire state department this is pure gold nope gm obviously way beyond gold campaign shirtmy president has bermicro by this logic only koreans should be allowed to run well bush had solid production macro but saced too many workers but he relied on the floating resources clinton left after seeing how much reaganbush built up production facilities obamas micro with a handful of seals against bin laden proves that we can drone up if hes reelected or we rely on trying to macro with no economy if romney takes the election probably rushing mutas he totally pwns noobz on cod all nite long bros  sippin code red and such sipping fapple hitler did nothing wrong im not sure how i feel about this meme hitler isnt even real its just a name of a soda maybe hes a camper we know

dubstep erryday wubwubwubwubwooooooo ban this sick filth after analyzing the recently released gaming records we have found that in counter strike obama played terrorist  of the time what does this say we dont know you decide how often does he spawn with the bomb that tells the true story how much of a fag is obama and just exactly how many underage boys have slept with his mother hmmmmm i just diedbahaha you got a downvote for not contributing anything useful but i scrolled down just to find someone who laughed as hard as i did here seriously hilarious comment up there you deserve all the

lol whuz up but in the truest and original form of the word i laughed the fuck out loud so loud at this thank you  rock chalk  fellow jayhawk here i would like to think there is some awesome secret service agent out there helping the president with his gamerscore rick santorum got a millions points in temple runnever before had i so motivated to beat someones high score in anything i demand his release of ssn to prove his citizenship credit card number as proof of living in the us oh  and also his  mothers maiden name  umm to prove his american heritage  gonna need a billing address too for like more verification or something quick google search brings up obamas moms maiden name is dunham oh sure thats what liberal google would say what is the obama campaign hiding tonight on fox obama declares war on middle names  and his credit card so we can uh verify itedit really kids thats a joke from the crazy depths of the breitbart comments section it appears that the presidents college transcripts will show that he was a foreign exchange student thereby confirming that the released birth certificate was a fake  this is why obama is spending millions of dollars to keep it hidden   ughhhhhh imagine the amount of effort it takes to come up with this nonsense for example did you know all the gun regulations that obama never implemented in his first term like the nra said he would is just a ruse to get him elected again so that he can take guns away in his second term according to the nra  im sure that the resultant increase in ammunition and firearm prices was just a happy coincidence for those in the nra who happen to purvey such merchandise im a liberal and me no likey guns  not sure what context youre using this in but thats certainly the misnomer that a lot of people used to manipulate the firearm and ammunition market  i miss cheap ammo i am a librul who does i am a liberal and i like guns  been shooting since i was eight  im a good shot too yes first they had to find one of them who actually went to college and knew about transcripts the nra is a terrorist organization this falls firmly under occams razor if obamas got something to hide on his transcript its either  grades that without his ethnicity wouldnt have allowed him admission to harvard law or  he took classes that put him under some scrutiny eg columbias how to run a liberal presidency  where he got a b  or  obama doesnt need to give in to these birther morons who think his transcript will prove he was a foreign exchange student if he releases his transcript theyll just claim its fake and demand him to release yet another document they demanded his long form birth certificate and he released it  and it did absolutely nothing to satisfy the birthers he was also gay married to a pakistani muslim at the same time according to the same sourcesah andrew  cocaine was a hell of a drug wasnt it yes and until  his lit agencys bio said he was born in kenya and raised in hawaii and indonesia you do realize that being a citizen has more to do with your parents than the country you are  born in right  ie his mother was an american citizen gave birth to him therefor he is an american citizen  if he was born in another country that would mean he would have dual citizenship  likely till he turned  i wouldnt know how to release my college transcripts if i wanted to i dont have them locked in a desk drawer or anything you know how you pay a college a shit load of money yeah they do more than pay football coaches they actually hold on to your records and all you have to do is ask for them and usually give hem more money breaking fox news obama wastes taxpayer money to selfishly obtain useless college transcripts we can only assume so that he can edit them to make himself seem like a fantastic student yup a president with a hundred million dollar company shouldnt waste his cash on a damn  transcript gtyeah they do more than pay football coaches what they do since when contact your college and theyll happily take your money and send a certified copy to whatever press outfit you want depends on the school where i graduated they would happily send out your transcript to whoever you want as many times as you wanted no charge one of the odd bits of charity from an organization that otherwise tried to nickelanddime me at every step yeah and the moment you do that all the people demanding the transcripts will say theyre fake generally you do it the same way obama released his birth certificate  you provide copies to the press you can probably download a form go on your schools website to request an official copy  they keep records of their students going way back and know sometimes alumni need proof of their degree for employment continued education or what have you youd uh get them from your college to be fair the college transcripts were a big issue with bush jr and john kerryiirc john kerry didnt release his transcripts until after he lost the election and they showed he had basically precisely the same performance at yale as bush even though the kerry campaign tried to insinuate bush was a dullard and kerry was an intellectual  kerry got a d in political science tooso relevant or not the issue of college transcripts precedes obama  its not an issue that was just pulled at random bush didnt release his transcripts they were leaked kerrys campaign didnt insinuate that bush was a dullard by  everyone sensible enough knew bush was incompetent but karl rove swiftboated a guy who actually served in vietnam and that got us  more yrs of unprecedented stupidity with an epic financial collapse at the end i never said bush released his transcripts its important to note the distinction though people assume bush released his transcripts and try to use that as a precedent that obama should follow presidents dont have to release their transcripts of course presidents dont have to release their transcripts just as they dont have to release several years of tax records or medical records precedents for presidents  but political science is ez sauce as a course at this point i think i might prefer someone who got a bad grade in political science yeah it seems dumb to me too i think theyre just hoping that more information will be enough to find a crack they can find a wedge in though i hardly think his college transcript would contain anything worse than his first autobiography did the reason obamas rivals want to see his transcripts is so they can say he only got where he did because of affirmative action which is basically racism amirite isnt that proof that affirmative action worked thenwhy would they want that to show that he wasnt actually qualified to go to columbia and harvard and that he got in by displacing more qualified white people he was president of the harvard law review in law school and a big stink was made when it was revealed that the harvard law review had racial quotas while obama was there to be fair if i had a fill a quota i dont think president would be the position id fill it with racial quotaat least one black president of harvard law review think of how well those more qualified guys would have done in the world they surely would have become president of the entire western hemisphere didnt ryan only get to where he is because he had social securitywelfare to pay his way through college and stuff but paul ryan is white my guess he probably took some course about marx at some point and knows exactly how fox news will latch onto that no candidate has ever released their college transcripts the fact that some crazies are asking obama for says absolutely nothing about obama and everything about how crazy these right wing nutjobs are i dunno i thought bush ii did maybe that was after being elected though or maybe when he ran for governor not intentionallygt the common response to the points im raising here usually boils down to mentioning the fact that the new yorker managed to get its hands on george w bushs yale transcripts during the  campaign  they didnt get them from the bush campaign and technically whoever released them was violating federal laws regarding the privacy of education records several months later the washington post managed to get its hands on al gores education records again without the consent of the campaign and in apparent violation of federal law supposedly these transcripts were meant to show that bush was a lackluster student in college although what we actually saw was that bushs grades werent all that different than gores and roughly equivalent to john kerrys who authorized the release of his transcripts after the  electionit looks like only john kerry has volunteered his college transcript for everyone else someone broke the law in order to make it publicone funny thing i found is it seems some republicans are wanting romney to release his tax returns in exchange for obama to release his college transcripts can anyone make sense of this obama already released his tax returns going years back wouldnt a fair exchange be for romney to release his college transcripts if obama releases his or for romney to release his tax returns since obama released his except they arent this whole section is based purely off of a what i was assuming is half joking comment do did they even have courses about marx  at a place like harvard they did at my crappy little state college so i dont know why they wouldnt at an ivy league school because barry soetoro  hes hiding the c he got in interpretive dance it will prove that he was registered as a foreign student and is therefore kenyan i bet he doesnt even have a social security number or a bank account  the voting public has a right to know the only reason that people bring up the transcripts is because they dont believe that his reported education is real because of course he wasnt born in america  it should be dismissed as the same absurdity  because democrats tried to make a big deal about how george w bushs transcripts showed that he was dumb  then it turned out his gpa was slightly higher than john kerrys if he released college transcripts theyd be asking for medical records funny thing with obamas college record is that its already been reported that both president obama and michelle obama graduated magna cum laude from harvardso what exactly are they trying to see  what classes he took  maybe if theres a socialism course tucked away there somewhere i dont get it s they want to know if he got into college with the aid of affirmative action and if he did wouldnt that be a sign that affirmative action worked because he clearly was successful once he got into college its like the hunt for the missing link once we have evidence of its existence it doesnt matter and we just point to the next missing linksomewhat relevant terribly recorded futurama clip im confused with that why do people want to see that im also confused why he hasnt released it confusion all around someone who got into harvard law school and became a constitutional law professor at uchicago most likely had perfect grades anyways i dont believe the follow but it is the argument for them to be releasedhe got into university of chicago and harvard being from some no name family from hawaii and due to this fact he may have lied on his applications about his citizenship  by seeing his gradesapplications it would clear any of this up but like i said above i think its just another bullshit argument its not about his transcripts directlythe thought is currently that obama was a foreign exchange student and got scholarships for being one the actually want his college financial records and contend that no one from the schools he went to remember him ever being enrolleddont believe me google it for yourself i feel braincells shrivel and die whenever i run across one of those sites its my understanding that people who want the transcripts want to see if he applied as an international student or as an american citizen  some are birthers other because they believe he was gaming the system well at first glance yes  however there is a guy who went to columbia and shared a major with obama but claims he never saw obama  he formulated a theory that obama got into columbia and harvard as a foreign exchange student who made subpar grades oh no some professor doesnt remember him it must be a conspiracy that seems like pretty weak sauce a classmate  i dont know how you got professor from what i said but i guess i just dont understand how some people are functionally illiterate   sorry  it was someone elses post that said a professor yours  is jut dumber i mean  some guy said he doesnt remember obama its a conspiracy some guy said he and everyone else he knew didnt know obama  i dont even care  either way but they make a legitimate argument the fact that no one remembers him from columbia seems a bit shady especially the fact that professors he said taught him remember nothing of himfor  years i taught political history diplomatic history and one of the pioneering courses on presidential history and every future politician of note who went through columbia in those years took one or more of my classes  every one that is except barack obama henry franklin graff although barack obama may not have been particularly social or memorable during his years at columbia it isnt true that no one ever came forward from obamas past saying they knew him attended school with him was his friend etc those who have attested to having daily personal experience with him during his time at that school include friend and roommate sohale siddiqi whom the associated press located and interviewed in may roommate phil boerner who provided his recollections of sharing a new york city apartment with classmate barack obama to the columbia college today alumni publication and the new york times in early michael l baron who taught the yearlong honors seminar in american foreign policy that barack obama took during his senior year at columbia and recalled in an nbc interview obamas easily acing the class and receiving an a for his senior paper on the topic of nuclear negotiations with the soviet unionlikewise other external evidence documents barack obamas presence at columbia from  including an article by barack obama published in the  march  edition of columbias sundial school magazinea january  columbia college today profile of barack obama as a columbia alumnusa columbia college press release from november  identifying him as the first college alumnus to be elected president of the united states no one or one professor theres a fair amount of difference between one person who claims to remember every student thats gone through and every person as columbia he should release his reddit username yep  its the no true obama fallacy its because the left hammered bush on his grades cs he needs to release his diaper imprints  every president in the modern era has released their college transcripts its particularly troublesome since over  alumni of obamas supposed class at columbia never had obama in any of their classes nor ever saw him at columbia its pretty interesting i have a feeling his grades are poorer than his intelligent reputation should allow for well a number of his fellow students basically he was a screwup in college and got bad grades  judging from his opinions and interpretations of constitutional law and his obvious misunderstanding of it id say this is beyond just plausible or likely cop out  yeah next theyll say well obama didnt release the tags on his underwear we deserve to know if its fruit of the loom or hanes maybe obama should release the kraken on romney i have the answer to that question tldr they want his college transcripts because they believe he attended college under a different name using an international foreign exchange program as a student from indonesia  which would explain the lack of record of student loans and also potentially produce a foreign birth certificateit doesnt sound as crazy when you give it this much context but im still not sure im on board theyre just coming off as big babies theres a book about this if you give a mouse a cookie essentially i always ask people that bring the transcripts up if theres an think that could be in them that would change how they were going to vote havent gotten a single yes yet the guy has been president for four years there isnt anything  year old transcripts will tell you that his actual presidency wouldnt gt i dont get the college transcripts anywaybased on obamas history expect to see his college transcripts released bundled with a throw down to romney to release his tax returns they probably just want to find something radical in them you know like a womens studies course  then they can point and scream he thinks women are equal to men  burn him because in college he might of had a b what does that say to america  muslim terrorist of course especially since dudes been potus for  years at this pointboth people who love obama and semireasonable people who hate obamas guts can agree that thats the best predictor of what kind of president hed make  c in comparative literature  not anywhere in the running compared to that what was his gpa in both degrees pretty much romneys reason if he gives in on tax returns what else is there he is already precieved as weak lol we havent seen obamas automotive maintenance records  maybe he failed an emissions inspectionyou know what that meanscommunism  if hes got nothing to hide why doesnt he release these one of the main reasons it is speculated he wont release his college transcripts is the fact that it is very possible he applied the the institutions as a foreigner  that must be it you fucking idiot yeah but has any politician released their college transcripts  my search can only find that kerry released his and bush and gores transcripts were not released but acquired by journalistic sources  the whole thing is like johnhummel says its just more moving goal posts  the tea partiers could have uninterrupted footage of every second of his life and theyd still have  conspiracy theories about him why are republican conspiracy theories so lame  they dont even seem relevant to anything meaningful  who even has their college transcripts or remembers their grades at obamas age uhh pretty sure if you had uninterrupted footage of every second of any presidents life youd end up with a pretty negative opinion of them  i mean obama signed the ndaa for christs sake hes kept gitmo open and he has executed american citizens without trial or habeus corpus  hes not a good guy  hes a politician which means his ideals are tempered by reality  theres no way to close guantanamo in a poltically feasible fashion  he tried and was faced with such hostility that he had to decide if it was better to expend political capital on that or other programs  he serves at the beck and call of goldman bankers because if he didnt romney would be flooded with so much cash the election wouldnt even stand a chanceterms like good guy and bad guy are too simplistic  getting a slightlyleft of the american center president in office gives the liberalprogressive wing of the democratic party more power  if you want more progressive policies your best option is to support obama at the presidential level and work for more change at your congressional level well stated the problem i see with obama haters from the left is that they see the world in a very idealistic way a very black amp white way   a way that really has very little to do with the way the world really is theres a path forward but its not idealism  its pragmatism powered by idealism this is the way its always been in politics idealism is great in art but its not realistic in politics he didnt keep gitmo open congress wouldnt let him close it most of the negative stuff people think about obama is because they dont understand how our political system works and they give the presidency more power in their imaginations than it has in reality not decisions i agreed with but i dont think you can call him a good or bad guy  the office requires a lot of decisions that are catch s  at very least hes a better option than the alternative hes not a better option than gary johnson  rd party candidates will continue to be ignored unless people stop acting like theyre throwing away their votes and realize that enough votes for a fringe candidate will make them be taken seriously  totally read that in obamas voice well done if you want to enhance that effect replace some of those instances of people with folks obama might be safer saying perhaps as a response to a question at a press conference that his opponent is well within his legal rights to withhold information about his past that he doesnt wish to share with the american publicpolitics am fun the college transcripts thing is so ludicrous how is that at all relevant  yeah but obama graduated magna cum laude from law school and was the president of the harvard law review i can already infer he got at least a  at law school and his gpa was obviously phenomenal in undergrad to gain entrance into harvard law school  im always confused about how people wonder what his gpa was when you see those credentials its pretty obvious he kicked ass in school if i were obama i wouldnt release my transcripts either that is a road map to everyone who ever taught him in college and would subject them to the republican lie machine would be nice if we could point out mitts purchase of the mass governors office computers to bury all the evidence on those machines as well well said  but as the completely out of context you didnt build that spam shows its the quick oneliners that really grab attention not wellthoughtout rational arguments alexanderwales  i read that in obamass voice  the sealed college transcripts is a myth i didnt say that they were sealed just that they werent released actually its news to me that people are claiming he had them sealed  thats just dumb as is asking for his college transcripts in the first place who cares about college transcripts i partied way too much and barely graduated isnt the point of college to enjoy it this is relevant upvoted for having a conversation with yourself im voting for alexanderwales  i read that in his voice choom gang brah obama is going to lose this election why do you say that right now the general consensus that ive seen is that hes between a  and  favorite the market should collapse after labor day thats how obama got elected in the first place the market collapse of  when it happens in  forget about any consensus you are seeing right now and just pray that obama does not see the wrong end of a sniper rifle because there are going to be some pissed off people college records could say a lot mine for instance if sealed would conceal the information that ive attended  different universities in  different countries thats just for starters hes hiding something maybe hes just embarassed by his grades but hes still hiding them   proof of the birth certificate not that i dont believe you it just gets annoying every time i hear people talking about him not having a proper one  they didnt even flatten his birth certificate when they made it in photoshop give me a break the birth certificate obama released was a forgery  seriously ampamp the investigations technical analysis relied on the work of mara zebest an author and tech editor who was enlisted by the cold case posse to look at the documents she concluded in a report that obamas pdf file can no longer be referred to as a document since that term implies it existed and started in paper form obamas pdf must be referred to as a digital file because that is all it has ever been ms zebest says mr obamas longform birth certificate is not even a good forgery poor is an understatement its horrific she said when it was released i still expected a file that would be difficult to determine as fraudulent but when i opened it up within seconds it was clear it was an obvious fake  in order to make sure she wasnt seeing things she says she called a friend who was also familiar with computer programming he downloaded it from the white house website and had the same reaction oh my god somebody has been very sloppy here he said according to ms zebestread more if you honestly honestly believe there was a forgery i dont know what to tell you this articleaddressed some of the technical issues raised by zebest personally i dont understand what else would be needed to prove where he was born he has provided his original birth certificate the health department in hawaii confirmed it he provided his long form certificate and birth announcements in the local paper corroborate it why do we have a law about that anyway its not very important to me where a person was born you can fuss about whether he is a good leader honest strong smart whatever born on the dirt of this land or on the dirt of another land not so much people said they wanted to see my birth certificate so i released my birth certificate a cheap hack photoshop of a bullshit birth certificate ftfy no it wouldnt because he balked for the longest time before producing the birth certificate and then balked another long time before he produced the longform versionnot saying they arent real or whatever just that its not like he immediately produced those things when people bitched about them so itd look like a case of potkettle as romney is balking with his tax returns the longest time factcheck had a picture of the birth cert up months before the election  it wasnt like obama released a falsified birth certificate from a corrupt state or anything no of course not im not worried about obama releasing his paperwork nearly as much as i am him upholding his campaign promises  which he hasnt  of course romney will be the exact same but how anyone can see the difference between george dubya and barack obama is beyond me theyre like mirror images of each other   not when it comes to public speaking every time bush opened his mouth i was embarrassed to be an american the dixie chicks were right good thing the decisions werent made by bush but by the same global elite bankers and multinational corporate shareholders as are currently making obamas decisions and will make romneys should he get elected oh wait thats actually a terrible thing nevermind  this is why i fall over laughing whenever someone calls obama a socialist look im as disappointed as the next guy that obama has continued the expansion of the powers of the executive branch as the next guy but theres that huge neoconservative foreign policy element of the bush presidency that obama has distanced himself from obamas militaristic but not with the same nationbuilding imperialistic slant and while obama and democrats in general have let wall street off the hook he doesnt subscribe to reagans voodoo economics as bush did its a cute point to talk about how all politicians break their promises and how obama didnt end all of bushs policies  but its disingenuous at best and ignorant at worst to say that bush and obama are mirror images of each other  the differences between them are just in rhetoric and semantics  you dont like obamas foreign policy but its okay because he doesnt have a nation building imperialistic slant  i would disagree and say that the pending invasion of iran just wait would prove my pointyou say that obama let the wall street bankers off the hook but its okay because he doesnt subscribe to reagans voodoo economics honestly whats the difference  reagan bush and obama have all been working to eliminate the middle class who cares what they say from the podium if the laws they pass are essentially the same bush bailed out the bankersobama bailed out the bankersbush pushed jobs overseasobama pushed jobs overseasbush pushed nation building preemptive imperialistic warsobama pushed nation building preemptive imperialistic warsbush signed the patriot actobama signed the ndaathe way i see it its disingenuous at best and ignorant at worst to say that bush and obama are anything but mirror images of each other  pending invasion of iran obama has proven himself more inclined to use diplomacy over force and has chosen not kowtow to israel on the issue of irantarp passed under bush and bailed out the bankersarra the  stimulus passed under obama and tried to use government spending to prop up the economylets be clear  obama has chosen not to prosecute or hold wall street accountable for its role in the  crash and did pass a large unfunded stimulus which affected our deficit he did not however bail out the bankers he did bail out the auto industryim not going to particularly blame either president for pushing jobs overseas  companies have been doing this for the last  years but the role of the president has more been a failure to prevent than active participationtwo wars started under bush one of which iraq was perpetrated under fraudulent pretenses and largely without international support after the world knew there were no wmds in iraq the justification for our war there became to spread democracyobama oversaw our withdrawal from iraq an increase in drone strikes in afghanistan and pakistan and an internationally supported military intervention in libya with no troops on the ground mind you preemptive would be if we invaded syria  and this administration has already made clear its intentions to exhaust all diplomatic options and sanctions before considering any sort of intervention in syriayes obama signed the ndaa  affirming the powers already granted the executive office under the authorization for use of military force resolution from  dont get me wrong the provisions concern me greatly but the ndaa is not treading new ground but is rather a continuation of the set of laws passed under president bush around  including but not limited to the patriot act where obama bears responsibility is in not pushing back against the expansion of executive privilege which exploded in the bush years its often been said that the power of government is like a ratchet once it clicks forward a notch its nearly impossible to move it back this doesnt let obama off the hook for his role as a president who tacitly expressed his approval for these powers by not fighting them but as someone often accused of being soft on national security it comes as no surprise that he didnti have a number of reasons for being frustrated with president obama but lets base our arguments off of facts  that would be pretty hilarious i can see obama doing this it would be a bad move because obama would then be equating the tax returns which romney wants to hide to his own birth certificate which he has no reason to hide and the birthers movement is precisely saying that obama is trying to hide his birth certificate which is untrue i kind of feel like thats what romney wants obama to say obama conflating birtherism with reasonable requests to see romneys tax returns would be a big mistake he played this one right all romney would do with that is go back to his pathetic victim role criticizing obama for running a campaign of anger and asking for the divisive rhetoric to stopmitt is so full of shit its not even funny my only concern is that there are people stupid enough to buy into it all funny before i saw this piece thispopped up in my facebook feed it all makes sense now the dsccis your reddit friend amirite because weve already seen them  maybe mitt is using the same tactic that obama used with the birth issue maybe he has actually nothing to hide and is waiting for the obama campaign to cry for him to release it then he releases it and makes them look like fools not saying mitt has nothing to hide but if its the case he is playing his card right it was a joke liberals get there panties in a wad so easily  when i read the first sentence this was the rebuttal i was expecting before i read obamas reply i was already thinking really romney youre setting him up for something so easy  or i sent romney a copy ask him for it says he keeps it stapled to his tax returns maybe when he says the two of us he means him and obama   that would work except that obama is the one asking for the returns he is starting a controversy and feeding it too slam dunk moon walk i can see romney keeping this as an ace in the hole  as this tax return thing gains speed he is going to let it stew  then one fine day just before the election he is going to use it as a trump card  i wonder what the obama campaign will do to respond the media is playing everyone for a fool these options are no different than kfc taco bell and pizza hut  i guess that means ron paul is wendys saying its way better than fast food when its still just fast foodand gary johnson is the food truck that offers delicious handmade meals that may or may not give you dysentery the only thing more annoying than hyperbolic partisanship are the wake up sheeple style criticisms of said partisanship  substitute chipotle eh everybody said that about bush v gore because bush was so moderate during the campaign and it turned out bush was a closet neocon extremist who wanted to wage wars of conquest said the kenyan they place we born raised sounds i i born us black guy doesnt yup  its dog whistle politics  say something that seems innocuous on the surface but lets racists know you really think like them agreed he can come out on the record and say he believes  that obama was born in america but at the same time say that people dont wonder if he himself was born here because of his appearancethat fact that obama looks foreign is at the heart of all this birther shit when i ask rational people if they really believe such an elaborate conspiracy has taken place to get obama into the oval office they say of course not just that he doesnt act american etc etc  what is that from well either the pilot is severely jaundiced or its the simpsons oh wow how did i not notice thatderp you probably just overlooked it dont beat yourself up over it i always wondered if not being us born would actually bother people besides for the fact that it goes against our constitution if they still had to go under strict criteria i myself wouldnt care but thats just me the coach of the us womens soccer team isnt american and ya know what gold metal thread yes     gold is a metal sonuva au crap au shucks  the coach didnt get a gold medal gtthe coach of the us womens soccer team isnt american and ya know what gold metal threadactually he moved to iowa in  and became a us citizen in  so hes an american nowhes been living the us for longer than a lot of american redditors have been alive gabby douglas is not a soccer team dont thread yourself  if its thread worthy someone else will do it thats the joke its not  oh actually now that i look at it again i see how painfully obvious that is  shame on me for falling for it the first time  very well carry on nah its all about simply having your side win if schwarzenegger wanted the potus the gop would use obama as precedent that the foreignborn rule should be overturned grover norquist himself said sothey dont care who their leaders are so long as they vote the party line everything else is window dressing yeah i remember the conservative push to get schwarzenegger lined up for presidenti kept thinking i cant wait for them to freak out when they figure out a mexican could then be voted in as president to be fair i wouldve voted for ricardo montalban       you can either trade fairly for our soft corinthianleather goods or i will do far worse than kill you ambassador ill hurt you and i wish to go on hurting you i shall leave you as you left me as you left these cordobas marooned for all eternity in the center of a dead planet buried alive buried alive       just picture it only if herv villechaize couldve been vice president it shouldnt bother people and it was only really put in the constitution to prevent the british or another european power from swooping in and taking over the fledgling republic politically nowadays a decently long residency and citizenship requirement  years should be enough gt nowadays a decently long residency and citizenship requirement  years should be enoughdepends on how long of a view you take they were citizens who were recruited by the kgb and your example does more to show that birth citizenship is relatively unimportant there have been some serious discussions about changing the birth requirement so that people like madeleine albright and arnold schwarzenegger could run  id be pretty happy with reasonably long residency and citizenship requirements i think the chances of someone plotting for  years to become president while secretly being an agent of a foreign power are pretty tolerably small now that i would mind theres a lot of debate what constitutes a natural born citizen if you look at the us code it details the different requirements and the minimum is having one american parents so in my opinion barry couldve been born on the moon and still been eligible to be president mccain was born outside the us he was a natural born citizen because other than obviously being born in honolulu his mother was a us citizen when he was born  if he was born on mars hed still be eligible for president this guy dont look foreign you dont want to read mormon doctrine on native americans then he seems to have had one of the most unusualmysterious childhoods of recent presidentspeople he has coffee mugs playing on the birthed joke wheres your sense of humor president obama might have a funny name but he doesnt look foreign  he looks like a black guy i can hear this loud and clear  dog whistles are supposed to be a bit more selective  its an outright racist jab dogs are racist shit now im depressed agreed ronald reagan holding his first postconvention speech in philadelphia mississippi the site of one of the most notorious murder cases of the civil rights era talking about restoring states rights is dog whistle politics romney doesnt have nearly reagans grace or his campaign staff for that matter  actually im not so sure look at the top comments on here reddit is very liberal but still more people are taking the tax return irony angle rather than the hey this is incredibly racist angle i guess that must be what hes banking on does it benefit him if people look at it as tax return irony because it neutralizes the tax return issue by making it seem as petty as the birther issue absolutely fortunately obama appears not to have fallen into that trap himself and instead subtly called romney out on his racism the beauty of these things is that when an opponent points out that the statement was thinlyveiled racism you can call the opponent the racist makes one sick its a strange variation of dog whistle politics  everyone can hear it but the only ones who wont admit they can are the dogs lets be serious romney isnt actually a racist hes just a massive gaffe machine everything he says is a screwup or contradicts something he said earlier he can turn a question as simple as what was the last book you read into an awkward situation and a media shitstorm  itd be hilarious to see a politician just pick a book in the top  of the current ny times best seller list of which the top  are  shades of grey and i think  used to be the trilogy as a whole there may be bigger racists out there but he at least thinks birtherism is cute enough to joke about  the gaffe factor comes into play because  these things that are brewing under his stonefaced surface boil up   romney is not racist hes just terrible at pr and humor obama and romney will trash each others policies until election day but you wont see them attacking their opponents as people  given that hes a devout follower of a religion that until  held that black people were born inferior to those with white skin flatout saying romney is not racist is probably a bit generous think like them or are at least appealing to them lets never assume we have the faintest idea what is really going on inside a politicians psyche they probably dont even know what they believe if were talking about romney its whatever he was programmed to believe  my theory is he got a firmware upgrade that was designed more for energizing the base than appealing to independents and this gaffe was an unfortunate side effect it also lets the nonracists know how you really thinkamphellip reminds me of biden making the put yall back in chains comment  innocuous on the surface but lets you know he thinks romney is racist  im a huge fan of the term dog whistle politics i plan on using it more often whats amazing is romneys father was born in mexico and tried to run for president  his father actually lied amp said he was born in the us then after it was proven he wasnt he had to quit campaigning even though technically he could run because though he was born in mexico amp his parents lived in mexico his parents were born in the us weird huh this always sends me down a rabbit hole are they really racist remarks or are we the racists for attributing a racist undertone to them ie welfarequeens and yet the only people who appear to hear the dog whistle are you guyshmmmmmmm either you guys are a bunch of racists or you dont want to miss out on the next round of beggin strips i know i wouldnt want to miss out on that im white like you whites are people too my friend raises hand not me  well to tell the family secret my grandmother was dutch  mitt knows because he can see that the trees are the right height he likes cars nuff said you sure didnt he say his wife only drove a couple of cadillacs should be a lot if he really likes cars and maybe you know something other than a big boring expensive cadillac  will the real mitt romney please stand up that was fucking great not all caddilacs are boring cars ctsv in wagon form ats etcalthough most of them are all true i just dont see mitt as a ctsv kind of guy opinions are like yachts everybody has them  mitt romney some of his best friends own companies that own companies that make them i like trains roboromney approves of the adequate height of the flora when he sees sequoias does he get a buffer overflow error right thats the fucked up part of this not the birther thing its like laughing at minorities hey im white and pure not like the brown mutt no one is sure of his origins haha gawkereveryone knows im a real american due to my white skin no one would ever ask to see my papers because i am white yea yea racism rcirclejerk the gop goes into a fauxrage when people cry racism but all i know as a dem living in tx is that my patriotism and love of america was questioned for  years when i didnt support bush but the moment a black man was elected as president the majority of texan republicans hated the united states of america so much they supported secessionbut im sure it has nothing to do with race well to be fair it could be because hes a democrat and not as crazy as them and given that restaurant patrons there ask not to be served by democrat waitresses who always happen to be of color your statement works either way yup  they think theyre so being so clever with their shrouded racism hype up the wedge issues its the karl rove strategy keeps people looking at one thing while the power brokers destroy america behind our backs hype the wedge issues was the nixon strategy the rove strategy is attack his strengths swiftboat etc how does that sound like that at all  nobodys ever asked to see his birth certificate because they know that this is the place where both of us were born how do they know because he looks like the white majority of the us population because he doesnt have a foreignsounding name they know because michigan is the state where romney was born and raised and thats where he told the joke today in commerce michigan how does they know that this is the place that we were born and raised imply that one of them wasnt born and raised here im not a romney supporter but your comment is a really unfair characterization lol  yeah that was obviously a racist commentyou people are fucking nuts upvoting shit like this  its hilarious thats exactly what it sounds like everything mitt romney does is racistupvotes please yeah its not like  of the us population is black or anything  obviously what you need to realize is this birther thing has been going on for years and has obvious racial connotations mitt has to be very familiar with it with that in mind what message does saying they know we were born and raise here send how do they know thatmaybe it was just another off the cuff gaff its tough to tell anymore and while romney says he was just making a joke its pretty damning that the audience wasnt laughing they were cheering that was exactly how it sounded to me too goes right along with the aglo heritage comment im not the target of racist claims from people that when shown evidence ignore it but my opponent is clearly that means i am the better choice that is basically what he is saying right right because the general public doesnt know black people are born in the usa get real  thats ridiculous because there arent any black people born in the us  it was a joke and is being totally overanalyzed by a nervous media and campaignoops sorry for the redundancy  its because hes a namp thats funny to me because mitt looks to me like someone born and raised in the netherlands why insult the netherlands i was born here to keep my money over there hes test driving the birther movement taking its temperature  rallying the crazies   since when have black people been born in the us stop making it about race please many people flocked to the birther movement to explain to themselves why obama seemed so un american it was easier for them to think he wasnt an american than to admit to themselves that a majority of americans are now  agreeing with non traditional values yeah because barrack hussein obama is a muslim and we need to figure out where this jerkface was born and how this disgraceful man got into office  thats in fact precisely what hes implying sure its sick but whats sicker is how the crowd cheers him on when he says shit like that thats exactly what i thought the stupidest romney did release birth certificateawkward courting donald trumpand you who asked birth certificate romneys fatherwho president despite born mexico luckily hes white if only there was some way to nullify this maybe we should make our politicians wear some sort of garment that covers them from head to toe  you know so we dont get too excited about what they look like  because we cant control ourselves well id bet he does have a large bodycovering white robe somewhere around but i dont think he likes to wear it publicly he could just take off his over clothes and wear his magic underwear im no fan of romney but is it really fair to even joke about him being a white supremacist hes never made any allusions to race in his entire campaign despite the fact that most of his political base is comprised of rednecks its the pointy hood that does it gtmaybe we should make our politicians wear some sort of garment that covers them from head to toe a burquaim down with that thank you ted just when i thought you were going to make a joke about magical mormon underwear yeah nobodys worried about white mexicans just the brown ones american citizens can be born in mexico or panama like john mccain no he didnt release his birth certificate he released a certificate of live birth from the state of michigan which as everybody knows is not the same thing  where is his official long form birth certificate  why wont he just release it and make all these awkward questions go away did he rape and murder a girl in   im just asking questions hes like a reverse anchor baby not a reverse anchor baby per se just a white anchor baby my favorite thing ever is that romney is actually an anchor baby thats pretty ridiculous  i know you guys are trying to be flippant but at least be factual  citizenship isnt something limited to those born on us soil   he retroactively took it back i saw those they are fakeit isnt his real birth certificate and it looked photoshopped what you can run for president of the usa without being born there i thought it was a requirement gtthe stupidest part is that romney actually did release his own birth certificate as part of his awkward courting of donald trumpyou know whats even dumber the age of romneys mother on his birth certificate is wrong she was  when he was born but the birth certificate says of course not a single word from birthers about that error its ok because hes white if obama had that error they would be screaming about it nonstop guaranteed gton thursday night romney mentioned the fact that his father was born in mexico in response to gingrichs allegations that he is antiimmigrant which raises the question migration  immigration if his father was already an american citizen how is it an example of immigration he well goddamn i love white its good to own land i cant wait to own some land then i can finally vote not if antipater and phocion fuck it all up againoh wrong millennium my bad and people well corporations are people my friend but those people aint your friend its good to be the king i had to find it louis ck if it were an option id reup every year uh yes i will take white again please thanks he wouldnt have said it better than louis ck cause he wouldnt be doing a bit i wish obama would say that just once since hes half white just to fuck with the american public that deserves to be slapped in their face for tolerating and encouraging such a bullshit narrative outside of detroit and certain suburbs this state is really white so he can probably get away with it mittens wouldnt ever go to the minority parts with their dirty poori feel like mi already has its super embarrassing politician though kwame kilpatrick former thug mayor of detroit so mittens really needs to step down and stop trying to claim us both rational voters extremely concerned look its simple there undecideds election i youre undecided point youre paying attention youre idiot this campaign shifted its strategy its rallying base people vote  its longer attempt convince undecideds independents its reason picked paul ryan its reason voter id laws hot now this country too polarized too people switch sides its candidate people vote the fact romneys strategy vote rallying base telling lies welfare work requirement taking obamas comments infrastructure context lying medicare savings obamas bill labeling them stealing appealing birthers you retarded republican base is edit fair who want vote third party i agree there people disillusioned with parties therefore undecided im referring broader electorate who will voting republican democrat cue facile both parties suck comments lately i find this attitude more willfully ignorant and contemptible than any gop dogma at least with the gop they know theyre stupid and arent dealing in facts  they just dont care the both parties suck people on the other hand think theyre being clever and above it and doing any good for anyone at all fuck them it makes me sick to read that on reddit i think people voting for third parties are fine they vote on ideology that they want the ones that dont vote or believe republicans and democrats are the same are truly so ignorant that they believe they are  correct remember if you cant find a flaw or weaknessin your paradigm you probably think too highly of yourself and need to humble the fuck out people say both parties suck when they mean i have to make some compromises no matter which party i choose but one of the parties would throw salt in my eye and the other would stab me  times and legitimately rape me and leave me for deadno ones ushering in federal laws to make it clear its always legal to record the policeno one is closing guantanamo no one is legalizing marijuanano one is passing a budgetbut theres plenty of differences they both suck but theres a sucking continuum   thank you for reminding me of the word facile that is indeed the perfect description of the both parties suck cliche finally some mother fucker says what this mother fucker has wanted some mother fucker to say all mother fucking long gtat least with the gop they know theyre stupid and arent dealing in facts  they just dont carea quick look through rpolitics on any given day will show the same thing about democrats its actually funny ive heard people with phds in poly sci consistently argue that both parties are terrible i dont know maybe both parties do actually suck maybe the fact that were at least acknowledging the problem is better than willfully accepting it and trying to work around it what about those who vote for third parties or candidates that dont follow the party lines i dont know if the gop understands their own platformsunless theyre really good actors and actresses they seem like the truly believe what they espouse  both parties do suck right now  neither is focusing on shit that actually matters in terms of getting this country back on its feet  the right is pandering archaic social issues and the left is focusing on not being the right  what each party really needs is someone to step up and stop bullshitting us all and give a laid out plan to get shit fixed which includes the topics that are political suicide raising taxes or replacing our tax code with something more inclusive and less complicated delete spending including military etc the scary part is the both parties suck line is just another word for false equivalencies and is actually part of the political strategy of the right whenever caught doing something unethical  not every republican politicians engages in it but its sad that the reps have sunk to a point that their best chance of winning is convincing you the other side is as bad as they are rather than talk about being better wow look how above everything you are  can i jerk you off please aw look at you thinking presidential elections matter like choosing between a child abuser and a rapist you mean i completely disagree both parties are garbage  one is just worse than the other why wouldnt there be undecideds any evidence of this sorry for third party rocking it took awhile but it looks i finally found someone who understands less about politics than i do  gtyoure either not paying attention or youre an idiotthe fact that i disagree with the rest of your biased exaggerated opinions does not make me an idiot rather your onesided rage about retarded republicans clearly shows you have not taken a good look at your own party you are supporting  well it is about bedfellows  do i want  i might vote for romney if he releases his returns  he was a moderate governor in practice   what he is running off is entirely different  i think he is just pandering and will govern in the middle like everyone else  if he is a tax cheat no vote   i agree that no one could be undecided at this point but think the real fight is now in keeping the gop from illegally blocking voters and stealing votes  i think i fall under the category of not paying attention other than the little bit of information i see here and there on reddit i dont watch the news or keep up with politics i dont want to go indepth but from all that ive read i just plain dislike romney and dont want to vote for him some of what ive read of obama makes him out to be far worse than romney my friend whos influenced by his republican nutjob i cant think of a better term father tricked me into seeing  obamas america despite thinking a lot of the documentary was bullshit and lacking any hard information or facts it did change my view about obama  after watching the movie i got to see his dads view on politics and watched some clips and videos despite my distaste for how blind they are to romney and how strong they feel about obama and democrats it was still an eye opening experience how fast the debt is growing and some of obamas plans for his second term are quite scary  if what i saw and read is true america is heading down a dark pathcould romney really be any worsemy friend often likes to not listen to others views and talk over them when in an argument and now i know where he gets it fromhis fathersomething else that bothers me is how often obama is taken out of context to make him look bad when there are perfectly good examples of obama making himself out to be a bad guy going unused at least here on reddit i am merely undecided on which third party person deserves my vote vote naderagain again  would be first for me  rocky andersonedit  not really if you are yearning for a repetition of  sure  im looking to undo every political decision since   is that possible i have done it only once also bring weapons sadly only unkempt fingernails and strong will here go ahead throw your vote awaydont blame me im voting for kodos kang  huh throw you are vote away whats that mean fixed same boat here  i really like stein and mostly dislike johnson but since johnson has a much larger movement and neither have a chance to win im considering voting johnson just to have a decent turnout for a single third party i have not yet decided either  gary performed well in new mexico and was reelected for a second term despite being a republican in a democratic state  he has at least been a twoterm governori love jill stein and everything she stands for  but i dont think she has held political office before  president is a pretty big jump from zero  im skeptical of her facing off with putinif i decide to vote principle ill vote jill   exactly  while i agree with jill in principle i also realize that her getting  instead wont make any difference whereas johnson getting several points total is a small step towards changing our broken twoparty system kony  herb tarlek  if romneys birth certificate stapled tax records wed never it my reddit comment of the day award goes to you  hes birther hes smug shit hes not anything  hes whatever he needs to be that day in order to further himself   period not a birther but would love to get some birther votes he may be an afterbirther  his mother made an error tossed the newborn and raised the placenta  ba ha ha no one liked my obgyn grandfathers joke ever notice people who concerned obamas birth certificate arent bit concerned mitts tax returns whats racist about tax returns from a rich white dudenothing special here you mean the kkk members disguised as rural midwesterners ever notice that the people who are the most concerned about mitts tax returns werent the least bit concerned about obamas birth certificate because he released it are you obtuse obviously there was a period of time between the point where a bunch of partisan hacks were making up conspiracy theories and the point where he released the long form certificate i hope you can see the parallels now  zzzzz i dont believe obama was born in usa and i believe its completely obvious mitt is hiding something disgusting what makes you believe that obama wasnt born in the us are you a unicorn im more concerned with what obamas done with my money than i am with what mitts done with his money since mitt hasnt paid his fair percentage then mitts money is your money  what does that have to do with his birth certificate obama manages your money sweet he paid over  million dollars in income taxes in   million returns in  paid  taxes im more concerned about the  million me too its a scandal that so many people make so little money they dont qualify to pay the minimum income taxhe paid more because he owed it hes not special concerned troll is concerned how does this have so many downvotes  rpolitics is fucking pathetic lmao  his point is very valid  the majority of people asking for his tax returns dont pay shit for taxes   gt the majority of people asking for his tax returns dont pay shit for taxesmajority of people who think this way are idiots truth hurts eh lefty   what truth the assumptions you make about people the baseless idea that the people asking for tax returns also pay no taxes the stupid comparison of someone who earns millions and millions paying less of a  of his income than people who dont earn enough to pay anythingtroll harder calling people who you dont disagree with trolls just means you have zero basis for argument   you already lost the game libtard  ill take a cheeseburger with fries   gt calling people who you dont disagree with trolls just means you have zero basis for argumentwait do i not disagree with you or dont i not agree with you im confused calling someone you dont agree with a lefty and libtard means you have zero basis for argument i assume as well rightyou still havent explained your truth as you call it absolutely right  poor people shouldnt have a say  we should only listen to those who have status  thats always worked out oh so wells gtthe majority of people asking for his tax returns dont pay shit for taxeseveryone with a job pays payroll taxes everyone with property pays property taxes then theres state amp municipal taxes sales taxes excise taxes on goods like gasoline amp alcohol etc obamas mother american citizen its irrelevant where born if your biological parents american you american citizenship matter where you born a fact birthers conveniently ignore not strictly trueedit for example if obamas mother had lived outside the us long enough without spending at least  years total inside the us including  since her th birthday he would not be a citizen of course she lived in the us much longer and he was actually born in hawaii thats just an example  actually the law on birthright citizenship was a bit tighter in  than it is today requiring all  years to come after the th birthday  obamas mom was  at the time of his birth and so missed this qualification by a few months can you provide a source for thisnevermind i found it so does this mean that obama actually isnt a naturalborn citizen  reddit wont be happy  edit im discussing the idea that he was not born in the us because it sounded like the posts above were trying to argue that such a qualm would be a moot point it looks like if he were not born in the us he would not have citizenship thats all im trying to clarify however im finding it frustratingly difficult to find what the actual law was before  its alluded to but im not finding any text  edit finally found text for the immigration and nationality act of  if he were born outside of the us he would not be considered a citizen because his mother had not lived  years in the us past the age of  she was  when he was born   he is a natural born citizen because he was born here  if he was not born here he would not be a natural born citizen but theres compelling evidence that he was born in the usa wtf are you talking about are you claiming he was not born in the usa  wasnt this bs settled years ago when obama was born an earlier version of that law was in effect search  if it doesnt link to the right post which would probably be the appropriate rule it stated that the parent needed to be a resident of the us for  years at least  after  years of age since his mother was  thats not possible if he didnt meet the birthplace requirement he wouldnt be eligible as he doesnt meet the requirement at the time through his mother heressome text of the  act that says this   i like you you use facts and examples chemistry degree occasionally delivers george romney was born in mexico but was eligible to become us president i think you mean one of many facts birthers ignore like the fact he has a passport  like the fact that no other federal agency has mentioned any discrepancy it is only a bunch of noname hillbillies making the claim and donald trump the famous nammed hillbilly and sheriff joe arpaio hes a private citizen who holds no political office you should be naming the politicians making this claim if you want to make a point and the most prominent senators and congressmenwomen in the gop and fox news and talk radio and so the people who pander to noname hillbilles exactly noname hillbillies i wish that was the case as it stands currently you have to kiss trumps ring to run for the republicans nom  no federal agency other than the courts decide naturalborn citizenship you dont think that is part of a comprehensive background check citizenship yes  naturalborn citizenship no since thats never been definitively defined and only matters for presidentvicepresident the problem is that it isnt a bunch if nobodies making the claim i was gonna say they have to be born on american soil but then i actually went and read article ii of the constitution and youuuu may be on to something there not to mention john mccain good thing the senate passed a resolution declaring that mccain is a naturalborn citizen  which btw brock cosponsored indeed in fact of the resolutions sponsors there were five democrats including hillary clinton who was still running for president at the time and one republican why the fuck did they do that his father was a serving officer in the navy at the time washington post february  gtsen barack obamas campaign announced he would cosponsor legislation introduced yesterday by his political ally sen claire mccaskill dmo to ensure that john mccain can become president even though he was born in the panama canal zonegtthe issue of mccains eligibility was raised in a new york times articlenoting the constitutional requirement that a us president be a naturalborn citizen had never been fully definedgtthe mccaskill bill submitted immediately after she scrawled it onto a notepad on the senate floor in response to the times story would establish the eligibility of anyone born to a us citizen who is serving overseas as an active or reserve member of the us armed forces the arizona senators father was a navy officer serving in the canal zone when mccain was born there in gtsenator mccain has earned the right to be his partys nominee and no loophole should prevent him from competing in this campaign obama said after this weeks events ive learned that republicans should do the exact opposite of whatever claire mccaskill says they should do and i believe us military bases regardless of which country theyre in are considered us soil  i dont think so when i was stationed in yokosuka the kanagawa prefectural police investigated traffic accident on base even minor ones involving only gaijin  they have to be natural born not be born on american soilthere are two types of citizens natural born and naturalized   anyone born a citizen is natural born  dont let the whole jus sanguinis and jus soli thing confuse you its a moot point brought up by those birthers who want to sound more enlightened    you are confused  the issue is naturalborn citizenship a clause that has never been fully defined by scotus  not citizenship the requirements for presidency are stricter than the requirements for citizenship  a fact that derp derp derp  im not a birther by any stretch but if youre going to argue with them at least know wtf you are talking about i just learned that the other day and i still dont understand why that was never mentioned once by obama or the media over the last four years because the issue is naturalborn citizenship not citizenship does that matter when becoming president yes i read the case the court judgement they are citing upholds denying suffrage to women too that indeed tells you about the type of person who cares about this  not sure what youre referring to but yes the constitution allowed for denying suffrage to women until we passed an amendment saying otherwise the constitution does not in words say who shall be naturalborn citizens there are two common laws brought up one accepted one with doubts for the purposes of this case it is not necessary to solve these doubts actually the constitution defines natural born citizen as opposed to a naturalized citizennot that its an issue for me but you must be born in the states to run for potus or have an explicit allowance granted by congress theres actually no such requirement per se the clause youre thinking of is that you must be a natural born citizen which is very inconveniently never defined so it would presumably be tested in courts if it were ever an issue one would rationally conclude i hope that a natural born citizen is a citizen born a citizen as opposed to one who gains citizen later in life called confusingly naturalization obamas mother being an american citizen and living in the us for a period of time before obamas birth would mean that even if obama was born abroad hed still be a citizen at birth anywayand yeah congress has the power to retroactively assignconfirm natural born status to anyone as they did to john mccain not that that bill was challenged in courts but its not like anyones going to sacrifice their political career by claiming an upstanding and decorated former pow with a rich naval family history is unamerican well the constitution specifically requires that the president be a natural born citizenand that term has never been very clearly defined  the most common opinion seems to be that individuals born abroad to us parents still count as natural born citizens but the supreme court has never ruled on the matterof course the birthers are ridiculous and this in no way justifies their concerns  funny how they never had a problem with the fact that mccain was born in panama i was born outside the country and but both my parents are american and i have american citizenship as well i have always been told i could not run for president if i wanted  so this is not true i thought the presidential requirement to was having been born on our soil i thought thats how john mccains birth in panama on a us based worked out technically us soil also obamas lineage in america extends back  years prior to the declaration of independence  his bloodline has been on this soil longer than this countrys even existedand yet somehow hes supposed to be the illegal alien  being questioned by people whos grandparents arrived in this country mostly at the tailend of the th centuryearly th century  the entire argument is pretty absurd just sake sanity couldnt snark not questions obamas citizenship making joke it if a democrat had made this crack im sure reddit would be spinning it in a positive light  something like biden jokes calls birthers racistconsidering romney has repeatedly said that obama is born in the us and the birth certificate thing is a settled issue im not inclined to think this was anything other than a joke it wasnt a joke it was pandering its called dogwhistle politicsit allows him to play it as innocuous notably even his campaign is not claiming it was a joke just that he was illustrating that he was born and raised here in michigan while getting another message across to the birther base of the party hes hitting the im more american than my opponent message and it makes sense with his extreme privilege and complete disconnect with the lives of the middle class hes a hard sell as the gw bush type of average joe american when you add to that the republican bases discomfort with his mormonism you can see how romney is left in a situation where he needs to pander to the base more than someone like gw bush did unfortunately for mitt his support is not very strong among independents right now either so he has to do his best to pander to the base while trying to not appear to actually agree with them to independents  theyre gonna put yall back in chains yes republicans are saying racist things even when you cant tell they are how convenient that that fits into the rpolitics narrative so nicely without the need for facts or evidence just bias and mind reading you are brainwashed if you cant tell that was a racist joke you are either lying or you dont catch on very quickly it could be interpreted a lot of ways you chose racist because youve always chosen the racist interpretation of everything else from the republicans so it fits your own deranged version of realitywe can talk about romneys racism when he makes something like thisno better time than black history month to pander to specific racial groups african americans for obama isnt a racist movement because it does not exist for the express purpose of raising one race up at the expense of another rather it is a movement to garner support from a particular demographic of society by recognizing the achievements of some people who could be categorized as part of that demographic meanwhile romney has made a joke about the fact that nobody wonders whether or not he was born in the usa to a stir up a crowd of republican base supporters many of whom either believe or wish that obama was not a natural born citizen b imply that there is nothing about him that would cause anyone to question whether he was born in the usa hrm lets see why people wonder whether obama was born in the usa because his father happens to be a black african and his mother married a southeast asian man and lived with him for a while and hrmwhat would make people wonder about obamas birthright but not romneys for whom there is just as much room for controversy could it becould it becould it just maybe bebecause romney is obviously whiteobamas birthplace is a subject of controversy mostly because he appears to be black joking about it to stir up a crowd of racist people is racist im not saying it is burning cross white cloak racism but it is racist yes and if romney made a group called whites for romney would you say that that would be racist be honestgt meanwhile romney has made a joke about the fact that nobody wonders whether or not he was born in the usa to your interpretation of the meaning of the joke is totally worthless how do you not understand this youre picking the interpretation that matches your preconceived notions and then adding it as more evidence that your preconceived notions are correctgt because romney is obviously whiteor because hes obviously from ma because he was governor theregt obamas birthplace is a subject of controversy mostly because he appears to be black joking about it to stir up a crowd of racist people is racist im not saying it is burning cross white cloak racism but it is racisti dont think obama is unqualified to be president but youve got to admit that the story of his birth is highly irregular its not that surprising that there would be questions about it if he was born in idaho would anyone care its the fact that its so weird that made it an issue in the first place its not like people are asking for the birth certificates of any other black politicianits not racist he just has a very unusual story about his birthlike i said you have taken the racist interpretation and then added that to your evidence that everything people on the right do is racist its a selfreinforcing theory because you continuously see the things the right does through the lens of racismbut hey its your own intellectual honesty you can destroy it however you want i never said it was racist i just said that he is trying to frame himself as more american than his opponent to pander to his base while trying to avoid turning off independents by throwing his hat in with the birthers im just attempting to analyze the politics of the statement i was under the impression thats what this subreddit existed forim not a democrat im just someone who is genuinely interested in the nuts and bolts of the political game do you really think candidates go around saying things like this without having a purpose for it without having thought through the implications thats just silly what i find most interesting is that romney who has long since rapped up the nomination and is officially heading into the general campaign soon is not pivoting more toward the center yet usually around this time candidates start pandering to their bases a lot less and start courting moderate independents but romney no not just based on this one statement appears to still be spending his time and effort shoring up his own partys base it seems that the romney campaign is still worried about republicans being lukewarm toward his candidacy i think this is going to drive their strategy i dont expect to see a high brow issues based campaign out of the romney camp i suspect that they are going to settle on a bash obama first promote our candidate second strategy to attempt to fire up their base not on vote romney but instead on nobama and the obama camp is not the kerry camp they will hit back and they will go low i think this could be one of the more entertaining contentious presidential campaigns weve seen in a while  gt i never said it was racist i just said that he is trying to frame himself as more american than his opponent to pander to his base while trying to avoid turning off independents by throwing his hat in with the birthers im just attempting to analyze the politics of the statement i was under the impression thats what this subreddit existed forwhether its about being more american or its about being racist my point still stands you presented your opinion as factand no discussing politics is not really what this subreddit is for its for gigantic liberal circlejerks and  of the time if you present an alternative view your comments are censored from view by downvotes so no its not about discussiongt im not a democrat im just someone who is genuinely interested in the nuts and bolts of the political game do you really think candidates go around saying things like this without having a purpose for it without having thought through the implications thats just sillyim not saying he didnt have a purpose im saying that youre presenting your interpretation of what that purpose is as factgt what i find most interesting is that romney who has long since rapped up the nomination and is officially heading into the general campaign soon is not pivoting more toward the center yethave you watched a romney speech or do you learn everything about what he does from this subreddit no offensei dont agree with his politics but he seems like a friendly and extremely intelligent person he actually seems like a huge nerd and his background would seem to support that belief unfortunately it doesnt take reddit spin to make the current gop seem bat shit insane there should be no doubt in anyones minds that the republicans either honestly believe obama is a muslim terrorist born in another country or they simply support their voters in believing in such ludicrous things simply because the ends justify the means which seems to be their current mottosecond of all and this is the most important part it doesnt matter what mitt romney believes as weve clearly seen with his flip flopping on huge issues like homosexuality he is willing to say anything to appeal to the beliefs of the crazy people and idiots that make up his voters and colleagues so while i doubt he believes obama wasnt born in the us there is no way he is joking when he says insane shit like that if biden joked that birthers are racist he would actually be telling the truth what the fuck are you smoking i agree doesnt the gop say enough crazy bullshit why should we make mountains out of molehills when there are legitimate mountains to address gtjust  days ago it was president obama getting in a notsosubtle dig at romney talking about wind power initiatives obama told an audience in iowa that romney had said you cant drive a car with a windmill on itgtgtnow i dont know if hes actually tried that the president continued hes had other things on his cargtgtthat would be a notsosubtle reference to romneys infamous dogonthecarroof storynpr  now theyre even romney gets in birth certificate quip its wrong there are numerous interviews with the attendees and many of them saw it exactly as supporting their birtherism some specifically calling obamas birth certificate fake and a photoshop gt if a democrat had made this crack im sure reddit would be spinning it in a positive light something like biden jokes calls birthers racistoh yeah that would be even funnier than theyre going to put yall back in chains classic biden ha ha what a  comedian heh ahhhhhh cringegt considering romney has repeatedly said a wide spectrum of things on any issue you care to choose to put it politely jokes arent necessarily harmless when its a white man subtly questioning the citizenship of a person of color for no logical reason other than to appeal to his racist audience he doesnt deserve a free pass it was a scumbag comment pure and simple ask yourself why would he do that because its akin to saying that your two parents the ones who ultimately support you are asking you for your birth certificate to verify that you were born where you said you wereseriously michigan is romneys home state hes making a joke that hes well established in the michigan community and that no one would think twice of where he was from people that are thinking this is anything but a joke is ridiculous im fairly liberal but i dont condone making a mountain out of a molehill the majority of the time rpolitics ends up being as sensationalist as the looney tea partiers something like this should be the top comment  jesus christmas  this whole thing is so stupid  i think youve completely missed the pointthe suggestion here is not that romney believes theres a legitimate issue with obamas birth certificate the suggestion is that this was a calculated manipulative and brilliantasshole political move romneys statement is perfectly formulated to remind everyone including his base and underinformed undecided voters that there are and have been questions lingering out there in the minds of some about obamas eligibility without actually raising those questions himselfis romney a loony birther no is romney a good politician in the middle of a campaign yes make no mistake he wasnt just making a joke had to come this far into the comments to get a decent response thanks for that still think romney is an asshat though copping a ple  a perfectly logical explanation  that dismisses the simple obvious truth of the matter is typical of apologists  oh he didnt mean it that way its just super convenient that the comment attracts these birthers to his lukewarm campaign ive tried this in a lot of different situations usually i just end up really confused and wondering if im the crazy asshole because romney needs people to believe hes just like one of them and it turns out normal people make jokes i seriously think this is just a mitt attempt at humor that backfired horribly because hes an idiot obama can tell any joke known to man and people think hes the funniest person but when romney tells a joke hes a bad guy well hes either a bad guy if he foresaw that many of his base would be happy to see it as a hey that other guy is black or a bad jokesmith he didnt realize the obvious implications of a birther joke  hes going to catch flak either way no its just that obama would never tell a crass racist joke in public as a way to pander to racist people yeah thats a complete fucking lie and you know it if the president told a joke as offensive as this fox news would run with it for the next month nonstop the offensiveness of it is an invention of your deranged mind i heard the audio clip of this not  minutes ago and it did sound like a joke to me  a bad joke buut a joke still  perhaps people who dont want to take it as a joke will not and that could possibly benefit them  who knows  who cares lol  its obviously just a joke a poorly thoughtout one though  the premise isnt even that unfunny given the context of him speaking to a crowd of people from his home state it seems as much a jab at the untrusting racists who vote for him as it is the expected lighthearted pandering to the home town folk  thought experiment if colbert made the same joke it might be funny his im color blind jokes are not terribly dissimilar though they are funnier  ps i hate romeny of course it is but thats not a very good basis for a massive circlejerk now is it yes obama has made birther jokes himself no one claimed obama was enlisted in the birther movement after those jokes some really questioned his naturalborn citizenship which is why he eventually released two birth certificates i doubt believes the birther crap and that he was just making a joke the sad part is he doesnt understand how ridiculous the whole thing makes him look of course no one has ever asked to see your birth certificate mitt your a rich white guy if anything his comment shows the subliminal racism at play in the birther movement i dunno but would you like a president who makes backhandedly racist jokes in pandering to a bunch of racist people what possible reason would there be to joke about such a thing fair question dont get me wrong you have my upvote but the funny part of this joke is the idea that we have a foreign born president if this is romneys attempt at comedy im twice as worried for the sake of humanity as i was before reading your comment

drug tested too i look at it this way if i go into an interview and only list my last year of employment and references instead of everything before it i should expect to be asked for more information or simply over looked for the positionhere we have romney a presidential candidate unwilling to produce his tax records and the republican party has the audacity to defend him and condemn those who question his tax records hes obviously looked at the consequences of withholding and releasing the returns and made his decision what bothers me is that even if he released his returns and they were impeccable hes still a horribly shitty candidate a person who gets called out on blatant lies and stands there confidently smiling and not cowering away in shame is a scary scary man to put in charge of a country  ive met some incredible straightforward great ceos ive met some people in the corporate world who have the worst kind of sociopathic tendencies they message massage the truth and will straight out lie when they know they wont get caught i know this fits the stereotypical definition of a politician but i find it troubling how gleefully romney bends the truth and is willing to take credit for work that is clearly not his work like the auto bailout when he laughed and tried to take credit for a policy that worked that he actively advocated against this is not the same thing as taking credit for a subordinates work in your office its beneath the dignity of the office of the presidencyhe has all the worst qualities of a certain kind of sociopathic corporate ceo which is one of the reasons im concerned about his taxesbut my main point is that people are already starting to conflate asking for his taxes as the same thing as asking obama to prove his birth and residency status even after providing proof and forgetting that the best proof that he was eligible was his tenure as a us senator asking romney to provide information that every presidential candidate from the republicans to democrats for decades should be perfunctory the fact that romney wants to hide this is troubling to say the least and above all its disgraceful hearing representatives who casually demanded proof of birth a few years ago dismiss this  i cant get over the irony that romneys dad started the tradition as a businessman running for office and insisted on doing more than one year since anyone can hide bad behavior over a short time the apple sure fell far from the tree mr wayne i dont think ive ever seen a better timed more relevant or entertaining comment in all my time on the internet gold star for you good sir editapparently not many batman begins fans around here  spoiler alert i love you the turnip fell far from the truck they had vastly different upbringings its no wonder willard is so craven and romney himself repeatedly harangued his opponents in massachusetts for failing to produce a complete tax history in all honesty im a registered republican would love nothing more than to see obama out of office but this irony bothers the shit out of me romney is a shitty candidate obama has not in any way shape or form gotten our country out of the hole its in see unemployment once again rising to  and our debt surpassing  trillion from the  trillion bush left us at not to mention the doctor shortage that is going to destroy our healthcare even further once  hits and obamacare becomes effective but im not convinced romney has any idea how to do it either well said but i have to call you on the senator qualification  you do not have to be a natural born citizen to be a us senator  i believe the constitution only specifies that for a president sorry youre right i should have included the part about his us passport that used his hawaii birth certificate as part of the application or pointed out the vetting process the secret service usesmy overarching point is that asking obama for his birth certificatequestioning his citizenship was wrong to begin with and is not the same thing as asking romney for his tax returns so in point of fact you must be able to prove that youre a natural born us citizen to be president  thats a legal matterits not a legal obligation to produce copies of ones tax returns but ill be damned if i dont view the two as equally important but really arent both sides worried about the same thing  namely ones ability to lead without external undue influencehell im a fiscally conservative leaning person and i still find myself believing that i mistrust the lack of tax disclosure even more regardless of what the law stipulates both bother me dont get me wrong but lets just talk worst reasonable case scenarios here for a second  worst case if obama is covering up a birth issue that would make him ineligible then we have a minor constitutional issue on our hands that gets resolved reasonably if ever proven whats the fear that hell go manchurian candidate on us and do something evil while in office i just dont buy that happening uncheckedcompared to  worst case romney has his hands in all sorts of cookie jars gets money from all sorts of unseemly players and exploits every tax loophole he can find i worry much more about the influence the corporate connections would have on ones ability to lead without external undue influence and both should be under legal scrutiny in my never to be humble opinion but yeah taxes are a much more serious deal to be clear i guess this was the point ive been unsuccessfully trying to make about the birther issue with obama its perfectly legitimate to require proof of eligibility to run for president my point is that specifically with obama it wasnt a reasonable fair thing to ask because by the time it became a campaign issue hed already proven it in multiple ways weve got this parallel earth running where obama stalled on producing his birth certificate until  the point was hed already proven he was a natural born us citizen multiple times before hed run which is why he was certified by the statesbut weve got this mythology now among a largerthanexpected segment of the population that has an alternate narrative for this historyand the point with romneys returns is that it speaks directly to his future policies which is why it matters and also to his character which also matters well said fiscal conservative doesnt mean you support tax havens or whatever else romney is trying to hide you make sense but why wasnt gwb hounded for  months for his long form birth certificate why wasnt any president before him hounded for it as well so in point of fact you must be able to prove that youre a natural born us citizen to be president  thats a legal matterbut this is kind of the point im trying to make obama had already proven it by the time it became a campaign issue thus it was wrong to question him about itespecially since mccain was the only one that was actually born outside of the us and i dont mean that last point as some kind of gotcha there was sr that was cosponsored by a few senators obama included in order to prevent mccain from going through any kind of birther nonsense himself  the worst case with romney to me is that he signed off on enron style accounting on his taxes if youre making the kind of money romney makes youre not as likely to get an audit how awful would that be we end up with a sitting president someone blows the whistle and it turned out he had committed a felony prior to being president im saying that earnestly and honestly it would be just as awful if it turned out obama had something like that in his past  actually worse case scenario is he was a felon who illegally hid money over seas and took part in the amnesty program i think most people with sense assume your worst case scenario do you think asking obama for his college transcript is a fair parallel the vetting process the secret service uses as a senator barack obama was on the foreign relations committee and the homeland security and government affairs committee you require high levels of security clearance for both of these committees barack obama was vetted by nonpartisan agencies to make sure he was who he said he was and was not some muslim spy attacking us from within if he were not an american citizen it would have been discovered before he ever worked with either of those committees  you can be born outside the us and still be a us senator presidents cannot try again birthers are ridiculous and the controversy is made up bullshit to disguise  thinly  unadulterated racism that said president obamas time as a senator would not at all prove hes eligible for the presidency to run for senate or the house one does not need to be a naturally born citizen of the united states im not saying romney is a sociopath but hes definitely a lot like a sociopath  its as if zapp brannigan were running for president i absolutely agree  i was watching a series of interviews with romney and kept hearing phrases that sounded like im not going to say what i would or would not do if i were or were not elected only slightly exaggerating but thats what it sounded like  i kept thinking that was exactly the type of thing i would hear dysfunctional ceos sayya i want tax records  hell i want any and all information thats available on any candidate  if a candidate doesnt want to provide complete openness and transparency before getting my vote there are millions more candidates for me to consider upvote for using the word conflate  and for making salient points   i am convinced that a significant fraction of people saying that he wasnt born in the united states when polled also think hawaii is a country  it makes me feel slightly better did you see the tv spot obama put uphis pr team is pretty legit that change campaign was the best advertisement scheme in awhile gtlike the auto bailout when he laughed and tried to take credit for a policy that workeddefine worked in this context i cant recall the study but i recall the result showing most leaders have sociopathic tendencies now i have to spend a bunch of time hunting that down relevant video i dont think perfunctory is the word you were looking for   youd be surprised at how easily it is to lie straightfaced to someone when youve already convinced yourself that the bullshit youre going to feed someone is the truth you dont truly believe it as truth but if you can put enough of yourself behind it and sell it your face will never give you awayi have a family member that ive since disowned because he is a compulsive liar im to the point that i genuinely feel bad for him because its obviously some sort of mental defect he gets himself so convinced that the lie is truth that calling him out on it is a poor idea ive nearly had physical altercations that wouldve required third party intervention after seeing him blow up after being called on his bullshit hes somewhere on a psychopathic level and has a sense of entitlement to everything and everyone he encounters if he can worm his efforts into something he automatically thinks hes entitled to it it blows my mindfortunately ive learned his game and i play it to my advantage ive used him to get things for myself and it didnt benefit him at all then when it comes time for a favor in return i tell him to go fuck himselfthe best part is that he once ran for a political position where he was living at the time years ago he lost but he was the perfect person for such a lively circus of bullshittery you cant bullshit a bullshitter but sometimes you can lead them along and then pull a bait and switch in my case i just replace the bait with absolutely nothingi swear im not bitter or anything just jaded towards people its safe to say that trust no one applies to my daily thought process psychopathy is very common among ceos and their ilk they say that the upper echelons of the corporate world is where youll find the most psychopaths and this extends to some degree into areas such as politics one of the signs of a psychopath is one that lies with a smile and has no regard for the consequences of their actions but has a lot to hide theres every chance that romney is literally a psychopath fox and friends had trump on the phone this morning they arent just birthers anymore they want everything obama has sealed college applications and grades ect gteven after providing proof and forgetting that the best proof that he was eligible was his tenure as a us senatornot to nitpick but being senator only requires you to live in the united states for a certain number of years only those born in america are allowed to be president that was the whole point in asking the president for his birth certificate if obama was born in hawaii before it was a state he would have been ineligible to be presidenthowever the fact that he was able to run and actually get into the race under one of the major parties means that all these things were good the birther movement was just a bunch of conspiracy theorists that got too big in their britches it was the old we dont like this guy so he cant win what he won well he obviously cheated all we have to do is prove it gtand above all its disgraceful hearing representatives who casually demanded proof of birth a few years ago dismiss this but what about obamas freshman english  scores s sounds like steve jobs what do you think of this pictureof mitt romney what really bothers me is that even if his tax returns were full of fraudulent activities no one that was already going to vote for him would care as a very toned down republican im very ashamed that this is what was chosen the man doesnt even have a soul his bold faced lies and complete lack of remorse make him a perfect candidate for a sociopath not the leader of the us forgive my digression but when i read your comment i thought isnt it baldfaced liesa quick google revealed that it is apparently back in the day people wore beards to conceal their face so they could lie better a baldfaced liar is so good at lying they didnt need beards sorry for the off topic post but thought i would share a relevant til now i dont know whether i should shave my beard or not  dont shave but lie that you did  thank you til x  til something somewhat interesting  but both would be reasonable phrases  the more you know this is an awesome til actually both formsare attested from the early s and most of the nonusa world uses barefaced lie instead which is slightly earlier so it would be odd to consider boldfaced incorrectthe other commenters talking about eggcorns are correct but bald faced is probably an eggcorn for barefaced in this context i never knew that growing up in rural arkansas ive only heard bold faced but dont worry folks im not one of the antigay hit you in the face with my bible southerners im actually an atheist and a supporter of gay marriage as a mormon i am super depressed that people are going to think that is what we are all like i miss the good old days having lived the first  years of my life never meeting a mormon and the next  knowing many moved to az i can only offer condolences  its true this is going to suck for you guys  your rep is already tenuous probably because the entire culture is based around a series of extremely obvious scandals and scamsseriously chaucerian fraud everyone knows itmormonism is like a case study in how crazy a thing you can get an otherwise serious person to say in public without throwing up from embarrassment i suppose the us is fertile ground for such inanity considering the charmed position faith uncontaminated by evidence holds in our societyah meits too bad as that mormons are generally pretty decent friendly people in a less guarded moment i might have the inclination to say that if there were a heaven mormons probably ought to go therethen id remember the horrific bullshit of funneling extorted millions to another state to repeal a progressive law that had no effect on utah whatsoeverafter remembering that id pour myself two fingers of scotch and go back to mincing about the house i grew up in a town with a ton of mormons and the kids ran to two extremes goody two shoes or mad criminals protected by their parents standing in the communitymitt strikes me as the worst of both sides i read the book of mormon before going to utah for a week and was worried that i was going to spend all the time fighting off missionaries and trying to find a drink instead i had a wonderful holiday met some of the most generous and kindspirited people in the us romney is certainly not a typical mormon by any manner of means and huntsman was by far the best republican candidate the good ol days i didnt say the really good ol days did it work for you as an exmormon i appreciate your humor  romney hasnt made any effort to explain his relationship with his churchfaith we could all use a lesson on this and other religions that the bulk of americans know little to nothing about the less we know about him the less we will know about you the problem is that under these circumstances we all start to make assumptions that dont necessarily do anybody any good yeah kind of sad even though it did say he paid  million in charity aka tithing in my lifetime ive never noticed a difference some would say they go handinhand  the problem with the reps right now is that the loudest ones are usually the nutjobs and radicals they are really destroying themselves from within and itll be interesting if they go fullretard in  or if they scale back the crazy reps are the party of the old ways are best and it just cant be like that progress is the way of the world for this reason i am surely not voting for him and one of the best responses is to vote for his prime opponent  it is sad that he survived as the gops top pick but that also shows just how bad his opposition was toothe basic truth was that the good candidates all saw that obama was doing a good enough job to be formidable as an incumbent and they all stayed out i agree  while ive seen no one mention it yet consider the impression our children get by watching mitts pathological lying or worse the life lesson they might adopt if he wins the presidency after using every underhanded political trick deception and manipulation imaginableleaders set examples for society but im sickened by the example  mitt sets for the future leaders of the country and business community  our country and business community are greatly diminished by promoting ethicallymorally challlenged people into leadership positions  mitts exploits as head of bain capital serve as prime examplesgeorge washington an honest and decent man must be spinning in his grave over the romney presidential candidacy sociopaths tend to do exceptionally well with foreign policy not so much with domestic welcome to the primary process  i was precisely a kerry fan eitherwise  somehow the entire party of democrats managed to pick a complete lemonand now its your turn lol thanks itll be a cold day in hell before he gets my vote so count one more for your side  ive got news for you if youre a very toned down republican you are not a republican what is it that you agree with tax cuts for the rich tax hikes for the middle class and slashed programs for the poor teaching the controversy accusing the president of being a muslim accusing the president of not being an american austerity during a depression talking about dangerous cuts to defense when we are still by far and away the leading military spender in the world corporations are people no abortions ever not even in cases of rape and incest laws requiring brown people to show their papers no stem cell research you could go on forever these arent ideas held just at the extremes of the party this is the republican party accept it dude chill your shit  maybe not technically a sociopath but definitely a textbook businessman though the line between those two is often blurred he smiles pretty for the camera and is pretty adept at making money saying and doing anything he can to achieve that objective no offence but who was your other viable candidate i still feel romney was the best pick in this election for the republicans  i dont see anyone right now beating obama so throw someone under the bus   interestingly enough many top ceos are sociopaths because they dont care about the consequences of their actions against people and will do anything to get to the top bain capital took that pathological demeanor and sharpened it to a cruel point putting his dog on the top of the car is another example mitt is really bad news for the country and the fact that the right supports him unconditionally just shows how divorced from reality some of them are im glad to see that youre not in that camp  i dont think republicans are exactly ecstatic about him as a candidate they are more than they are for obama they are terrified of obama it truly is genuine fear for themedit formatting use two asterisks two in front two after to bold things theyve already stated repeatedly that the main objective of the gop right now is to make sure obama isnt reelected not the economy social issues etc its make sure the nigger isnt back in the white house they really are afraid of him because hes a sign of things to come the republicans are going to keep putting out worse and worse candidates more farright radicals when they should be holding off on the crazy and be more centristright again terrifiedone of the best articles i have read about this phenomenon well then they can experience the fear democrats and sane persons dealt with under eight years of dick and bush i could not have said this any better and thats what frightens me mostthe people who vote against someone simply because theyre a democrat or a republicanour system isnt exactly the best for that either none of the above might beat romney in nevada was going to upvote you but youre currently at  points and i for some reason at this moment find that kind of beautifulps  im not even high happy caek day yeah theyll still vote for him though because people in this country put ego before intelligence im certainly not as a libertarianconservative  i definitely feel like the republicans have already thrown in the hat and surrendered  and are focusing on  hes the republican john kerryanyone but bush becomes anyone but obamahes not gonna winand as a fellow libertarianconservative i assume you mean fiscal who doesnt really care about the hot button issues abortion gay marriage drugs i mean come on just let people do what they wanna do until it hurts someone else i dont think theres really a viable party for us anymorenote if you meant social conservative instead of fiscal im not really sure how those go together and am thoroughly confused  so i assumed fiscal yeah im fiscally conservative and socially liberalindifferent  which means i pretty much think the government should just equally stay out of it in most cases   honestly this really seems like its the case they werent happy with mccain back in  they were actually cutting funding to his campaign because they didnt want him to win the primaries then once he won they molded him into a ball of crazy that is the head of the republican partythey didnt want romney now either hes not trustworthy hes a borderline pathological liar and hes just so ungenuine the republicans and democrats dont really oppose each other we really arent they sure dont like ron paul as an alternative which by the way completely pisses me off  thats the strength of the republican party  they organize during the playoffs they hate all the other teams but when its time for the playoffs they congeal into a single mass if they win the stick together even moreon the other side the democrats can organize occasionally to win but once they cross the finish line they all head their separate ways and cant accomplish anything as a grouptoo bad neither party puts much effort into representing voters they just keep distracting the public with the same old the other side is evil play while they work for the benefit of themselves ive been telling people for awhile that this election reminds me a lot of the  election just with the parties reversed in  i know a lot of democrats including me thought they wouldnt have much trouble beating gw but ended up losing because we chose a guy that even democrats had a hard time being enthusiastic about never underestimate the subconscious need of white people to rule dark people i like turtles the fundraising numbers say otherwise anybody over obama it doesnt matter who the puppet is the rich are certainly going to back romney  hes their people  yet he is seriously out of touch with the blue collar working man  i used to be in the camp of anyone elseanyone else  but when it finally came down to our real choices i became disenchanted  most republicans i talked to think romney already released  years worth of returns im not even sure how they got that number fox news never talks about how many years of returns he released they just say he did more than enough  they may be thinking of romney releasing  years to the mccain campaign back in  for them to vet him for running as mccains vicepresidential running mate for the  election  naturally fox news watching republicans would get the actual details pretty confusedso he did technically release them but not publicly  well the mccain campaign looked at his tax returns then they picked sarah palin  that only makes me doubt him more if they thought palin was a better option than himedit  yes everyone i get it  selecting presidential and vicepresidential candidates is a complicated process  i was just trying to get me somodat romney bashing karma goodness  is that so badalso to bookwormy if romneys records are public then show them to me  that should be an easy enough task for a bookworm  here are  years of president barack h obamas tax returns and only  of romneys its fucking terrifying that mccain picked palin over romney and romney is now running for president and i live in australia too bad our version of romney is ahead in the polls here hey hey hey hey  i do not like tony abbott  at all  i cannot stand the man  i dont like jgills either but thats beside the point  as much as i despise abbott he is no romney  thankfully willard gave mccain  years of tax returns mccains a rich guy hes entitled you wouldnt want a bunch of plebs pawing through them with their dirty hands then mccain should come out and say there isnt anything wrong with his tax returns mccain also could go before congress the press whoever and say ive seen mitt romneys tax returns and he has paid taxes and completely ruin harry reids reputation hes not doing that i would love to learn that someone from mccains camp leaked his tax returns with the democrats that isnt entirely fair palin was the republicans horrible response to hillary clinton it wasnt clear how bad she was until she got a national forum thats why her book didnt do so well i heard obama released  yrs worth  now im not a fan of palin by a long way but ive heard this statement about her and him an innumerate number of times now and i would just like to say she was a woman seriously every single western government has female candidates in high ranking positions to appeal to the feminine vote however many people were involved in the selection process i dont know but i bet they unanimously agreed that her being female was a major selling point and to boot the word was that she was to garner independents who were pissed that hillary lost to obama  because clearly hillary and sarah were peers in every sense of the word s    as a woman i was totally offended that republicans chose her   every woman should have been   god i hate that some group agreed that american women are so selfcentereddumb that as long as the gop put a bimbo up front theyd get the vote yeah but thats not sound logic they picked palin because of a perceived demographic failing appeal to female voters rather than the unacceptable nature of romneys taxes this is like saying i wore the blue shirt in that interview and didnt get the job i wont  make that mistake again there were other greater determining factors  to be fair there is no evidence that the reason palin was picked was based in this people heard that the mccain campaign looked at romneys returns since he wasnt chosen an assumption was made that this was the reasonwithout any proof at all mccain needed someone to draw votes in theoretically romney would have helped picked less votes than palin palin was a wild card that mccain chose to get more votes the whole thing was that whoever won would make history and mccain was gambling on the voters choosing a female vp over a african american president obviously that gamble didnt pay off due to palin being a walking gaffe your type of thinking is troublesome you infer romney wasnt picked because of hid tax returns which is purely speculation without no backing  why should i show them you already have that info did you not read or hear the irs said he paid everything due and gave millions to charity no i guess its because the msm didnt report it what about reid he refuses to releases his as well how about obamas sealed college records how come the left wasnt demanding them i would say if obama releases his college records then romney should release more tax returns but really why should this even matter i want to know more about the important issues that will affect me and my family not if romney or obama released their taxes gt  why should i show them you already have that info i dont have that info  i only know of  years of filed taxes  where are the other  years to which the op was referring  because if they are public then they should be easy to find  if you dont know where they are then how can i believe you about them being publicgt did you not read or hear the irs said he paid everything due and gave millions to charity no i guess its because the msm didnt report iti am going to guess you know about that because fox news told you so  fox news is the msm  so the msm did report it  i dont watch fox so boohoogt how about obamas sealed college records how come the left wasnt demanding themwhat about them  we allready have  years of tax returns an autobiography by the president his birth certificate and a whole bunch of other crap about his life  all this whining about his college transcripts is just pathetic grasping at strawsgt what about reid he refuses to releases his as wellreid isnt running for president  it is a tradition for presidential candidates to release their tax forms for public scrutiny  gt  i would say if obama releases his college records then romney should release more tax returnsdeal  as soon as romney releases  years of his tax returns obama will release his college transcripts  i am glad we can agree on somethinggt but really why should this even matteryou are right his college transcripts shouldnt matter i dont think anyone actually read the tax returns i noticed a few things one romney is a rich bastard but he at least paid taxes for two years  the claim harry reid brought out is he hasnt paid taxes in ten years two if he hadnt paid taxes dont you think the irs would be in hog heaven prosecuting him for it ive seen them ruin a mans life and send him to prison for an honest mistake dont you think theyd be like dogs to a bone if they could take a presidential candidate down a notchthree take a look at obamas tax returns in  when he became a senator he lists his combined family wages as  when his  combined wages were  the current senatorial wage is  a year but there is no mention of michelle getting a new job in  so where does the rest of the k come from additionally in  they listed  in business income when they had  business income or loss from  for a total household income that jumped from  in  to  the hell where did the money magically come from how many entrepreneurial business boasted a million in profits its first year from nothing the year before if it was a small business why isnt he boasting about that if he really did create a business from nothing i want to know so i can get rich and fund my presidential campaign too gt the claim harry reid brought out is he hasnt paid taxes in ten years two if he hadnt paid taxes dont you think the irs would be in hog heaven prosecuting him for itill explain it to you  romney has obviously filed his tax forms with the irs for the past  years harry reid is saying that thanks to the way our tax system is setup with all its deductions exceptions tax breaks for the rich etc  romney has paid zero money to the irs taxes overall during the past  years  the implications of this being how can he complain about taxes being too high and the rich deserving tax breaks when he doesnt even pay taxes thanks to the system being rigged in his favorgt there is no mention of michelle getting a new job in  so where does the rest of the k come fromi dont freaking know ask him if you want to knowgt additionally in  they listed  in business income when they had  business income or loss from  for a total household income that jumped from  in  to  the helli still dont know but i am willing to bet a couple national best selling books could explain it or you could send the president an email asking for his advice dudley doright if its in the newspaper it must be true some would say republicans are citing information that isnt true   at this point willard could eat a dead baby on national television and still get close to the same amount of votes if he did not  people who vote for him arent voting for candidate romney they are voting against candidate obama president obama ftfy same here and imo its because they dont like having a black man in the white house  i just cant think of any other reason for the hatred what really bothers me is people who actually want to vote for this assclown  that my friend is the scary part on the other foot would anyone voting for obama care if his was full of fraudulent activities four years ago yes i would to a greater extent i think then again who knows yeah that would be a pretty big deal  of course we would luckily nothing has shown up is there a reason why you dont care if romneys done anything wrong i doubt his tax returns would reveal any fraud at all but i bet they do showcase pretty much every trick in the book that the wealthy use to avoid paying any of them  i actually disagree with that i think romneys tax returns would show millions upon millions of dollars worth of assets that are being manipulated in some very sophisticated ways to reduce his tax liability while this kind of tax planning is really nothing more than a reasonable person would expect from someone with these kinds of assets romneys enemies on both the right and the left would make a heyday out of every little dodge and investigate the legitimacy of every exemption not that some of that wouldnt be understandable and even necessary but as with anything lately it would be blown way out of proportion and romney wouldnt have enough time to do damage control before the election independents undecideds nail on the head right here whatever the records say they would change frightfully few minds  his lying with conviction may be scary but its no more scary than the flimsy reasons some people will vote on we live in a country where hitler could rerise to power under another name all he would need to do is run on the anti gay marriage all abortions illegal return to christian values platform and be white  aaaaannnnd godwins law look its obvious that you think that christians are backwards and hateful people but even when hitler did come to power there were christians like dietrich bonhoeffer who fought the nazis to their deaths christianity was not the cause of hitlers rise to power in the same way that islam is not responsible for  in blaming an entire group for actions that might occur from a few you have become the very ignorance you so fervently detest  did you read his original post at all or did you gloss over it halfway through nobody here stated that christianity allowed the rise of hitler if thats what you read from it i seriously suggest you reread his post slower this time perhapshes making an analogy that the current voter base is biased and stupid and that they would vote for anything that would suit their desires and i was making an analogy that showed that it is rather ignorant to blame a group on the whole for actions of a few  you dont have to detest christians to realize this  when fascism comes to america it will come wrapped in a flag and carrying a cross in its hand  that is a misquote from someone whose name i cant remember  the point is that its not about christianity its about fascism  the current move toward fascism in this country is disguised as christianity patriotism and free enterprise  it is none of those it is just plain old idiocy and plain old fascism  crristofascism i call it sinclair lewis i believe i always heard it attributed to sinclair lewis but apparently there is no proof he said it   it is significant that many of the leaders of these movements fascism from mussolini down and including laval and quisling began as socialists and ended as fascists or nazis fa hayek this is a legitimate quote and i still dont really know what it means i think hayek is saying that fascism can come because of lots of different reasons either as a reaction to failure or as the end game of original policies  i am not sure that fascism will come i think there are enough of us to prevent it  cross your fingers you made that leap not me i was making the point that a hate platform will work with your pals if you dont like that fact its not my problem the fuck did you just imply that op is relating christianity to nazism plx reread the op upvote for post and username  those who supported hitler were overwhelmingly protestant christians that doesnt meant that the leadership of nsdap was christian but it means that his message had appeal to salt of the earth conservatives who went to church everyday as opposed to the factory workers in hamburg or unemployed in berlin who didnt care about christianity and voted for the social democrats or communists jesus though godwins law everywhere up in this bitch calm down guys of course not all christians fought nazis some helped them omg thank you thank you for being the few who realize this gtchristians are backwards and hateful peoplesome of them are anyway  some christians by which i mean people who will say yes when you ask them are you christian will happily vote for someone who wants to kill gays or muslims or pornographers or whatever  some christians will openly advocate restrictions on freedom of speech or assembly or a change in our democratic rights or the mass imprisonment of certain groups  these are not uncommon beliefs among american christianssure you can talk all you like about how christianity is a peaceful loving religion and that jesus is such a cool guy  but thats not what i care about  what i care about is the population of americans that appear to have fascist beliefs most of whom claim to be christian  so when we complain about christian extremism we are not talking about peaceful loveydovey christians we are talking about the other kind that is right some of them anyone who says or thinks that they have never done anything hateful is lying to themselves i am just as appalled at the way christians can act as you are perhaps even more so however grouping them all together and labeling them all as backwards and hateful really doesnt help the situation if ignorance is concerning to you this is a step in the wrong direction christian extremists are people too while they may be misled dont you think that the best reaction to have to their hatred would be to not hate them you can hate what they believe you can hate the things they do and say and sometimes you absolutely should but then label those things as hateful and not the people a coward is incapable of exhibiting love it is the prerogative of the brave mahatma gandhi  im as leftwing as they come but calm down with the hyperbole those positions are all liabilities at this point the republican candidates who do the worst relative to their districts or states partisan lean are the christian values types see santorum bachmann musgrave alan keyes etc america isnt only the bible belt you know im more afraid of mitt romney than i am of rick santorum mitt romney appears fairly reasonably when his fiscal policies would ruin us rick santorum rightfully comes off as a loon and the voters know it  dude godwins law you lose the argument by default   for the uninformed and uninitiated here ya go while an automatic loss of argument is the most commonly held corollary to godwins lawit is unfortunately also an example of the fallacy fallacy quite  i believe its supposed to be amusing not good logic  neat novelty account by the way that wont ever happen  we do have some serious issues in america but a rise of another hitler is not one of them  we tend to view the media sensationalism leftright divide as a good portrait of our country but all it really succeeds in doing is covering the two sides of the venn diagram where the middle overlap is quite a bit larger than either side  the majority of americans who do not approve of homosexual marriage would still never agree to kill them easy now thats a bit ridiculous my friend sigh so much hate from a party thats supposed to be antihate bush is a nazi lets bring that back but lody dont call obama a socialistic thats racist captain hypocrisy awwwaaaaaaayyy never linked bush and nazi you need to improve your reading comprehension before you hand out naval awards and it came to pass  it goes to show just how idealogically divided the country is that a steaming pile of shit can run against someone as good as obama and still get about half the vote well considering the polls show that this line of attack has not swayed very many voters at all id say there is very little consequence for him to continue to withhold them if hes smart and if there isnt anything too harmful in them he could wait for the democrats to go on and on about his terrible secrets and then just do a document dump some time in late october nullifying the argumentbut in general the richer you are the more complicated your tax returns are romney is quite rich and his taxes are probably quite complicated  especially the ones he did before he was really running for president even if theres nothing actually bad in there im sure theres at least something somewhere that could be made to look bad oh shit  you just made me realize hes the smilertransmetropolitan i totally agree  obama must be removed immediately   what bothers me is that nobody cares about the legitimacy of the documents obama produced for his birth certificate and the complete unwillingness to discuss the issue in the first placefurther if the presidency should be treated as a job interview drug testing and all then how did obama with his notorious cocaine use become president clearly this is an issue that his supporters care about enforcing only on their opponents and hypocritically disparage legitimate claims against their own candidate  reddit will tell themselves anything to make sure their political views are pushed he studied at the shaggy school of diplomacy yeah and if he weighed both those options and thought it better to withhold them even after all this pressure means that he has something huge to hide  dont people see that it is directly proportionate how bad peple want to see them is outweighed by whayver hes hiding frankly its scary  hes saying whatever people can dream up intheir wildest fantasies is better than what is really on those pieces of paper well the blatant lying is pretty much all around these days so gthes still a horribly shitty candidatethis is true but there are a lot of republicans who actually like him when pressed on why they defend a vague notion of track records but ultimately they like him because hes rich and whitei feel this is a huge difference between democrats and republicans  years ago dems didnt like kerry  but they voted for him anyway republicans are unwilling to admit they have a shitty candidate on their hands and blindly see him as awesome because he made money doing immoral but profitable acts gtif i go into an interview and only list my last year of employment and references instead of everything before it i should expect to be asked for more information or simply over looked for the positionim not a supporter of romney and i think he should release tax records for at least the last  years but your analogy actually supports romneys positionwe know romneys employment and references for his entire adult life which is more than i provide when i apply for a job i dont submit my tax records when i apply for a jobrunning for president is not the same thing as applying for a job im not going to vote for obama because i like his resume and because he interviews well im going to vote for him because hes competent hes not corrupt and his political views mesh with mine to an acceptable degree if i were closer politically to romney than to obama id be voting for him the only reason for wanting to see the tax records is to ensure that romney isnt corrupt so that people who are undecided can make an informed choice the only reason for wanting to see the tax records is to ensure that romney isnt corrupt so that people who are undecided can make an informed choice  not true  it is one reason but there is also another  a person as rich as him who is benefiting so much from things the government does infrastructure regulation public education etc should not be paying minimal taxes  he most assuredly should not be paying almost nothing  if he is paying even less than the  that he already admits to while middle class people are paying much much more that is a moral failing  people need to know that even if he was following the strict letter of the law  it is an indication that he is a functioning sociopath who only wants to feather his own nest at everyone elses expense  not the kind of person we need as city councilman much less president     gt while middle class people are paying a higher percentage of their incomeftfy we already know how moral romney is hes the kind of person who would hold someone down beat the crap out of them and shave their head because theyre gay then  years later after the guy committed suicide try to laugh it off on national tv romney is a piece of shit and anyone who votes for him should have their head examined holy shit that happened i had no idea how have i missed reddit talking about this gtnot true it is one reason but there is also another a person as rich as him who is benefiting so much from things the government does infrastructure regulation public education etc should not be paying minimal taxesthats a good argument for raising tax rates for the rich raising capital gains taxes and closing loopholes its not a good argument for voting against romney if romney were the candidate pushing for a more progressive tax system more action to combat global warming economic stimulus womens and gay rights and expanded access to healthcare i would be voting for him i wouldnt much care what rate of tax he had been paying for the past few years you just quoted the gordo disagreed with his statement and then completely restated the quote using more words doesnt make a different argument  not true paying minimal taxes is what we all do if we can help it yes it would be awesome if the alternative minimum tax was altered on top incomes to make the game fair but calling him a sociopath is roughly equivalent to calling obama a kenyan because the genetic rules make him halfblack  as theyve mentioned cabinet members disclose more to the legislature than romney hasnot to mention his single past disclosure came during the primaries because he risked losingthat is the calculus will he lose scary you know i kinda have a problem wrapping my head around all this stuff two million and eight hundred thousand dollars according to democratic campaign ads that is how much romney payed in taxes this year to differentiate my parents total income before taxes was roughly thirty four thousand for federal income tax they payed  that equates to five thousand and one hundred dollars so uh romney payed  times as much in taxes as my parents my parents have three kids in the public school system and two that got through college on government funded grants now correct me if im wrong but wouldnt romney s kids be going through a private school and be having college payed out of pocket so im just confused its not fair he should be paying more than five hundred times as much money as another household in taxes  one that also got  or their taxes back due to deductions can someone enlighten me as to why its unfair to my parents im so confused the feeling of unfairness stems from the belief that the rich have benefitted more from the this country than the middle and lower classes and therefore should pay more back into it proportionality also comes into play here if someone who makes  million pays  of his money into taxes his quality if life is not greatly impacted whereas  of your familys  whould ruin themi think those who feel the most cheated by this tax issue are in the middle class specifically those who do not make enough to hire people to take advantage of the tax laws to cut what they would otherwise have to pay there is basically a line where once someone makes enough income their tax rate effectively goes down those on the worse side of this line who are only seeing their taxes hurt more with each extra dollar they make feel cheated thats crap  if the tax codes say he pays  and he proceeds to pay  theres nothing remotely immoral about that  even if hes doing through loopholes as long as its legal theres nothing remotely immoral about wanting to keep your own money yes but when you have so much of it you should be giving some back to the government to help them do things for the countryi really think hes hiding money from the mormon church those people are worse than scientology when it comes to collecting as a mormon youre supposed to donate  of your income to the church im pretty damn sure romney hasnt donated his fair share i think that there should be a spirit of the law vs letter of the law for the moral values here and while the letter of the law might say  the spirit definitely doesnt i think youll find that a lot of people on this site and in the world frankly disagree with you myself included there is a sizeable chasm between morality and legality there are many who would argue that paying so little in taxes represents a failure of our tax code to do its job and that a responsible citizen would not go to such lengths to game the system as it were gt there is a sizeable chasm between morality and legalityi agree in many cases im talking specifically about taxes  theres nothing immoral about obeying the law about how much money the government forces you to give them and thus not having to give them as muchgt there are many who would argue that paying so little in taxes represents a failure of our tax code to do its job and that a responsible citizen would not go to such lengths to game the systemyour first statement here and your second one dont relate  i agree  that itd be a failure of our tax code its the reason i want it gone and redone that doesnt mean that a responsible person should then give more to the government because of that  frankly given what the government currently does with the money it takes that anyone that gives more than they have to is crazy theres so much better things they could donate their money to i might be alone here but i categorically reject the notion that its okay to avoid paying ones fair share in taxes just because the government would have wasted it anyway what about the many many facets of government that arent wasteful what about the things your government does and desperately needs funding for that would never ever be completed by private industry government might not be a perfect machine but until it is theyre the guys im going to trust to build roads and schools and police the use of wireless spectrum and any of the other  literally  hundreds of thousands of things nobody else will take care of because theres no money in it and until that happens im going to pay my government what i feel is my moral obligation in line with what others pay of their compensation not what is literally legally required of me and not a penny more because that is selfish and thats just how i feel thats crap if you find every loophole you can to pay less taxes that is immoral youre evading what common sensethe law tells you to do in favor of a grey legal area way to get out of paying more taxes it is by definition corrupt gt if you find every loophole you can to pay less taxes that is immoral nope keeping your own money is not immoral  id even argue that given what the federal government spends its money on that its immoral to voluntarily give more to themgt youre evading what common sensethe law tells you to do in favor of a grey legal area way to get out of paying more taxesevading and avoiding are two different things ones illegal  also were not talking grey areas capital gains are  definedgt it is by definition corruptnot any definition that the rest of us recognize by the rest of us you mean you a legal loophole that is not intended is like abusing a glitch in a video game to beat others it is the creators fault but you take advantage of it for unfair gain that is still wrong and this is where the tax system breaks down and socioeconomical disparity becomes worse  our tax system is so heavily slanted in favor of the poor its not even funny  im sorry but this isnt an example of where its broken and spreads the disparity   ok maybe this is just my socialist pov is seeping out wups  depends on the loopholes hes using if its offshore bank evasion then that is such however i strongly suspect that theres simply major political backlash in a revelation that the system itself is flawed enough to allow him to pay minuscule tax rates considering he is presently advocating even greater tax cuts at the high end of the income distribution i disagree with your premise that if something is legal or if you can get if away with it that somehow then its ok and moral slavery for instance legal for a long time never moral and this is why ive never said that everything legal is immoral  i was talking about tax codelast i checked that has nothing to do with slavery it is immoral but not illegal  except many rich people have spent the last  years breaking down the laws that made taxes fair and thoroughly ass fucking our working class and economy in generalsooo yeahif you dont see that as immoral then you sir are no better than them um our income tax is inherently unfair against the wealthy  in fact most people would say this is as it should be  wanting it to go back to being closer to fair isnt immoral  but hey why understand the taxes when you can instead insult all of your opposition insults have always done great at progressing political discourse what if youre clamoring for your own tax rate to go down  are you saying that wanting to lower your tax rate is immoral benefiting yourself at the cost of others without any relevant difference other than your selfinterest is immoral to me  gtthats crap if the tax codes say he pays  and he proceeds to pay  theres nothing remotely immoral about thatit becomes immoral because he is advocating for policies that seek to lower his tax rate even further financing that even lower tax rate by raising taxes on the more than  of the population which make significantly less and cutting entitlement programs that benefit the poora person with millions in the bank looking to enrich themselves even further at the cost of programs for the poor is an immoral assholei dont care what political persuasion you arehe feels that the us owes him not the other way around gt it becomes immoral because he is advocating for policies that seek to lower his tax rate even furtherthe tax rate on the top  of our populace is currently very high while its not what it once was its disproportionate to their income  some people disagree with this arguing that it should be lower isnt immoral eithergt financing that even lower tax rate by raising taxes on the more than  of the population which make significantly less and cutting entitlement programs that benefit the poorthis is bullshit not even joking  the bottom  of our income earners note this isnt even all of the population arent even paying taxes  this statement by you shows that you dont have a clue how taxes are paid in the usgt a person with millions in the bank looking to enrich themselves even further at the cost of programs for the poor is an immoral assholegotcha anyone that disagrees with you as to how to help the poor is immoral  it must be real easy to choose a candidate if the opposition is all immoral assholes to you gtthe tax rate on the top  of our populace is currently very high while its not what it once was its disproportionate to their income some people disagree with this arguing that it should be lower isnt immoral eitherfirst because the us employs a progressive taxing system everybody has an equal tax liability for equivalent income levelsthe top  have the same amount of tax liability for the first  of their income as someone that earns  a year same tax liability for both period it is the income over  for an individual that gets taxed at the highest rate so if a person earns  in salaried income they are only paying the top percentage rate on the  in excess of  so for that additional  income that person would pay an additional  in income tax keeping a little over obviously whatever the published income tax rate is the top  arent paying it their effective tax rate is significantly lower than whatever the top tax bracket is mainly because most of their earnings come from capital gains and secondarily because they can afford to hire teams of accountants and lawyers to find every single loophole possiblegtthis is bullshit not even joking the bottom  of our income earners note this isnt even all of the population arent even paying taxes false the bottom  does not pay income tax they are still responsible for payroll sales gas liquor etc etc taxes which by the way affects them disproportionally more because of their low incometop earners that derive their income from some type of salary only pay payroll taxes on their first  of income i think thats the right number and no payroll taxes on capital gainsgtthis statement by you shows that you dont have a clue how taxes are paid in the usi believe that this is referred to as a projection i have an above average grasp of the system of taxation used in the united states im not so sure about you thoughgtgotcha anyone that disagrees with you as to how to help the poor is immoralits not about who disagrees with me this is a democratic republic it is up to the people to decide how this should be done through their government and elected officials that government decides what we as society chose to support or not support including how we treat the pooras you can tell from general polling a plurality of citizens in the united states support social safety nets even when republicans have tried to make cuts to these programs they have been met with strong widespread opposition to their proposed actionsgtit must be real easy to choose a candidate if the opposition is all immoral assholes to youif mitt romney is the candidatethen yes it is because he is a lying unprincipled immoral assholewe know that romney has the asshole vote mainly made up of people like yourself locked up however luckily for the rest of the country the nonasshole vote outnumbers the asshole vote gti dont submit my tax records when i apply for a jobno but a background and credit check are well within in the realm of possibility  both function to see where a persons disposition may lie with respect to money power and responsibility i look at it more like a credit check many places of employment will request that you allow them to run a credit check along with a background check so run a credit check on romney my guess is he has sterling credit great point and lets be honest i bet the vast majority of the people who are pounding this issue are people that have already decided to vote for obama anywayand we have the senate majority leader going around saying i heard a rumor the fuck this guys supposed to be one of the leaders of our country and hes pulling some middle school i heard a rumor shitif these are the people that we should all be looking to for leadership were all fucked hes from chicago the most corrupt city in the nation not corrupt my ass its hard to imagine a sillier argument i for one want to see whether he lied to the fec or the people of the united states  condone kndnverb   accept and allow behavior that is considered morally wrong or offensive to continue   approve or sanction something esp with reluctancemaybe the word youre looking for is condemn  it hit me on the drive home why did i put condone it hit me on the drive home why didnt you put condom because condoms are a lot like rattlesnakeskurise doesnt fuck with em  it hit me on the drive home why didnt you put on a condom youre condom hit me on the drive home because he threw it at you obviously  well that escalated quickly he hit me on the drive home why didnt you put on a condom the english language is easy to fuck up buddy dont worry about it even grammarspelling nazis have been theresee i forgot to capitalize the beginning of a sentencei feel lame godwins law again did you at least exchange insurance information but to be fair what kind of employer is going to ask you for years of past tax records the kind that employes  adults who for the most part pay their taxes in a lawful manner and keep at least a few years records or entrust their tax man to do so no one has to give their tax records to their employer that is ridiculous only reason we are asking romney for them is because he is setting tax policies and suspected of evading them would you post your tax returns for all of america to see if romney didnt pay his taxes dont you think that the irs would be up his ass romneys paying his taxes but hes probably been using some devious loopholes to legally avoid a greater share of it and the irs isnt interested enough  furthermore his returns could open him up to an sec investigation regarding his control of bain capital between   i think thats what hes afraid of at this pointi think there should be a special exception made only for presidents congressmen and judges the irs must make public all their tax records for the last  years prior to the year in which they are running and the candidate has no say in the matter  this would hopefully discourage a lot of potentially rotten eggs from running for office one where you manage trillions of dollars  many employers do full background checks those can include tax information you cant even get a fucking mortgage without  years of prior tax returns well instead of blaming romney blame the system for this job interview it is not required  why do taxes affect presidency if im looking for a new job ive never been asked to give them my taxes asking for tax returns is a perfectly reasonable request it may be a tad unfair but i hope obama runs a bunch of attack ads and repeatedly calls out romney  the worst part is he acts like he has given us something  he pretends like he has complied with what we want by releasing the  or  years he knew he would have to release ahead of time  show us the years you werent planning on releasinganyone can make their taxes look good for a year or two but  years would definitely tell a more precise story  fuck even the year he did release them he only paid  for christ sake since when are tax returns being released required to be presidenti am having trouble finding that part in the constitution thats their style though  they always play it that way offensive defense using your job interview analogy you wouldnt be asked to produce your tax returns in a job interview ive never been asked for tax records by any employer and nobody else ever has  where do you idiots come up with this shit i hate romney not going to vote for him but heres why his position is defensible there is no constitutional requirement to release tax returns  there is a constitutional requirement to be a natural born citizen fuck income taxes  realconservatives think its stupid to tax people for earning an income  we want people working right  we want people earning an income right  we dont want them living off welfare right  when you tax something you get less of it  taxing incomes is stupid  so frankly i dont give a shit if romney paid a cent in income taxes  if he figured out a way to avoid them good for him hiring manager here  i have never and would never hire a person who refused to provide more than their last year of job experience  the only exception would be if i was hiring a kid right out of school who had no previous experience which case it would be all about the interview and references actually with the background checks they do now they check a lot of your financial information as well  they want to make sure you arent a cheating thieving nogood moneyhogging so and so   and its not at all different from how the dems reacted when the republicans demanded obamas birth certificate try not to drown yourself in accusations of victimization to be fair some repubs have called him out on it too are tax records a requirement to be president not sure i ever read that in the constitutionthough i disagreed with the birthers over the issue natural born is a prerequisite to the presidency in the constitution the nutjobs at least had something that they thought was an issue that romney will not release his returns has nothing to do with his qualifications to be president except in the minds of suspicious democrats and liberals that really doesnt count for much since those folks dont consider him qualified anyway this whole tax return bullshit is an attempt to create controversey and keep romney on the defensive and in the news to distract the sheeple from the shit job obama and the democrats have done to turn this country around its about transparency and honesty if he cant be honest about his tax records how can you expect him to be honest about everything elsewhy is romney on the defensive why doesnt he just release his tax records hes rich as fuck he has tons of bank accounts over seas the american people know he is nothing like them and is a rich fat cat why doesnt he release this information given that we already know he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth how exactly does this distract us hes being secretive and almost dishonest by not producing what the american people want prove that he pays his taxes prove that he takes advantage of tax havens prove that he takes advantage of loop holes that average americans cant so essentially youre saying prove to us what we already know or suspect which means absolutely nothing like i said before its a nonissue so if he shows his returns and their suspicions are confirmed libs will say see we told you that rich sonofabitch has been taking advantage of tax loopholes like other fatcat politicians like obama pelosi and others and using shelters and offshore accounts to legally hide his money how dare he use the gaping holes in the tax code put there by senate democrats to decrease his taxable incomethen if there is nothing untoward or remarkable about his returns the libs will say well we dont like his face just lookit his goddamn faceand his hair is that a thousand dollar haircut jebus he must have gone to the same stylist as john kerry or john edwardsits a bullshit distraction that few people care about thats because the republican party is still manipulating the records to show that he had actually paid his taxes give them a little longer and those documents will come forth albeit not entirely truthful why the hell do his tax records matter at allwhile i dont support the republicans their argument does make sense  they thought that obama wasnt a citizen which is obviously stupid and wanted to see proof that he was  they kept asking for it again and again because they didnt feel convinced that it was authenticwhat is the argument here about romney  you just want to laugh at how much money he made oris the accusation tax evasion or something  if so what would tax records prove  hes evading the irs his opponent are claiming that hes evading taxes outsourcing etc having him show his tax returns would prove or disprove those claimsbasically there is a cookie missing from the cookie jar and crumbs on romneys face were asking him to show us his hands he has shown us his right hand and asked us to trust him that there isnt a cookie in his left but that doesnt invalidate him as a presidential candidate  the opposition could ask for naked photos of him if they wanted that doesnt mean that he has to provide them blatantly lying to the public people doesnt make him an invalid candidate for the most powerful position in the worldgranted i realized there is so much the public doesnt know that the president does but if hes already lying about something like this how far will that nutjob go once hes in the hot seat and his facebook passwords if this were an actual job interview he wouldnt get to the drug test point because he would be disqualified for lying about his past experience and qualifications when did romney lie about his past experience and qualifications everything he said about his missionary work and i mean everything was made up he talked about spending his time in france shitting in a bucket bathing with a hose and buying food day to day for lack of a fridge his fellow mormon missionaries from the time came out to the british paper the telegraph because they were so disturbed by the degree to which he lied he spent most of his year there in a multimillion dollar mansion with a hired cook look it up on google shits crazy ill be damned tilgtin his remarks this week mr romney said of his french lodgings i dont recall any of them having a refrigerator we shopped before every meal mr anderson said that as well as a refrigerator the mansion had a spanish chef called pardo and a house boy who prepared lunch and supper five days a week gt they were so disturbed by the degree to which he lied he spent most of his year there in a multimillion dollar mansion with a hired cook look it up on google shits crazyi want to be able to find this post again this country has gone half nuts the other half mostly numb  i think op is talking about bain capital around  its sketchy at best hey now its not like hes applying for welfare but he has said that he was unemployed retroactively retiring etc and id say a presidential campaign counts as actively seeking employment i wouldnt be surprised if he could find a loophole to get welfare just to spite the system and medical records too  i demand to see an invasive ultrasound on romney  what is mitt hiding i demand a suppository well all right if you need one but we were talking about mitt transanally by guess is a big stick up his ashey hey kids who wants to see some more itchy and scratchy  lol i demand to confirm that there is no lizard in his head botany bay  botany bay oh no botany bay um i think candidates give their full medical records  its kinda important when you run for head of a state you shouldve seen how difficult it was to get john mccains medical records on his latestage melanoma its a job interview for all of america if you want to become president you cant be hiding stuff and check his degrees it cant hurt im gonna need his facebook password as well he doesnt even drinkmisdirection is the key dont pay attention to facts policy failures and broken campaign promises  keep looking in the other direction that is the plan and it seems to be workingthis is the same nonsense as the birthers  he already released the tax documents they have been scrutinized and found boring  what is funny is that you are all acting like the birthers by not doing the minimum research and washing your hands of this misdirection rhetoric tacticplease do not act like the birthers the amount of retarded will ultimately break reddit if we keep circlejerking this shit instead of paying attention to the real issues concerning policy can we have his facebook password too for this job he should have to be probed  then how was obamas application successful romney is an even worse presidential candidate than sarah palin was as a vp and that says a lot because palin is dumber than my toenail clippings    i cant remember a us presidential candidate more unsuited for the office than romney  i simply can not and a pyschiatric review which we all know hed probably fail i think youre confusing him with bush yup  just like bush we shouldve drug tested that bastard too p did we ask w for his tax return as well i wonder how much he wrote off for halliburton  sadly hell probably win willard is lds no alcohol tobacco or anything harderobama claim to have routinely smoked weed and used coke  clearly drinksbush   likely used coke and or weed had a duiclinton clearly used week and is alleged to have used cokedo you see anything in common isnt obama reapplying for the same job  lets drug test him as well  it might be interesting as i have information from a very reliable source that barack obama does a line every day  i support drug testing mitt romney best comment on reddit i demand he has a psych evaluation too one should not equate the other obama probably had a lot of thc in his system if its for a job i also want his facebook and twitter passwords you people are so gullible yes if i went into an interview and told the person to hire me because the other person trying for the job is a bad person who did something sometime to someone lets just say it would be a short interview yet year after year the campaign ads robocalls debates interviews all contact with the candidates revolve around negative ads against the other candidates drives me nuts  its a job interview so candidates should provide college transcripts alsooh wait if a potential employer were to ask for even one years tax return from me i would walk right out of there on principal alone hes probably addicted to oxycontin did they drug test mr choomer inchief didnt joseph smith promote hookers and cocaine i want his sanity tested even if he got caught hed probably hire somebody to do the time for him lets test obamatoo since he brags about it and says drugs are bad now for extra leftard hypocrisy     editla la la  i cant hear you whine the obamaphiles via the downvotes i logged injust to upvote you how about seeing obamas college transcripts  what is he hiding well lets hope romney doesnt pull and obama and release and obvious fake photoshop composite of his tax returns and his facebook password mitt romney herejust popped in to tell you all that the reason i dont want to release my tax returns is because the mormon church will find out i havent been tithing the amount i should be also i dont want my kids to find out how much im worth so back off will ya  and god bless america if proven obama born us would ineligible if we find discrepancies romneys tax records we learn hes scumbag and i think theres evidence prove that hawaii certified his birth when he was a presidential candidate the right could have come up with irrefutable evidence that his birth certificate was false and it would not have mattered because the full faith and credit clause bounds every state in the union to respect the legitimacy of obamas birth certificate no state has the authority to challenge hawaii  im sure this isnt what i should be taking away from this but god damn hawaii freaking rules haha well it does apply to every single state  stop with your logic lawgic clich hawaii didnt really do anything some office clerk just grabbed a copy of his birth certificate made a copy certified it and gave it to the requesting party business as usual gtit would not have mattered because the full faith and credit clause bounds every state in the union to respect the legitimacy of obamas birth certificateno way is this true i can imagine there being a loophole of some kind if he wasnt responsible for the deception but that seems a little strange for that to be the case us constitution article iv section gtfull faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts records and judicial proceedings of every other state and the congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts records and proceedings shall be proved and the effect thereofthe provision is meant to have uniformity amongst the states if you are a convicted killer in one state than you are in all  states if you are married in one state then you are married in all this is where doma came from etc etc i never understood something about the birthers  dont you have to provide your birth certificate when filling out the papers for president or sometime before he actually starts running  i mean i had to get my birth certificate when i moved into my local school district  years ago to attend middle school there lol yeah you have to have it to get a drivers license too god himself could say he was born in hawaii and they would probably still believe he was born in kenya hawaii is a state show me the proof how would that apply to the federal district of columbiawhat if it was fake he should then be impeachedthats like a company drug testing for a job the results are delayed so you start work then they come back as failed but they say oh well youre already working doesnt matter how much more against logic can you go the right should have just made a fake one and put it on fox news actually there is evidence that the birth certificate provided by obama is a fake add to that the question of his two social security numbers it just goes to prove that no matter how much proof is provided those in power will do whatever they want and theres nothing we can do about it citation neededdrudge report or fox do not qualify the whole birth certificate thing was so fucking stupid to begin with for the simple reason that the most powerful man in the government could get a  passable fake government document if he wantedthat aside here is one interesting tidbiti dont think the released bc is a fake one but i did notice something interesting when i opened the officially released birth certificate in adobe illustrator it has been a few months since i looked at it but this is what i remember from iteverything is in layers everything that was written in pen on the birth certificate is on its own separate layer that makes no sense whatsoever you would think that the document would be a scannedin copy of a birth certificate but when you turn the extra layers off it leaves a birth certificate that has a bunch of whitedout sections it looks liked they redacted a lot of stuff and then went back in and added new info in digitally here is a link to the first article on itthat popped up after a google searchnow do i consider this evidence of tampering no why doesnt this seem like tampering to me because if the whitehouse was going to fake a government document they could definitely do better than this i mean if a collegeage graphic designer jerkoff like me could find those issues within  seconds of opening a file then our government isnt as good as secrets as we think they are i mean what they did is the equivalent of changing something on a paper form by writing the new info on a slip of paper and gluing it to the original formso it seems to me like there must be an innocent reason for uploading a whacky bc but i have no idea what the reasoning behind it was i would appreciate knowing the real answer if any other redditors know and feel like sharing its just too obviously tampered with to actually have been tampered with you know what i meanedited to correct speeling some scanners and associated software have text recognition when something isnt clearly typed on white paper if you forget to turn the text recognition off it will reproduce the document with a bunch of weird layers this is the most likely explanation ive heard for the phenomenon youve describedi spend a lot of time fact checking political emails because my dad is too lazy to check snopes so i end up knowing a lot of this worthless crap glad to find a second opportunity to use this tidbit on birth certificate being fakeabc news ny daily news ap social security number questionssnopes western center for journalism white house press conference where white house rep avoided the question entirely on obamas ss number then walked offstage this shit isnt that hard to find  i could link you hundreds of different sites on these two issues alone  snopes flat out says false read your own shit fool fuck arpaio whether you like the messenger or not facts are facts and he has proven via facts that the released birth certificate is fake i just cant understand why people continually deny facts when they dont like them really some asshole racist sheriff proved that its fake the headline is obamas birth certificate maybe forged sheriff arpaio saysdo you know what a fucking fact is how one is determined good lord you must be a hit at parties did you read what i wrote at all though it doesnt matter if obama released a forged birth certificateits not forgedbecause hawaii has already saidthat he was born there article iv section  us constitutiongtfull faith and credit ought to be given in each state to the public acts records and judicial proceedings of every other state and the legislature shall by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts records and proceedings shall be proved and the effect which judgments obtained in one state shall have in anotherno other state has the authority to challenge the legitimacy of obamas birth certificate the constitution requires every other state to give full faith and credit to obamas birth certificate i thought you people were all about upholding and defending the constitution read my response to another poster i can call today and have one created even if i want born there it isnt that hard  do it and upload it you will be famous gt actually there is no real evidence that the birth certificate provided by obama is a fakeftfy oo no real evidence lol they provided a shitload of real fucking evidence what do you fucking want a little angel to fly down from heaven and say yes its fake  while i havent read up recently nothing i read about presented as evidence earlier this year was even remotely credible at some point you call shitfest what is the funny part is there was one presidential candidate who wasnt born in the us and his name was john mccain i didnt see calls for mccains birth certificate i wonder what the difference was yes i know about him being born on or near an air force base blah blah blah im making a rhetorical point dude white skin  his anglosaxon heritage herman cain must hate black people tooit wasnt about race for most for some you bet your ass it was but the majority of birthers just hated obama for being a socialist commie and thought this was a way to get rid of him the rightwing media took advantage of an uneducated group of people some of which were racist but many of which were not and convinced them that obama was some sort of manchurian candidate they used the fact that he spent an extended period of time growing up in indonesia they used the fact that his father was kenyan and numerous people erroneously claiming that they were there when he was born in kenya they used the fact that he didnt release college transcripts as proof that he was being groomed to be president by george soros or whoever the leftwing boogeyman of the day is for them from a young ageeven when hawaii said he was eligible it wasnt enough the rightwing media convinced people that this was all part of the cover up they convinced them that news clippings of his birth were doctored and physical copies of that newspaper didnt exist this frustrates me quite a bit im mixed but because my mother is very light skinned white woman with swedish blood and my father is a very light skinned black person i look like a white person with a decent tan ive been called a racist by people because i disagree with many of obamas policies this annoys the heck out of me ive had somebody tell me i just want to keep blacks on the plantation despite the fact that i am just as black as our president people are bound to disagree with any politician do you really think that if obama were white all of the people that voted for mccain would suddenly support obama of course not people disagree with him on policy people also like to abuse the system much like the republicans did with clinton during the lewinski days they thought they had an easy way to get rid of president clinton and they did everything they could to accomplish that goal this is the same thing that happened with obama the rightwing media convinced a lot of gullible voters that obama was ineligible and the easiest way to stop him from destroying america was to prove that he was never eligible to be president in the first placetldr claiming the only reason that people claimed obama wasnt born in america was based on racism is being blatantly ignorant or dishonest there were multiple other factors that made him quite a bit different from any other presidential candidate muslim name kenyan father lived in se asia for years as a child some of the hatred was based on race but much of it was based on politics the same politics that made republicans hate john kerry the same politics that made republicans impeach president clinton calling people a racist with very little basis behind the claim does nothing more than divide people take it from someone who is equally as black as our president being wrongfully called a racist is one of the most offensive claims you can make it hurts as much as being called a nigger ive been called both in my time they are equally as painful in my opinion  longest tldr ever    ive done longer  i dont think you get what tldr means i think youre wrong but thats only my opinion we can say its based on politics but when those politics are rooted in racism which they clearly are well thats still racism i dont think its just his skin color  its his overall ethnicity and background  herman cain is an american black man and also a successful ceo  aside from his skin color he fits into the classic gop mold quite wellobama is kenyan with a muslim name and was an urban community organizer  he embodies almost everything that scares the shit out of gop diehards  i cant be sure which part of himskin name background ethnicitybothered them the most  but i became convinced there was prejudice involved when all you heard for  months was barack hussein obama every time republicans said his name  and then theyd play fucking coy like what  its just his middle name is it not  i was never conservative but that was the moment i realized the gop panders to the lowest stupidest class of americans and id never be able to side with themanyway i dont know if its racism or some other form of ignorant prejudice but i paint it all with the same brush your tldr needs a tldr  gt just hated obama for being a socialist commie and thought this was a way to get rid of himwhy do americans keep pawning people off to us hes a bourgeois capitalist through and through as perfect an example of everything wrong with capitalism as any gop candidatethey should wish he was a socialist or a communist because shock horror things might actually improve for the vast majority of people  i was just quoting the rhetoric from the right by no means do i believe that socialist commie describes president obama americans spent the last  years believing that communism was evil and that socialism is just the little brother of communism the gop makes crap up about obama because the truth isnt as scary as they need it to be they need to convince voters that obama is destroying america on purpose mind you and will rebuild us as a muslim nation do you hear yourself you are rationalizing the existence of the proof against obama being an american citizen it is naive to think that something isnt true when there is evidence to prove otherwise the hawiian birth certificate he presented to the nation is a digitally created electronic document which has different layers of detail  the inconsistencies of print and detail throughout the document give evidence that the document was fabricated especially when compared to eleanor nordykes  hawiian birth certificate keep in mind that was only an electronic copy not an original vault copy of the long form birth certificate which would be required in a court of law then there is also the fact that lucas smith discovered obamas original birth certificate in mombasa kenya in  i remember reading the kenyans telling lucas how happy they were to have a kenyen as americas president thinking obama was born in america is like thinking smoking cigarettes is ok theres all these reasons why you shouldnt but you still do   this is my new official comeback to anything the difference was there was a special senate resolution passed declaring mccain a natural born citizen so no one ever questioned the fact he was born in the panama canal zone a special senate resolution cosponsored by barack obama when they became running opponentsedit added a co shit i didnt know thisobama was only a cosponsor but that is really upstanding of him kinda puts the whole birther scandal in a new light doesnt it i had known the bush team had used mccains foreign birth against him in the primaries in  i think but i had not realized the dems stepped up and did this really nice thing it is pretty amazing that the republican party couldnt step up and make a statement recognizing senator obamas legitimacy they didnt need to obama was born in hawaii and hawaii was a state when he was born nonissue mccain was born on a military base which are considered us territory but a circle jerk argument could ensue that its not really us territory hence the senate resolution which effectively declares the circumstances of mccains birth a nonissue as well  i disagree it isnt amazing at all which is absolutely heartbreaking in and of itself  im sure he would have expected the favor returned if needed  you should post that to til thanks make it so then someone else should post it again tomorrow am i doing this right and my home states claire mccaskill was the sponsor the more i learn about her the more i like her i just wish i was still in missouri to vote for her reelection this year funny most of the sponsors were dems  probably wouldnt see any republicans doing that for obama only a cosponsor  yes the bill has a sponsor senator clair mccaskill and  cosponsors including thensenator obamaedit what was unclear or improper with my wording i dont see it thanks for posting this  i hadnt heard of it before   obama was a senator in to clarify in  the senate passed a law stating that people born in the panama canal zone to be naturalized american citizens the resolution referred to here is as meaningless as those proclaiming national soup day how do we know he was born in the canal zone  maybe his mother was traveling right outside it for any number of reasons and had the birth filed in the zone so he could run for president one day we only know what the records tell us from that we must assume fact by your logic one could say obama was born in japan the hawaiian bc is a lie with equal validity none yes thank you  that was my point you dont suppose that was satire honestly with rpolitics the way it is there was no way for me to know coincidentally my first name is jeff and my last name is mo that is quite a coincidenceme too not quite that many letters in my last name but still pretty close just a thought isnt whether or not youre a natural born citizen a thing determined the moment youre born  isnt that what natural born as opposed to naturalized means  american at birth  and mccain wasnt on the day he was born he wasnt a natural born citizen doesnt that make him ineligible  youd think scalia at a minimum would have a hard time arguing against the textual reality  the entire reason for that resolution was because people were questioning mccains eligibility  a similar resolution was passed for obama after people started claiming that he didnt meet the natural born citizen clause   the other funny part is george romney mitts father was born in mexico  no one disputes this and he was fine to run in    why is that funnyquestions were occasionally asked about romneys eligibility to run for president owing to his birth in mexico given the ambiguity in the united states constitution over the phrase naturalborn citizen romney departed the race before the matter could be more definitively resolved did he ever become a lawful us citizen he was a natural born citizen his parents were both american citizens  being born in the states isnt the only way to be a natural born citizen   romneys father ran too born in mexico anyone can run it doesnt mean they can become elected anyone can run and we still didnt manage to get joseph kony in come on reddit yekrats said that there was one candidate mccain i was simply offering another its because hes a maverick duh  doesnt matter where he was born he became a natural born us citizen when he was born to american parents  thats all the constitution requires asside from being  and living here for x years yeah just like andrew jackson except the part where he was born to american parents wait wait wait so being stationed in south korea and if my wife pops a baby he shouldnt be considered a legitimate american your idea on rhetorical points is bad no i think both candidates last presidential cycle were natural born citizens there were actually birthers requesting to see his birth certificate but they were a minority the fact that mccain was not born in one of the  states doesnt matter he was born in us territory  for that matter even if he was born outside the canal zone his parents were american citizens and thus he was too  and if i remember correctly this whole argument was shut down when barry goldwater who was born in the arizona territory ran for office  also obama is a first generation american  now im not saying i agree with asking for his birth certificate but i can see why some people wanted itedit and i would say the same thing if anyone was asked to show their bc to run for office technically obama never even needed to be born in america to be an american citizen his mother was an american citizen and as long as she had lived in america  years prior to his birth obama wouldve acquired an american birth certificate so its like whats the big fucking deali just realized this has nothing to do with mccainim sorry but it applies to him and military children wasnt he born on a us base in panama which is technically us soil besides having an american parent is all that matters which would also apply to bama mccain was born offbase to american parents ah but doesnt the constitution simply require being born to an american parent the difference is that mccain is a republican and the democrats unfortunately dont pull the same scumbag character assassinations that the gop does in pretty much every major election  the dems are far from perfect but no party throws around as much hate accusations and outright lies as the republicans   actually obama was a cosponsor on the senate bill that recognized mccains status as a natural born citizen that just goes to show that the dems are not like the scumbag republicans the sponsor as well as  out of the  cosponsors were dems  the opposite would almost never happen in our current political climate    and why did they do it i mean i think only the republicans in the  primary season contested mccains eligibility do you think they thought by doing this the birther nonsense would go away i dont get it there are issues with both parties of course but when it comes right down to it i just dont see the dems being the complete and utter scum that most republican politicians seem to be  the dems are way too willing to walk across the aisle to work with the other side and maybe get something accomplished  the gop is typically not nearly as open to doing the same  in fact before the last presidential election mccain was one of the few republicans that was willing to sometimes work with the other side  of course all that changed after that election and mccain proved to be as big of a dbag as every other wingnuteven after obama cosponsored that bill you posted even that didnt stop mccain and more specifically his vp choice from questioning obamas birth  thats the type of snakes these people are   youre right about this but have you seen some of the attack ads the dems have been running about romney lately theyre absolutely destroying this guy and i love it thing is their attacks are all legitimate and factual as far as i know at least now the republicans are swinging wildly to save themselves hence the taking obamas you didnt build that quote massively out of context not that they wouldnt have done that even if the dems were being their usual selves and being too passive  thats typically the difference  the dems arent angels but when they attack their opponent its more likely that they will do it with more factsbased ads than the outright nonsense that the gop is famous for  the gop will characterassassinate a decorated war hero with madeup stories having the gall to question his military service  the dems will question a challengers tax policies and how they are aimed at only helping the ultra wealthy  there is quite a massive difference between the two approaches the dems are unfortunately way too passive like you mention  i am glad that so far in this election that has not been the case   yeah now if only obama and his peeps would take this approach to everything and actually be a true progressive sadly hes an extremely conservative democrat judging by his actions or inaction in regards to a lot of his policy decisions  obama is a pragmatists  without a supporting base in congress to get his programs through what good is it for him to be more progressive  i love how people think the presidential race is supposedly the most important race but then forget about the fact that we do not live in a dictatorship and the president needs support in congress to get things done  there was a huge number of folks supporting him  years ago but those same people stayed home in droves when it came to midcycle elections and with that the gop gained much more power  i agree with you that i would like to see him be more progressive but with the mood of the country as it is now its just not going to change unless more progressives go vote  in fact there are rumblings that the gop might actually gain more seats in congress in this election  that would weaken obama even more assuming he even wins reelection  youre kidding right how can you make such a sweeping statement joe biden plagiarized his damn law reviewand if the dems are such moral saints why not take the high road and have obama release his questionable grades from college and law school  grades really  neom fair and balanced with grilling questionsif you want to be president of the us why did you fail your rd grade spelling testthe questions you want to hear the answers to this thursday at  following the oriley report only on fox news did i talk about his rd grade spelling test i dont think i did  im not sure about your first point but your second about obama not releasing his transcriptsthat has nothing to do with being a good person  it has nothing to do with throwing around hate and accusations  hence the downvotes you received   actually if he committed any crimes due to how he filed he would also be ineligible  but until they are looked at more closely no one will know what he has done   its unlikely he did anything illegal his accountants are too sharp for that more likely he took advantage of some creative bookkeeping and loopholes that would make him very distasteful unelectable to the general electorate when you get into his level of tax and accounting tricks youve gone beyond the realm of legal and illegal  its all quasilegal beyond the scope of how the the law and the irs are designed to handle things and the rich have far better lawyers and accountants than the government doeswhen you have tens of millions of dollars in a k thats supposedly capped at  in additions a year you know somethings wrong  but romney probably has an opinion in a desk somewhere by some lawyer telling him how its all perfectly legal  or at least not prosecutablebut as others have said its not just the legality  im not sure when republicans got the idea that its fine and dandy to avoid paying any and all taxes through every trick in the book  swiss and cayman island bank accounts are viewed terribly for a reason no matter how legal they are  its why obama was running ads about them there is nothing wrong with his k his part of the business was held under the umbrella of his k therefore his income for his part of the business went directly into that account it happened to be a very successful business that earned him millions of dollars it has little to do with the individual max contribution of  that you are referring to there is nothing illegal about it anyone can do it although its not recommended for most i am sure it is unlikely however unlikely or not the american public has the right to know for sure  if only there were an organization that had access to tax records and can perform investigations on suspect tax fillings in a nonbias nonpartisan way within the government  if only that organization could decide for and vote for every american  he is hiding something we deserve to know what  doesnt have to be illegal to be bad gt doesnt have to be illegal to be badno it doesnt if you want to see his taxes because he might be using tax loopholes thats legitimate whats not a legitimate argument is to say he might have done something illegal that is just fear baiting  i didnt say he did something illegal i am simply saying that politicians and the rich have bought off government officials before and taking their word for it is naive  it is not fear baiting to take into consideration that corruption runs deep and the only way to know for sure is to have it looked at by the public  this is why we have a press its also what his tax records might say about his relationship with bain i think youre right about his personal taxes being legal but very bad pr for  of americans but the smoking gun is what he portrayed to the sec he believes that the earth is only  years old and is polling at around  regardless of thisdo you think these people are going to care about tax discrepencies there was a nice little tax amnesty a few years back for people who had stashed money in foreign countries to avoid taxes  ill lay odds that he took advantage of this and if he took advantage of the tax evasion amnesty option in   that doesnt change the fact that he committed a felony it just means that he wont get punished for it  while it wouldnt inherently invalidate him as a candidate it would likely be bad enough pr to kill his campaign  one nonfinancial crime his tax reports could reveal is voter fraud in  he registered to vote in massachusetts and declared his primary residence as his sons unfinished basement he voted in the  special election for scott brown at the time he owned houses in maryland and california if he paid taxes in maryland rather than massachusetts taking advantage of the lower rate hes guilty of fraudulent registration  the irs looked at them  the irs is not the american public  the irs does not cast every americans vote or make up every americans mind  it is pretty simple if you want to keep something like this private dont run for the highest public office what would his tax records prove exactly  why would anyone base their decision on a candidates tax records i dont know what it could prove  until we see them we wont know  that is kinda the point  whatever he is hiding could speak volumes  clearly he thinks it does as he would rather get the bad press for hiding them romney doesnt have to show you shit and you dont have to vote for him thats how elections work it doesnt matter what office hes running for hes not obligated to show you uh yeah he is obligated  what the hell kind of logic is that if you run for a public office your life becomes public if you want privacy then dont run for public office  part of making an informed decisions is having all available information  in a democracy that is pretty important no he wouldnt a criminal record does not preclude one from holding the office of president moreover do you honestly think romney would fuck with the irs they probably take a good loong look at his returns every year because so much is at stake for them millions and millions of dollars in taxes  good point i guess you are right we can have felons as presidents  cant own a gun if you are a felon but can command nuclear weaponsmakes perfect sense  however would america elect a felon likely noti do not however believe he cheated i believe he took advantage of every single loophole available to the  and paid next to nothing which he knows would tank his campaign and rightfully so as that is what a big chunk of our current problem is wealth inequality and broken tax systemas for the irs they fuck up all the time and it wouldnt be the first time an ultrawealth guy pulled a fast one on them  his and may rich peoples taxes are extremely complicated which they can use to their advantage and have im totally on board with all of your comments gtwould america elect a feloni think not also but if you asked me in  if wed elect a black man id have said no i have both faith in and fear of our citizens i think felons can own guns felons can be presidentit all depends on the felon and the crime white collar felony why cant you own a gun exactlygti believe he took advantage of every single loophole available to the definitely and we all should they are there to be used im in law school and one of my biggest surprises has been learning how active courts like bankruptcy courts encourage people to maximize their exemptions even permittingencouraging selling of property to fund exempt retirement accounts for examplethe loopholes i dont like the term it implies it wasnt a planned part of the legislation when it usually is gun show loophole for instance in most states refers to the ability of private citizens to buy and sell from and to other private citizens at gun shows the thing is they can do it outside of gun shows as well dealers in almost every state are bound by the same rules in or out of the show are probably the center of why he does not want to release presuming he isnt refusing just for the publicity which may very well be the reason americans will see how he exempted millions of dollars which will appear to be really shitty behavior on his part merely because of the amounts he donated something like  million to charity or something last year regardless we are all still bound by the amt which we should all be screaming at our reps to relegislate initially designed to effect the wealthy it is not tied to inflation and seldom increased so it effects a lot of us cg and qualifying dividends have been exempted recently which means the tax has less of the desired effect it was designed for gtas for the irs they fuck up all the timeaint that the truth actually the irs typically focuses its audit efforts on middleclass taxpayers because they know those in the upperclass have the resources to fund costly and timeconsuming litigation efforts against the irs  its more efficient and effective for the irs to turn the other way when the ultrarich submit questionable tax returns and instead go after those who cannot afford to hire lawyers to defend against irs judgments just one more way the system has failed can you prove this id be very interested in learning more about it while a felony may preclude one from voting for an office depending on the state it does not preclude one from running for the office of president you think that msnbc is going to uncover something that the irs missed maybe the irs misses a lot  but i doubt he has done anything illegal he has simply paid a paltry tax  rate compared to the middle class and the republican party cant have that little nugget broadcasted to the working class they are trying to win over that working class however has every right to that information  theres no way they missed anything on his tax return they certainly give politicians tax returns a more thorough look over than the average person the irs actually has different qualifications for whose tax returns they randomly audit each year  mitts financial and political position would have triggered an extra checki think your second point is more compelling the idea that he wouldnt be qualified to run is a weaker argument i think its heading towards an equivalency with the nonsensical idea that we would need to see obamas birth certificate the irs most likely did not miss anything but you know what if he wants to run for a public office the public has the right to see what the agency they are paying for with their tax dollars didobamas birth certificate was a rightwing manufactured theatrical performance a temper tantrum because they lost the presidency a candidates taxes is a legitimate question directly related to a huge issue of our times how much lower of a percentage of taxes did the rich man pay than the working class he is trying to pander to and it would also shed light on when he actually stopped working for bain which is likely what he wants so desperately to hide if he had nothing to hide he could bitch slap the hell of the left and come out looking like a champ  that he hasnt should alone make everyone raise an eyebrow   wait i agreejust saying you should stick to that argument instead of the idea that we may find that he did something illegal  like your original comment i was not trying to argue that he did something illegal  i was simply saying there is no way to know that for sure unless his releases his tax returns like every candidate has since his own father   call me crazy but i want as much information as we can get about the guy who is a potential leader of the free world it wouldnt make him ineligible it might make him unelectable though we are still spreading this false informationgt if it could have been proven that obama was not born in the us he would have been ineligiblehe was born to a us citizen and so was a naturalborn citizen and met that requirement to be president this is an oversimplification the constitution never defines the term naturalborn citizen and there have been a number of different interpretations of it over the years  some constitutional scholars claim that it means born on us soil or us jurisdiction others dont  the supreme court has never explicitly ruled on the matter congress clarified this and many other things otherwise every fucking person in the country would have been ineligible to be presidentboom which was promptly repealed by the united states naturalization act  of  and is thus no longer applicable  boomand that in turn was repealed and superseded by something else which also does not define naturalborn citizen   i realize that there may be shades of gray on this do you really think that someone being born in puerto rico on vacation to two jordanian parents has more of a claim on natural born citizen than someone who was born to a us citizen who along with that parent lived in the us most of their lives i think when push comes to shove it would have been understood as natural born from a legal standpoint it doesnt matter a whit what you or i think constitutes american enough to be president it depends on the interpretation and political leanings of the hypothetical court that makes that determination   well i mean i dont think that an obvious foreign citizen say vladimir putin could be our president i dont know what mechanism stands in his way though would he have to win and then have a supreme court case against him i learned this in highschool yet there are senators without this much knowledge i learned from montereyo that is not exactly the case gtif it could have been provennotice hypothetical phrasing  it still was irrelevant lets assume falsely and just for the sake of argument that pres obama was born outside of the us he is still a natural born citizen having been born to a us citizen add to this that hawaii recognized that he was born in the us and there is official and circumstantial evidence that he was and the whole topic is pointless x only reason some people want to see the birth certificate is because they are goddamned racists  appropriate username this is exactly what drove me crazy his mother is a us citizen people were screaming how he cant be the president because he wasnt born in the country which he was but beside the point if his mother is a us citizen that makes him a us citizen he could have been born on the moon and it wouldnt matter gt he could have been born on the moon that would have been cool though and it is sorta a us property still i just said fuck yeah america and fist pumped alone in my living room it was completely involuntary oh god whats happening to me  you love big brother you really do the issue is whether he is a naturalborn citizen this is not explicitly defined in the constitution and there are arguments that it means only on us soil jus soli and that it means citizen at birth either jus soli or jus sanguinis the supreme court has never ruled definitely on this issue  i do tend to agree with the interpretation that it simply means citizen at birth meaning obama would be eligible whether he was born in hawaii or kenya or mars by virtue of jus sanguinis  incorrectat the time he was born us law did not confer citizenship to someone born of one american parent off us soil i believe it only applied to american mothers and not fathers but im not positive who had not lived in the us for a certain period of time after turning  obamas mother was not old enough to pass on blood citizenship at that time arent these people grandfathered in when a law like this is passed no as theyre citizens of somewhere else and the point of this law was to stop the children and grandchildren of expats who have never lived in the us from being citizens dont you have to be born to parents who are both us citizens i agree the argument is ridiculous but i still dont fully understand the actual details of the requirements  here is the irs page on itthe us citizen parent had to live in us for some number of years like almost all people who live in the us do and obamas mother did then look it up i did which is why i suggested that was the case and by requirements i meant all the things you have to pass in order to be potus the requirement that tricks me is the  year one because it apparently doesnt have to be consecutive which is what i had always thought  it is a matter of some contention what naturalborn means but it is possible to be a us citizen at birth with  american parent and being born in another country i doubt wed see someone like that running for president as theyd be a dual citizen and that has a political stigma attached to it  do you really want to see ahnuld as president its a question that hasnt been tested in court there are a number of different interpretations of what the natural born clause actually means you are probably right but its ambiguous and by no means decided law at this point as it has yet to be taken up in the courtsi think the idea among those seriously pursuing it was to challenge that definition in court if he was unable to produce a birth certificate  can you give us a link of them saying this preferably with a statement after the certification of birth was released in  this is not true  american law at the time required that the american parent passing the citizenship on have lived in the us for  years after their th birthday and obamas mother only had  years because she was  not because she lived overseas  so if obama was born on mars or whatever he wouldnt have been a natural born citizen but of course he was born in honolulu so this is just an interesting factual note  gt is still a natural born citizen having been born to a us citizenthis is contested  the constitution never defined naturalborn citizen and there have been a number of different interpretations of the phrase over the years eh but from what i have seen the leaning in toward accepted this group although it is interesting that in this wikithey seem to think there was a significantly harder case against mccain they also cite a lot of cases of foreign born to us citizens running for president yeah but it could also be that he is a uk citizen due to his father and let me tell you that the founders put the natural born citizen language in the writing they explicitly did not want british citizens to ever be commander in chief of the secessionist territories  he would have had to have declared uk citizenship as an adult which he didnt and since he chose to stay in the us he maintained his us citizenship at the expense of others although some countries would have allowed him to maintain dualcitizenship however your theory is add as every single one of the founding fathers were british citizens before the revolution i dont think any of them were frenchborn or other europeanborn but i could be in error on this however if they were citizens of the colonies they were british citizens but they very formally seceded in writing what i would like to say is that i am curious as to the actual definition of natural born citizen since you can run for congress as a regular citizen i suppose yeah i think it is considered not very clear no the constitution made an exception for people living in the us at the start of the nation as there would be no natural born us citizens i agree with your statement but do not understand your first sentence no what are you arguing  gt and let me tell you that the founders put the natural born citizen language in the writing they explicitly did not want british citizens to ever be commander in chief of the secessionist territoriesgt no except thats not true you have to be born inside of the us or on a us army base to be natural born and have  parents that are us citizens to be consider natural born as opposed to naturalized also saying that its unfair to ask when his own book that he wrote and signed off on and had reedited every  years and resigned off on claimed he was born in kenya his own book he wrote so its absolutely a fair question because either he is a liar or he is a fraud and faked his birth certificate those are the only two outcomes that are possiblebut go ahead and keep on the socialist liberal bandwagon entitlements for everyone we can all just lie and blame people who are dead its not our fault anymore blame everyone else point your fingers you are no longer responsible its them if they are you then just point back yay socialism please use a commonly accepted source and point me to where i can read clearly and simply that you are correct about natural born citizen wikipediadoes not think it is clear cut as you do and they pretty much agree with what i have heardalso how many officials in hawaii and courts in other stateshave to say he was born in the us for you to give up the stupid breitbart shit even if he was born outside the us he is still eligible for the presidency because one of his parents was an american citizenjus sanguini citizenship for the most part yes though the constitution is not clear on what is meant by natural born citizen to american citizen parents would certainly count nor is it clear on a wellregulated militia correct one must look to external context to determine original intent same holds for natural born citizen either way if you ask me the second amendments inclusion of the right of the people is the dealsealer in every other use of the phrase there are  it is a reference to individual rightsit would be highly irregular for the founders to just throw the wording in there for kicks the individual right to kaba was considered so basic so essential they almost didnt include it also note that each militia member had to supply their own weaponry i guess the founders thought it was ok for the government to compel purchases as a component of basic citizenship  i wonder what you need to qualify for jus calamari citizenship i wonder what you need to qualify for jus calamari citizenship the point is that you can be a natural born citizen and still be born outside the us my sister was born in argentina but has always been a natural born us citizen and is eligible to run for president obamas mother is american and he has had a social security number since birth regardless of where he was born he is legally president i agree i think you misunderstood redditalreddys point i think she was trying to point out that it should never have been about where bho was born even if his mother had been in kenya for the birth he would still be a natural born american citizen as he was born to an american citizen really citizens born outside the us can run for prez theres hope for me yet you didnt read the natural born part did you my dad was born in the us i was born in the caribbean and have been an american citizen since the day i was born can i be presidentthis is all i want to know yes just get the money together and you can run for office when youre   as long as youve lived in the us or its territories for  years yep almost assuredly except what have you done on reddit to discredit yourself at the time of obamas birth for a child to claim american citizenship through a single american parent that parent had to have lived in the us for  years after hisher th birthday  obamas mother was  and he couldnt use that to claim citizenshipthis is of course irrelevant because obama was born in honolulu but if he was born in kenya he wouldnt have been a us citizen this is wrong obama would not have been ineligible even if he was born out of the country because his mother is a fullfledged us citizen you either need to be born in the country or have at least one parent who is a citizen to be a naturalized citizen the endthat to me is the most hilarious part about people demanding to see his birth certificate obama couldve been born on mars and it wouldnt make a difference at all not a naturalized citizen a natural born citizena naturalized us citizen is someone who was a citizen of another country and jumped through the hoops to become a us citizen a natural born citizen is someone who is a citizen by virtue of the circumstances of their birth ie mother was a citizen edit ohhhhhhh while my differentiation between natural born and naturalized is correct i totally misread narcodis post a child born to a  a naturalized citizen is a natural born citizen i should know this my dad is a naturalized citizen herp derp jus sanguis citizenship has flipped this way and that on several occasions over us historyowing to federal law as it stood in  obama would not have been a citizen of the united states if he were born abroad to a us citizen mother and a nonus citizen father  this was changed in the late searly s so that jus sanguis citizenship could follow the maternal line as well as the paternal one the only difference it would make is public opinionless votes maybe which doesnt seem to mean a whole lot anyways i believe their line of reasoning was that it would have effected some of the independents who would have otherwise voted for him and if he was indeed born on mars i am pretty sure that curious would be able to provide that information soon enough on a completely serious side note thank you for pointing out this much overlooked and all too often misunderstood fact i honestly just think people dont get that i didnt either but when i realized it it really makes the whole thing seem even more silly incorrectat the time he was born us law did not confer citizenship to someone born of one american parent off us soil i believe it only applied to american mothers and not fathers but im not positive who had not lived in the us for a certain period of time after turning  obamas mother was not old enough to pass on blood citizenship at that time try againdunham was three months shy of her th birthday when obama was born but subsequent acts of congress relaxed the requirement to five years in the us including just two years after the age of  meaning dunham could have been  and still qualified even if obama was born in another country volokh said congress made the law retroactive to  doubly covering obama gtif it could have been proven that obama was not born in the us he would have been ineligiblenot true no matter where he was born his mother was from kansas so he was a citizen at birth except the constitution doesnt say anything about being a citizen at birth if that were the case the first several presidents would not have been eligible instead it says you must be a naturalborn citizen which has never been explicitly defined and has been interpreted several different ways im not questioning obamas eligibility myself i just want to point out that it isnt so cutanddried gt if that were the case the first several presidents would not have been eligibleuntrue  the clause specifically states that those who were citizens at the time of the adoption of the constitution were also eligible ah good point no robots romney dismissed maybe its one of those macbeth clauses and they just didnt want anyone born via csection   aha so we need to see his mothers birth certificate why havent we seen that yet what is she hiding kansas shout out correct sirhe would have had dual citizenship in both the us and whatever country he may have been born in  i had a neighbor several years ago who was both japanese and american red head freckles pale skin and all because her father was stationed in japan at the time but she was born offbase at a japanese hospital  when she turned  she had the option of pursuing full citizenship in japan comment delete due to lack of correct knowledge why would that make him ineligible to be president there are only three requirements for eligibility be a natural born citizen be  or older and have been a resident of the us for  years he could have hidden all his money and it wouldnt have made him ineligible for the presidency ahh im going to have to reword my comment  i think youre right   is that because he would have had to admit to committing a felony  wouldnt the irs have some obligation to tell someone that the guy isnt eligible to be president  hey supreme court dont swear that guy in he commited a felony ah i guess it wouldnt disqualify him  im going to edit my comment id like to point out that your first statement is falsethe constitution sets the requirement that presidents must be natural citizens us law defines a natural citizen two ways being born on us soil jus soli being born to at least one parent who is a us citizen jus sanguiniseven if he was born in kenya his mother was a us citizen so the argument is completely invalid no there could be really bad consequences  would you want ever cpa out their looking at your tax returns if you had been bending the rules for a long long time yeah there is definitely something amiss about his tax returns otherwise he would have revealed them long ago you either have nothing to hide or youre hiding something that could destroy your chances of being elected  im sure the irs just takes a casual glance at romneys returns they probably wouldnt notice if he were a few million short facepalm not being audited does not mean he has not doing anything questionable on his returns  and for all we know the irs has open cases against romney i never mentioned an audit you mean the part where we find out romney is a criminal and hes utterly embarrassed and publicly destroyed hopefully fined millions in taxes and even more hopefully arrested for his theft yeah but were going to because he has to give in on this eventually find out just how shady he is i mean something really bad has to be in there right  if it was just oh he only pays  on most of his income hell take some heat but if its something to the tune of how hes really a billionaire because of offshore accounts or something thats going to be a whole different ball game  if from his tax returns it is revealed that hes evaded taxes it is a felony and that could make him ineligible to run for potus if romney committed a felony by lying on his sec forms would he be ineligible hasnt stopped republicans from putting scumbags in office before actually im fairly sure that tax evasion is a federal offense and hed be looking at jail time although i forget that the rules are different if youre wealthy obama was a natural born citizen the exact requirement written in the constitution to be president regardless of where he born because his mother was a us citizen he could have been born on mars ans still be eligible to be president no his mother was still american he would have been a natural born citizen of he was born on the moon would it mean hed be a criminal actually that is not true  since the early s natural born citizen means you inherited your citizenship from your mother or father  you dont actually have to be born within the united states  mccain was not born in the usa for examplein other words even if he was born in kenya or where ever he would still be eligible what if romney committed tax fraud that in and of itself would speak volumes as an european i dont get why you should be born in a country to become its president could you tell me why this is so important  has romney released his birth certificate might not find evidence that he is legally ineligible  but there might be something in there that makes voters think that he is not eligible to hold the office due to his bad behavior it doesnt actually matter if youre born in the us the constitution requires you to be a natural born citizen which you can be even if youre born in another country as long as your parents are both citizens  gah i hate defend piece shit romney citizenship actual requirement office potus income statements not and obama provided proof  whereas romney bucked tradition by only releasing a single yearand that single year contained odd discrepancies such as how the heck you get  million dollars in an ira when the contribution limit is k a year i read an article explaining that pretty clearly instead of contributing cash you contribute shares of stock that are for whatever reason guaranteed to rise dramatically its pretty shifty and only rich people with connections and deft accountants can take as much advantage of it as romney has but its not illegal it does however provide another example of how the luck of an elite birth has tilted so many playing fields in his favour could he have rolled over k worth x million into an ira i dont believe so from what i understand you can only purchase non s corporation stock bonds and treasury stock with an ira and its not so much contributing these assets into an ira you can use the money in your ira to purchase these assets ah i rolled over a small k into my roth ira and it didnt count toward my contributions that year as in i could still contribute  i assumed the same was true for an ira it may be i am not too familiar with ira laws but i remember reading an article that made a big deal about what i described this leads me to believe that this is the most savvy thing you can do with an ira perhaps i am wrong mhm penis hm dont ask me im neither an accountant nor american   money buys the best including accountants so it would seem rather foolish for a rich man to not take advantage of those loopholes  loopholes were not meant to be used  it means that romney is several hundred years old and probably a vampire  it also means he was born before the us existed and is thus not a natural born citizen well its fine if hes that oldrelevant part of the constitutionno person except a natural born citizen or a citizen of the united states at the time of the adoption of this constitution shall be eligible to the office of president neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years and been fourteen years a resident within the united states are vampires people  maybe if they are incorporated they qualify but just a vampire would have been a person but not currently one i was going to post exactly that but i thought it would be going over the line of absurdity in this subreddit im glad it worked out only if the undead count i dont think so we need a birth certificate to be sure perhaps he is one of joseph smiths moon people obama provided proof after years of people demanding it i personally hope he doesnt release iti cant believe more republicans arent asking to vet it before the conventioni personally think romney is just waiting until his nomination is official and then is going to release it when it is too late for the gop to have cold feetthe guy is choosing to walk around with a political kick me sign on it because why  super strong moral conviction  taking a stand against invasive tax disclosurewhen top gop strategists are starting to call for the release of more years you may reconsider whether this is still a crazy liberal gotcha conspiracy by contributing stock with value within the limit if the stock appreciates its a loophole that increases the value of your ira tax deferred he bucked tradition is that relevant at all to the presidency  lets see you max out the contribution each year and then make some incredibly goodlucky investmentsstop calling these odd discrepancies gt lets see you max out the contribution each year and then make some incredibly goodlucky investmentslets say  years of k  that is k  mk  x rate of return years ago apple stock was at  a share  it is now at   that is a x multiplier and that is assuming he had all k to invest immediately in so he is apparently better at investing than a time traveler  seems totally legit have you ever heard of leverage  futures options  apparently not  ever heard of compounding  no i didnt think soromney is   he could have been investing in his ira for nearly  years  lets say its just been  yearsinvesting k each year for  years means you need to make an average of  each year  and thats a nominal return includes inflation from interest  there were some incredibly high interest rates back in the late s early s  the average interest rate for the past  years is around the  markso that means he needed to make     again thats without any leverage  if you leverage yourself a reasonable x you only need to make  on your investment  and there were some killer returns in the searly s for alternative investments  the previous hedge fund i worked at had annualized  return in the san ira is the perfect place to take a lot of risk if you can afford it its the best payoff tax wise  so if romney was always doing well money wise it makes perfect sense to take risks in his ira annualized return doesnt look so crazy does it gt romney is  he could have been investing in his ira for nearly  years lets say its just been  yearshe was only at bain for  years  that is how many years he had to contribute to that accountthe fact that he was also in charge of running the retirement account program at bain at the same time im sure has nothing to do with anythingbut it is hard to say with a straight face that the single tax return he released is sufficient to answer these questions okay well maybe romney is following obamas standard and is planning to releasing his tax returns three years after being elected president  nobody had asked obama to release them before that obamas mother was born in the us thats undisputed as such obama has full citizenship even if he was born in kenya or antarctica or anywhere else if you must know this point is not well settled law  the requirement is generally interpreted by most constitutional scholars to require the candidate be born on us soil  being born to a us citizen is not alone sufficient under this prevailing view this is why congress passed a resolution specifically declaring that john mccain was a naturalized us citizen because he was born on a us military base over seas   still have to be born on us soil to be presidentedit  apparently im wrong gt no you actually dont bubyou have to be a natural born citizen there are two forms of natural born citizenship jus soli and jus sanguini the constitution doesnt specify which one anyone born to american parents even on foreign soil is a natural born citizen by jus sanguini not sure about that id have to research   here you go researcheditin case youre lazygtif one parent is a us citizen and the other parent is not the child is a citizen ifthe us citizen parent has been physically present in the us before the childs birth for a total period of at least five years andat least two of those five years were after the us citizen parents fourteenth birthday yep you would it has never been legally tested but john mccain ran for president under the assumption that those born to american parents on foreign soil in his case on a military base in the panama canal zone are indeed eligible for office  this article from mentions others who have faced the question throughout history including mitts father george romney who was simply born in mexico not on a military base or anything get on it because i was about to say the exact same thing realigion didalso it could be argued john mccain was unfit but as someone else posted here they addressed this situation already you have to be a natural born citizen which does not require being born on us soil  an explanation can be found here if this wasnt the case mccain would probably not have been eligible  citizenship can actually be proven with a mere passport as well which im sure obama hadand although citizenship is a requirement for potus perhaps obama only needs to provide that proof to certain parties and not necessarily the public at largeanother requirement for potus is that you cannot currently be serving a prison sentence something that will need to be verified is not in romneys future given his tax returns i hate to get technical on you but the requirement is that a person must be born in the us and not simply a citizen passports cant prove that true but i dont think anyone is saying that not releasing his taxes prevents him from being able to run what it does do is put a huge question as to what he is hiding because he is hiding something its just to big of a political hit to not simply release them so whatever is in there is political suicide how can you trust a man like him who is hiding so much to represent this country and defend the rights a its citizens but thats just it in this country if you dont show something that youre not obligated to show you may look like youre hiding something but it doesnt prove that you are hiding something same reason we have illegal search and seizure laws it may be bad form but theres no reason that romney has to do it so mexicans not showing their immigration papers are just savypoliticians youre also not obligated to run for officeits an election its all about appearance and popular opinion he does himself no favors yeah if there was nothing wrong with them it would be really beneficial for him to release the tax returns to show people they can have faith in the man in some form otherwise hes taking a huge risk in not releasing them if nothing is wrong it would make no sense imo  libertarianism focuses on personal responsibility  yet one cant control where one is born  but you are definitely responsible for how you pay your taxes that has zero to do with my statement oh potus what a fabulous acronym i am with you on this one he released what he was required to release it is the whole if you dont have anything to hide there wont be a problem sort of thing just because he prefers to keep some things private we cant assume he has done anything wrongdont get me wrong here i despise romney and i do think there are probably some tax issues he wants to hide but i dont think he should be obligated to release them if he doesnt want to no matter how curious we are just on a matter of principle  gtgah i hate to actually defend that piece of shit romneyyeah i hear ya  i dont like the guy either but this is one thing i dont really blame him for  as we saw with the whole birther fiasco giving in and producing documents doesnt really get you anywhere  you show tax filings and itll probably be only a few hours before someone claims that youre lying on them and demands to see other financial records  if candidates tax records are that important we can pass a law that requires disclosure  i think we can all assume that romney pays a low rate anyway he proved citizenship x over and yet birthers are still at it romney has produced one partial year of tax returns and even that wreaks of antipatriotism  hed be skewered if the shoe was on the other side  true  but refusing to do it makes it seem like he is hiding something  also he has demanded others to released theirslegally speaking you are right  he is in a horrible position though no matter what he does since it seems like he must have something to hide and obama provided proof and hawaii said he was born there and so did a newspaper article and well you get the picture there was no doubt no controversy it was manufactured by the right to be a distraction because fuck if the republicans could run on a record they just got done shitting on the country for  years  evading taxes is a crime how do these schiesty fuckers get away with not paying their share and hiding their assets wed be in jail for lesser tax crimes  youre correct if the issue were only about what is legally required but the issue is what the american voters customarily require prior to voting for a candidate a huge precedence has been set and to willfully ignore that indicates that he is placing himself above the standards we voters demand he certainly has the legal right to refuse just as voters have the right to decide what that really means and refuse to vote for him providing your birth certificate publicly is not a requirement it is not traditional as far as i know it has never been asked of any previous presidential candidate providing it as part of the vetting process definitely is providing your tax returns publicly is only for a year but still providing your tax returns publicly for more than a year while not required is traditional a tradition started by romneys father  there was no fucking reason to doubt obamas citizenship when every other presidential candidate has never had to face such questions because theyre white and releasing tax returns is a tradition started by romneys father anyone who doesnt adhere to it is likely shady or has something to hide because the liability of not releasing it is pretty harmful down boy im not a birther  i was answering ops question youre implicitly justifying their concerns which annoys me theyre a bunch of bigots  providing an hypothetical explanation  justifying my dad complained politics rife with spurious accusations scandals tax returns take real issues except favorite topics  years obamas birth certificate muslim beliefs etcpeople reasonable high minded when works their favor    kinda like how reddit was when the hillary camp was demanding obamas birth certificatenow we get dozens of submissions a month about romneys personal finances it was a reasonable question to ask about obamas birth certificate before he provided his legal birth certificate in june  while i agree that this is rather hypocritical it certainly is not unwarranted romney is running for the president of the united states of america and has been accused of tax fraud obama had already been elected president and his citizenship verified by the state of hawaii one is to confirm the legitimacy of a presidential candidate while the other was in my opinion a childish ploy for the sole purpose of causing troubleim not overly informed on these issues so please forgivecorrect me if i am incorrect or misleading in any of my informationedit as far as i know everything about obamas birth certificate was pure speculation with no real reason to doubt his citizenship as for romneys taxes isnt it already known that he has lied about which state he lived in to receive a tax break absolutely everyone likes to think theyre better than the rest but succumbs nonetheless to these diversionary issues and those issues are only ridiculous when theyre about your guy agree completely  now they got dirty harry reid spouting off bout some unnamed source and the media once again gets diverted  so the media will talk about that for the next week or so and before you know it its election time and nobody knows anything about either candidate besides that they both suck   rpolitics is funjust toss a rock in there and the down syndrome little fucks will stab each other over itdefinition of a circle jerk the term is used too much on reddit but for politics and atheism it is correct the usual repost rules are ignored just to get another stab at romney or the fotm republican hate doll you people all bitch about rpolitics but you realize you guys live here right its like shitting where you eat its a circlejerk or groupthink because its overwhelmingly dominated by liberals most of whom just want to rant and lecture not discuss anyone who dissents is immediately punished with a sea of downvotes no most of the shitting is from people who browse all and are just flabbergasted by the ignorance that a default subreddit shows you mean like this entire thread ripping on romney for not releasing his tax returns ive spent  minutes looking and i cant find one proromney statement  of these comments are idiotic at best sorry had to say that at some point and i chose your comment doesnt this just prove his case even more he was right according to your anecdote its just that even he isnt above all this and maybewait for itwait for itneither are youedit and neither am i for that matter none of us are gtdoesnt this just prove his case even more he was right according to your anecdote its just that even he isnt above all this and maybewait for itwait for itneither are yougtedit and neither am i for that matter none of us arethats what i was saying my point was that he was exactly right he just wasnt appying it fairly to himself and his side or now bear with me people who are truly highminded can keep that healthy skepticism for all candidates  i think its obvious that those who do mental gymnastics to use one set of rules for those they dislike and another for those who they like are not highminded and are indeed small minded idiots aka the majority of voters  tldr people like favors arpaio says obama birth record is fraudulent i dont mean to insult your dad or anything but i really really hope you rubbed his face in his own irony as hard as you fucking couldi know my dad would expect nothing less of me if he pulled a dumb like thatof course so far as were concerned its a form of endearment sort of like this thread its rmoney release tax returnshe decided wont release them too hide the irs must be happy they are in order  else hed be in jail surely if its about the source of the income eg consultancy for a suspected russian organised crime unit then does the cia vet all the candidates for president  nobody is accusing him of doing anything illegal people just want to see his tax returns to see if hes telling the truth when he says that he pays a fair amount of taxes actually people are saying he has possibly done something illegal with his offshore accounts and whether or not he got amnesty for onesome of them  if so he is still a criminal just a forgiven one ah id forgotten about that still we shouldnt even be having this discussion anyone who wont release their tax returns should be immediately disqualified from running for president especially someone who refuses with such obvious disdain for us people perhaps there should be a set of standard rules that each candidate must provide birth certificate tax returns for self and spouse for last  years  results of a recent medical to be undertaken just prior to the election no need to see a long personal history declaration of current shareholdings and directorships hes made it a point to never say he paid a fair amount of taxes  he only says he pays a legal amount of taxes so why not release them what are you a cop trying to search a house implying that keeping something private means youre hiding somethingthat being said i do think he probably is hiding something but he shouldnt be obligated to give up his right to privacy if i were id damn sure have a warrantwhat are you a romney apologist he sure as hell wont give a shit about your privacy just like he didnt give a shit about kennedys when he ran for the senate or shannon obriens husband when she ran for gov no i despise romney my opinion is based on the principle that most everyone should have a reasonable right to privacy regardless of how much we may like or dislike them i dont care whether he cares about my privacy that doesnt have anything to do with my point he didnt have a problem providing them to mccain in  when he wanted to be vpit shouldnt be a problem now so its okay to approach this as if you wont show us everything then you must be hiding something does that mean its also okay for a cop to assume if you wont let us search your person car and home without a warrant then you must be hiding something in his case yesand in the second case yes but the cop still needs a warrant so wanting some semblance of privacy  hiding something got it presidential candidates shouldnt expect much in the way of privacyjust ask carter the bushs clinton and obama this is the elephant in the room well he is a repube i love randomly capitalized words and the effect of randomly capitalized words seems lost on the truly ignorant you dont say typo on purpose yes so i guess you dont agree with the th amendment sure i do its the last refuge of the guilty theres already an issue of the beginnings and that is being modest of class warfareenvyso the man has a lot of money he probably realizes that there are americans that have an issue with people that have wealth maybe hes just not releasing them because this blame game is the lesser of the two evils guilty until proven innocent noand in regards to op post being a natural born citizen is a requirement for the job releasing x amount of tax returns isnt to my knowledge gttheres already an issue of the beginnings and that is being modest of class warfareenvymore like the privileged rich guy wants to break the precedent that his father set  years ago simply because he feels he is privileged which is the same argument the birthers were making before obama released his birth certificate ah you know this for a fact or youre speculating out your ass id like to see what you say when he does release them you gonna eat crow or come up with some excuses and push the issue like the fringe birthers you so rightfully mock what other explanation could there possibly be for his adamant refusal to release his tax records yesnoi will say its about fucking time you should have listened to your dadi hear chicfoolya tastes like crow crows ass anyways will that suffice may i ask how you know it for a fact or is this also an anonymous source the nda i signed prevents me from divulging my sourcesee how that works oh yeah completely i know youre a pedophile but i too signed an nda oh man i never brought uprpolitics before its sad they cant go after him for the patriot act or draft dodging  constant mentioning of class warfare and we all feed right into it what does romney have to do with the patriot act obama voted for it and reauthorized it all you have to do is put the word romney next to anything unpopular here on reddit tsa patriot act war on drugs indefinite detention etc and its an upvote machine  you mention for a second that our lord and savior mr obama supports all these facts and you get downvoted to oblivion  let the downvotes commence   redditors also seem to forget or choose to ignore that hillary clinton was the one that started the birther movement i honestly dont get the point of all of this people know that romney is scum this was established a long time ago finding out what romney pays in taxes isnt likely to swing many voterslook at his policy it is terrible romney wants to repeal all environmental restrictions and let corporations ravage our country he wants to cut taxes on the richest americans and put us further in debt he wants to get us into another massive war with iran and spend billions upon billions of dollars in israel he wants to send us back to the s in regards to womens rightsi could go on but fuck why should i why should anyone need to go any further than looking at his policy to realize that he would be terrible as our president im not fully behind obama but i sure as hell will vote for him over romney i just dont get why people are trying to make this a big deal when its likely to not matter at allthink about it if this really was a big deal do you think it would be brought up in julyaugust of course not this would have been brought up in midoctober if it was something that the democrats believed would really hurt romney the democratic leadership obviously doesnt think this is that big of a deal but for some reason rpolitics thinks this is the scandal that will destroy romney im so glad americas hyperwealthy have brave souls like you to stand up for them  hey at least its a self post i fucking hate this subreddit  makes me feel like im part of a thought mob that yells loudest about the same class of perceived injustices as morons on fox news foam about were just really pissed about it okay fuck itwe require you elected office president united statesbirth certificatepast  years tax formscollege transcriptsdrug testall legal filesat we shut fuck up stupid shit im sure things would go smoothly after that you mean the same things required for applying to any other decent job  nah we cant have that well ive never been asked for tax returns a job or my birth certificate most jobs even my professional ones dont ask for college transcripts only ever took one drug test for walmart back in the day and im not even sure what all legal files is he means that potential presidential candidates should mirror the contents of their computer hard drives on the internet for all to view except for the illegal files which they can keep hidden you should not have to go to college to get a decent job no shit this is all such a fucking circle jerk i would be more likely to vote for a president that tested positive for oval office herb you left out facebook password we want that too dont really care about the drug tests or college transcripts on the other hand many legal files may still be confidential for legitimate reasons at the same time  years of tax forms is a pretty trivial amount no reason it should only be  years and birth certificate is already required you wont even be able to enter a primary election without that being certified look how good that fact worked also penis size sorry we need a family tree going back at least  generations what are you hiding upvoted for making me lol people will argue about the right to privacy somehow free speech will get involved big government interfering will also be used some will even say politicians need their secrets otherwise nothing can happen anything to keep the status quo now back to complaining about employers asking for facebook logins i agree with birth certificate and the taxes but the college transcripts and drug test are a little much what does college actually say about a person as far as im concerned people are not adults wen they are in college im currently a college junior it is a time of exploration and discovery even then what if i want to become the president what would my f in my physics lab when i was  tell anyone about my ability to run the country absolutely nothing taxes show us how an individual has contributed to their country financially if that person did there best job avoiding said responsibility so be it let the electorate judge him but judging a person based on if they handed in all their homeworks or showed up to all their classes  years ago is meaninglesseditspelling whats problem released  years vp cant release single presidencyno wonder sarah palin chosen palin was clearly chosen to appeal to far right conservatives and evangelicals  romney as weve seen does not  that is the entirety of why mccain made the vp decision he did  its completely valid to demand romneys tax returns  but this mccain didnt chose romney because he saw his taxes meme thats been going around is ridiculous   isnt mccain also repeatedly saying romney should release his records i believe someone was saying this morning that no he isnt calling for romneys taxes but he also isnt part of the brigade calling reid a liar infer what you will oh we will we will as someone said above the far right was never in danger of not voting for mccain over obama  so im not really sure that was the reason they chose palin it was an attempt at the novelty vote first black president well need a black vice president sir we dont have any black republicans in national politics with the name recognition to get elected except colin powell erm how about women well condaleezza rice refused the position publicly and that leaves one crazy governor from alaska fuck sarah palin was the governor of alaska not a senator  yeah i knew that dont know why i typed it out wrong whos the alaskan senator in that story governor the mccain campaign never thought those folks were going to vote for obama  but they correctly believed that those folks would not be sufficiently motivated to actually vote  post election polling showed that palin did get those people to the polls  unfortunately for them she also alienated more moderate voters  her impact wasnt big enough to actually change the outcome of the election though    they were hoping to improve turn out many evangelicals were luke warm on mccain and they were calculating that if they got a strong enough push from the base it would be enough to put him over unfortunately for them palin alienated more moderates and independents than anything else  the report by mccains people slammed romney for a lot of things but not his taxes and they from what i understand actually saw them  but realistically he called for others to do it to show they had nothing to hide and yet he isnt even doing it for himself  especially when people are questioning it  i dont think its that ridiculous because when you keep people in the dark questions will keep coming up in that election romney was the far right candidate  you forgot the play to the female vote romney ran as a right wing conservative  but mike huckabee was much more popular among those folks   heres the deal there are probably  voters whose vote turns on seeing his returns why would he release them especially when hes getting so much media attention its all negative attention the democrats will keep repeating he paid zero taxes over and over until people start to believe its the truth ever heard even bad pr is good pr yes but im not sure that applies here from what i understand the idea that all pr is good pr works only because the pr increases name recognition realistically romney and obama cant increase their name recognition any more at this point all they can do is try to change the opinion of an everdecreasing pool of voters who havent made up their mind yet bad press at this point can seriously hurt a candidate yes it helps with name recognition but the more youre in the news the more people think about you and they arent thinking about the headline theyre thinking about the reasons they still like you pretty much all press is good unless youve done something horrible no one is changing their minds based on the tax returns theres no benefit to releasing them wait romney has released  years of tax records why havent i heard this and why arent we going through those with a fine tooth comb mccain is the only one who saw them then he chose palin you can draw your own conclusions holy shit what could this guy be hiding in his taxes that would make anyone want to choose palin i mean i hate romney as much as the next intelligent dude but for reals palin is just scary i would vote for romney before palin that he paid less in taxes than you did  and i mean in total dollars not just as a percentage    last year is more in absolute dollars than you or any of us make so sorry to break it to you but what you said is extremely unlikely yeah and youre right about that one year but if reid is right then this would be different for these other years in question cmon this is such obvious political theater by not distancing themselves from reids comments the obama campaign is cleverly setting themselves up for a winwin situation wheres the transparency and accountability that the obama candidacy leaned so heavily on in the  elections this is cheap political theater they are engaging in and not only are liberals not calling him out on it but they are eating it up hook line and sinker  last year  i believe the allegation is that he paid  tax dollars  it was a joke sorry to break it to you but you dont understand humor  romney already paid m in  he did so as an estimate  a tax estimate usually is done when you expect to pay more than  mm in taxes and later in the year more defined payments are made as the exact tax liability is determined  your estimate has to be close to actual payment  so you cant pay  now and wait six months and pay the rest average americans can do this as well pay an estimate or better yet just file an extension and owe the taxes in late october citation needed  not that i dont think romney is a poor presidential candidate but you really should provide some sort of evidence when you say something that damning   and if you had a tax attorney by your side you could do the same thing there are plenty of legal ways to save money plenty legal legitimate ways its not as if every move to save tax money is some sly thing who knows if he bought up forest land as an easement and wrote of the value  i never said he did anything illegal  and if he had he wouldnt have put it in his tax returns  however ive got a feeling that a lot of americans arent going to want to vote for a billionaire who pays less in taxes then they do and it appears that his campaign team agrees with that   clearly you have a complete grasp on not only corporate tax laws but tax lays in general he pays more in taxes than the average american thats just a fact theres no way around it when you make that much money regardless of your tax write offs what bothers me about this whole issue is that hes done pretty much the same as any other american including obama yet that isnt looked upon as shady or being nontransparent its legal  its not unethical and majority of people use the laws to their advantage you have to expect that when you tax people as hard as the us does the more you ask the harder people will look for a way out personally i think were fucked no matter who runs our government has its head up its own ass and soon itll be up chinas our culture effectively destroyed our government we care far too much about money enough to let it corrupt our politicians through lobbyists and special interest groups who have no business in the political realm we divide ourselves into political parties and foster a national sense of group thinking which leaves us running in circles life lesson plug the leak before you try to drain out the water ps if you define yourself by who you vote for or what political party you favor you failed at life learn to think for yourself dont be a democrat dont be a republican be an informed american the thing is not everyone can not unless you have a preset amount of money to throw into things which are good at getting you deductions from looking at reddit i can guess most of the people on here dont even own the land they live on so that takes many ways outand one of the larger things is that hes probably cooking his books like a madman and doesnt want people to see just what hes paying taxes on i understand but that doesnt mean that he cantthe irs is very particular about things like that book cooking isnt like it used to be you cant get away with taking unwarranted deductions you will be audited for a big hitter like romney who consistently finds tax deduction strategies im sure the irs will not let him get away with taking more off they will either audit him or reduce his deduction ratiosi dont doubt he pays very low taxes however it is legal and he has a right to additionally its not his fault if he has a really high deduction ratio its the irs fault for not auditing him  thats not true  for most people who have a regular job and a single home and just enough for food car kids karate classes there are few ways to hide your income and still survive   if you had a tax attorney and a vast sum of wealth to take advantage of the tax code you mean  no there arent not legally you cant hide earned income anymore through tax shells the loopholes have been gone for two decades if you file taxes with w reported income it cannot be hiddenbusiness losses are still allowed but limited to income producing businesses now eg your home typing business can only offset as much money as it actually makes except for active real estate investment where you are allowed k per year of losses but this is only a net gain in in pretty specific special cases you really dont know how many ways there are to get tax deductions the loopholes are there and they are legitimate i mentioned a single way to reduce taxes easements its not hiding earned income its getting tax bill reductions  you know there are other considerations for choosing a vp like stances on issues electability etc that dont have to do with tax returns its obvious there is more than one reason that palin was chosen over romney  women voters are a demographic that leans on the left so palin was a way to pander to a group of people who wouldnt normally go out and vote for mccain  palin was also probably chosen because she probably seems like a more friendlier person at face value  i just dont think the republicans realized that she didnt even have a basic understanding how the federal government functioned because clearly thats the only consideration for vp unlike you know the billion other important issues important issues remember when they chose palin you honestly believe romney wasnt chosen due to tax reasons its not like he had to release them if he was chosen anyway so theres clearly nothing to hide only reason  no  but i do think there was something in there that really spooked mccain and hastened his selection of palin you obviously dont understand politics if you believe mitts taxes had anything to do with the vp selection thats fox news logic throw out a fact throw out another fact with the implication that the former caused the latter follow up with draw your own conclusionsplease dont copy them false causalities and conspiracy theories are all over the place theres no need to add moreif you have proof that this was a major factor in the decision then by all means share itfrom my own liberal point of view it wouldnt have made much sense for mccain to pick romney they are both rich white perceived to be moderate conservatives mccain needed a conservative to balance his ticket although he could have done a hell of a lot better than palin in order to get the base out to vote he released them to john mccains team not to the public he released them to the mccain campaigns vetting team not to the public he released them to  person not to the public do you honestly believe his tax returns were the reason he wasnt hired rhetorical hes released his  returns his partial  returns with a commitment to release the full returns once they are completed  hes committed to releasing the same number of returns that every republican candidate has released since the  electionsfeel free to bash him for not having his  returns out there yet but youre wrong when you say he hasnt released a single one he has not released his complete  returns  he has released  years of complete tax returns mitt and ann romney have released their complete  tax return and an estimate of their  return a full copy of their final  return will be made public as soon as it is filed in the upcoming weeks the romneys have provided extensive information about their personal finances with several hundred pages of tax returns now made public the users stating that romneys tax returns for  are incomplete are referring to the lack of fbar forms that should have also been disclosed to the irshes released his  tax returns but there does not appear to be a recent year for which romney has made a true and honest disclosure of his full financial dealings so they lied about it too  that does not endear me further to w mitt romney i dont think many people are really worried about the  returns its the older returns that people are questioning   were the s complete did they omit the filings for the swiss accounts  mitt and ann romney have released their complete  tax return and an estimate of their  return a full copy of their final  return will be made public as soon as it is filed in the upcoming weeks the romneys have provided extensive information about their personal finances with several hundred pages of tax returns now made public oh so because he said so we are just rolling with iti read on some left wing propaganda site that this wasnt accurate so did he actually release the info about the swiss accounts or not so much upvote for making me think you were linking to daily kos  totally smiled when i saw it was drudge this is a huge skew of the facts  bush released many years of returns in  and made his returns public in the coming years which means that in  there were even more years to consider  mccain was the outlierin the last  years youre correct on bush in  when he released his returns from when he was in officeother than that mittens is right in line with the majority of presidential candidates and the number of returns theyve released prior to running for office for the first time how is releasing one year in line  also this chart doesnt show al gore micheal dukakis bob dole or john kerry  all of whom submitted multiple yearsyour source very clearly skews the facts i already acknowledged this in another reply so you agree that his actions are not in line with the majority of presidential candidates yes i stand corrected the site i was using for information did not have complete information he hasnt even paid his taxes yet if i remember correctly he got them differed until october well proof us birth requirement president question justified time tax records however requirement president instead they requirement prove you arent hypocrite you do actually have to show proof of birth certificate to be president the law isnt there just for fun asking the first time because people just didnt believe this black guy with a foreign name was born here wasnt justified nobody asked bush or clinton even once we know they had to provide that shit to run so we didnt need to actually see the proof hes not just a black guy with  funny name his father was a foreign national and he spent much of his childhood overseas asking was completely justified obama did provide proof before he even ran for presidentdid he provide that proof to youno because you dont mean shit when it comes to verifying the presidents citizenship down boy did you just hear meno one gives a shit about your opinion including president obamabad dog bad enjoy  more years of obama what from kindergarden to fifth grade he was overseas  getting indoctrinated in madrassas  then he just hid that muslim programming like a submarine for  years so he could be president  wow such planning i cant let this go the question about obamas birth was never justified to begin with obama had already proven his eligibility via  international travel and  by being a us senator this was the same threshold that john mccain who was actually born outside of the united states in panama was subject toyou end up in some semantic twists and conspiracy logic by saying things like its easy to fake a us passport and people trick the us secret service all the time otherwisemy concern is that people have on some level decided that yes it was a reasonable question to begin with when it wasnt and now we have something legitimate and theres a chance romney may get elected without providing this information which speaks directly to his proposed tax policies and general character maybe its because his own book says he was born in kenyanot only that but this book was published and edited about ever  to  years and resigned off on it every time so obama is a liar either way either hes lying about being born in hawaii or he was lying about being born in kenya which was in his book that was published for  years soooooo yeah its still a fair question consdering all the layers to the document go download it from the gov website its an illustrator file with multiple layers i dont know if you know how scanners work but you cant move parts of a scanned document around individually there are multiple layers how anyone can say it hasnt been manipulated is beyond me only someone completely ignorant of photoshop illustrator and editing programs could possibly try and claim that is a scan of an official document hawaii refused to put in writing that they had his birth certificate we only are told this from a judge who received an email which would not even be admissable in court as that is hearsay from a rd party so yeah nice try i dont like romney either but lets not pretend everything is completely kosher here with obama because thats a jokelol thats the funny part everyone will slam romney for lying as if obama doesnt lie about anything and seemingly everything im not going to sign the ndaa signs it i will label gmos doesnt and appoints the ex ceo of monsanto to the head of the fda and the ex attorney for monsanto to supreme court says he thinks there should be more transparency hasnt taken questions or done a press conference since june where he took  questions on foreign policy says he thinks executive privelage shouldnt be used uses it to cover up fast and furious when eric holder was held in contempt says he wanted to end the wars started new wars he says he will do things legally then circumvents the constitution with only un approval and informs congress he will let them know what he decides with the un he said he would get unemployment below  unemployment is officially at  but only because after  years you dont qualify for unemployment and are magically no longer unemployed despite still not having a job so realistically closer to  and up to  in some regions highest unemployment ever for african americans says we need to cut spending then spends more money than all other us presidents combined but does it in the first year and doesnt count that on his spending reports people use when quoting numbers to make it look like bush did it yeah poster boy for honesty right there i cant answer to your first claim on the born in kenya thing but your argument about the multiple layers is apparently erroneouswhich makes me question the validity of your other claims you had me for a sec thereedit the born in kenya thing wasnt even written by obama and was later said to be a factchecking errorwhich makes sense unless youre a big fan of conspiracy theories he goes to brietbartcom the central hub of conspiracy nuts lol yes a fact checking error on the cover of his book that nobody brought up none of his family friends etc in over  years of publishing printing and re editing and reprinting if you buy that then i have beach from property in louisiana id like to sell you so if it was a lie you are okay with believing the people that lied to you about it tell you its not a lie you do see the logical fallacy in that right or have you spent that much time on reddit you can no longer even tell gt a fact checking error on the cover of his bookwhat it was not in his book did you even try to verify this or do you just believe what you believe without questioning whether youre making a mistake not even the breitbart article you linked says it was in his own book breitbart says it was on a cached page of dystelcom a little more investigation suggests it was also in some pamphlet produced by literary agents from dystel and sent around to important persons in the publishing business it wasnt in any of obamas booksi took you seriously when i read your original comment i thought your claims called for serious consideration and investigation your apparent lack of factchecking abilities and your apparent insistence that your original post is still true however makes me doubt your credibility and i dont know how seriously i can take you as any more than a conspiracy theorist hating obama for hatingobamas sake my friend has the book and he says its on the books inside sleeve of the cover you know how they fold around the hard cover and was also on the website you do realize there are often more facts about something than a single source will report about it was also printed on the pamphlet flyers that they handed out as well it was on all the marketing materials from the website to the book so again checking to see if something is a lie by asking the person who is lying is a logical fallacy it doesnt work we dont ask criminals if they commit crimes and just take their word for it we use evidence there are pictures of the book a cached website and pamphlets that were used and stayed up on the website for over  years up until the year he ran they knew they were there and he was lying then or lying now theres no way he didnt know they were promoting it that way imo since a person can legally qualify for a us passport without being a natural born citizen your argument is a red herring the problem with your argument is that natural born citizen isnt actually defined any where  having had a passport since i was a kid and knowing what you need to do in order to get one the above is simply not trueheres the lastest info from the us state departmentits not a red herring it was a ridiculous request to begin with to have a us passport a person must be a citizento qualify to be the us president a person must be a natural born citizen meaning they received citizenship at birththe two requirements are not identical im sorry but you are ignorant and misinformed it is quite common to acquire us citizenship after birth via the process of naturalisation becoming a us citizen in this way does not meet the requirement stipulated by the us constitution that the president be a natural born citizen do some research before responding but there were no naturalisation records for president barrack obama because he was born in hawaii which is what the birth certificate he used to apply for a passport showed and what the state of hawaii provided in june  even though obama didnt need to produce that document to begin withi am pretty informed on the topic my point being it was a ridiculous request to begin withhopefully this clears things up for you you may be informed but your last statement was flat out wrong there is no independently authenticated birth certificate either the only court that has looked at it has declared it a fraudyou are a lot less informed than you think are  what court said this only fraud proof ive heard of came from sheriff joe and ill take the word of an entire us state more seriously than i will a votegrubbing show investigation by americas most embarrassing lawman thats just not right my dad was born in russia but is a us citizen and has a passport so he would be ineligible for presidency but still has a passport but were not talking about a hypothetical passport were talking about barrack obamas passport his application included the birth certificate from hawaii which showed his place of birthi shouldve been more clear with this in my response true but my point was obama showed a birth certificate to get a passport and obamas birth certificate showed he was a us citizen all anybody knew was that he had a passport you claimed or seemed to claim that that should suffice for people to believe he was a naturally born citizen people mentioned this wasnt true nobody knew about what was on his application for a passport as that had not been released so hence they askednow i agree with you that the issue was pushed way too far and probably didnt need to be brought up in the first place but the rpolitics circlejerk about these tax records and especially reids disgusting you prove youre not a liar comments are really along the same vein this equals hypocrisy and the lack of many on rpolitics to realize this indicates the blind partisanship that so many believe defines the republicanreligious voter this is the crux of my point there are citizens who think that this issue of the tax returns is simply partisanit isnt to be clear im not saying its ridiculous for a presidential candidate to prove they are a citizen im saying that when the question of barrack obamas citizenship was raised the point was moot because hed already proven it in other words if tax returnsproof of natural born citizenship obama had already proven and provided it by this point in the campaignthe other reason i think citizens need to see romneys returns is that they speak directly to mitt romneys tax policies and the impact that he could have as president he wants to lower taxes on people who have the kind of wealth that he and president obama currently have among the reasons is that the rich pay too much i dont know when i had to get my gaming permit for the casino the last five years of my tax returns were reviewedthen for the military in order to get a secret clearence there was a review on my taxesi would think that there should be more of a requirement for the presidential position much of that is to see if someone couldleverage any discrepencies against you for clearence a friend of mine had an issue getting a secret clearance as his foreign wife had property overseas in her name  he couldnt get his clearance until it was sold xpost rbraveryjerk benned nothing brave about bashing republicans in rpolitics two years hell father claims born kenya my former manager is the same way he claims its not out of racism but because he just doesnt like him or his policies so its ok to try and go after him with ad hominem attacks hes a tennessee country boy though soim pretty sure theres a little bit of racism in there so basically you believe in stereotypes as much as you think your former manager does because you cant disagree with obamas policies if you are white and southern unless you are racist doesnt that make you just as judgemental as you claim other people are gtbecause you cant disagree with obamas policies if you are white and southern unless you are raciststereotypes exist for a reason dont try to tell me theres not more disapproval of barack obama in southern states i dont even know what stereotype youre thinking he was using for barack obama a black kenyan muslim antichristdevil lizard i can say that theres more than likely a hint of racism in his decision because he disowned his daughter for dating a black guygtdoesnt that make you just as judgemental as you claim other people areprobably but i can back my conclusions up though with reasons not based on solely on this feels right so it must be true no matter what first you did not preface your remark with my manager has exhibited racist tendencies in the past so you said he disapproved of obama because he is from the south and obama is black im not a mind reader im using the hes a southern white boy so he must hate blacks stereotype because that is the information you provided and insinuated second whether or not all southerners tend to not like obama based on skin color is moot you were talking about one man in one instance to say otherwise is to assume stereotypes on your end third if there is more disapproval down south for the president cite your sources rather than claim racism otherwise it feels like this feels right so it must be true no matter what fourth learn how to argue  make a point back it with logic and defend seriously dont try to tell me is not a defense of your position  ok i understand thing why whole obamas birth certificate controversy happen being born us requirements president so candidate including obama file shitload paperwork proving born us including birth certificate question shouldnt somebody fbi check papers authenticity there is also obamas biography piece in a pamphlet written by a colleague of his for when he used to lecture at chicago claiming that  barack obama the first africanamerican president of the harvard law review was born in kenya and raised in indonesia and hawaii which made it seem like the person who did the biography either didnt even ask obama a question about himself before writing the piece or obama was lying about where he was born its also been accused that obama wrote it himself the reasoning being that many other people using the same publisher report having to have written it all themselves word for wordstill doesnt mean that he was born in kenya just that he lied about it to make for a better story in college he said he was an immigrant for financial aid gop saw that and took it to mean he was not born in the united states youve kind of hit the crux of the issue to me at least obama had already done this by the time hed run its legit to ask someone to prove theyre a citizen in order to run for president obama had already proven this multiple times prior to running for president the birth certificate thing was egregious because he was being asked for more proof and even after it had been provided the questions kept coming about it even though the original question about obamas eligibility wasnt legitimatethats why among other reasons it isnt the same as asking about mitt romneys tax returns i think there are people now who honestly believe that there was a legitimate question about obamas citizenship in  because the question was repeated so much you can be born in any country and become a citizen of the us you cant be born in another country and be president though you mention citizenship this has never been the issue the issue was whether he was born in the us hence the birth certificate issue im not saying i care either way but your constant point of citizenship is irrelevant my question is why does he have a ssn from connecticut when he never lived in connecticut the common answer is it wasnt written well on his paperwork again i could care less but dont be naive gtyou cant be born in another country and be president thoughunless you are a citizen upon birth due to your parents like john mccain who was born in the panama canal zone couldnt care less the reason this is a problem is because he claimed to be an immigrant in college source among others wwwnoquarterusanetblogbarackobamarunningfrombarrysoetorojust google barry soetoro immigration does not affect place if birth and you can immigrate more than once tldr  republicans are retarded  ok this was one of the first links and snopes says that this is false if we insisted on paperwork mccain couldnt have run people born on army bases are exempt he was  born in a panamanian hospital offbase

It isn\u0027t even on the same planet. It\u0027s ridiculous and disgraceful that a Presidential candidate won\u0027t be forthcoming about this kind of basic tax information.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEDIT: 2012-08-07\n\nSo, one thing I\u0027ve noticed come up a lot (aside from agreement, some debate, complaints about how tough it is to be a conservative in /r/politics, STFU, I\u0027m a moron, etc..) is this idea that there\u0027s a law that says you have to provide a birth certificate to run for President. People then start citing the US Constitution. I realized that there are a lot of people who don\u0027t understand how a citizen runs for President, and what\u0027s required to do so.\n\nTo be blunt, there is no law that requires a candidate to provide a birth certificate to run for US President. \n\nFederal elections are governed by the US Constitution, the 1971 Federal Election Campaign Act, and state laws governing ballot access.\n\nYou need to file a Statement of Candidacy form with the FEC, which means you can solicit funds. Here\u0027s a list of everyone who filed with the FEC for 2012 - http://www.fec.gov/press/press2011/presidential_form2nm.shtml\n\nTo appear on a ballot, candidates must file for ballot access in each state, according to their laws. The Federal Election Commission typically keeps a list of filing dates per state. Here\u0027s the list for 2012, which is available online - http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2012/2012pdates.pdf\n\nEach state has its own ballot access laws, which determine who gets to be on the ballots. As of now, every state has their own deadlines for filing to appear on a ballot, and their own rules. This is because Article I, Section 4, of the United States Constitution leaves the regulation of time, place, and manner of federal elections to the states (unless Congress legislates otherwise). States may have similar rules and paperwork, but they don\u0027t have identical rules (because this is a State\u0027s rights issue).\n\nIn Maryland, for example, the Secretary of State certifies eligibility, and among other things allows the judgement of the Secretary of State to be used to determine whether a candidate is qualified to be on the ballot.\n\nHawaii doesn\u0027t use a primary process. This form is a good indicator of how the process works. Note that candidates need to certify that they are a citizen, a resident of the US for 14 years prior to election, and at least 35 years of age. http://hawaii.gov/elections/factsheets/fsbo123.pdf\nThe one commonality is that typically, the Secretary of State for a given state certifies candidate eligibility.\n\nSo, by law (or by the US Constitution) did any candidate need to produce a birth certificate in the year 2007 or 2008? The answer is no. Unless some poster can point to where in the US Constitution, or in any state ballot access laws, it says that a candidate needs to supply a birth certificate to the Secretary of State of each of the states, there is no law requiring a birth certificate. If the US Constitution was meant to say, \"and candidates prove they are natural citizens by providing a Birth Certificate,\" then it needs to be amended to say so. Or, the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 may need to be amended.\n\nHere\u0027s one such law proposed, but not acted upon, by Rep. Bill Posey \nhttp://www.politico.com/static/PPM119_090313_posey_smith.html\n\nBare in mind that amending the act could become a constitutional issue, since ballot eligibility is supposed to be strictly an issue of states rights.\n\nThat\u0027s how it works. That\u0027s why no candidate needed to provide a Birth Certificate by law, nor do they still. A Secretary of State can certainly ask for one, since ballot eligibility is their responsibility, but that power would vary state to state. But that\u0027s not a legal obligation.\n\nAnyway, just some facts, since a surprising amount of people don\u0027t seem to know how this works.\n\nBarrack Obama did not need to produce a birth certificate to run for office in 2008, and there is NO LAW requiring that anyone do so. It was a bogus thing to ask for during Barrack Obama\u0027s run for President, because he had already been certified to be on the ballots by the time it became a campaign issue.\n\nIf you want that changed, talk to your state representatives, and ask them to change the law.","selftextHTML":"\u0026lt;!-- SC_OFF --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div class\u003d\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We spent nearly 2 years listening to the right demand proof of something that already existed.

eh xd we got red socialists and blue liberals those gay uncle toms log cabin screw pooch colby  every fucking post im remotely surprised with romney anymore romneys arrogance as well antigay supporters completly appaling fact they realize gays world marry whoever they damn well please i raised respect ideals wishes choices gays exception anyone if gays want marry them marry if they want children them children ghostery blocked  trackers site whats up with that not defend romney i despise man arent birth certificates supposed reflect childs biological parentsits social engineering issue medical one after all kid kidney donor organ he require biological parents if biological mother compatible access biological fatherhis mothers partner sue exactly going relevant casesit hurt sues feelings but kids birth certificate sue its child he want what genetic diseases hes predisposed to or male member suffered heart disease and day want who biological father is not medical reasons either he normal human curiosity origins he curious where smile who donated mannerisms who paternal ancestors  years beforesue irrelevant issuessoother than trying social engineering projects sue feel better herselftheres logical reason list birth certificate childs parent by means marriage certificate if thats what wants but listing birth certificate dishonest renders great disservice child as seeks blot actual biological origins how fair himsue feels insecure you your originsseems unbelievably selfish untrue birth certificates in cases of adoption are usually amended to show only the adoptive parents as such gay parents should be on the bc and not the donorsurrogate google it talk to a lawyer or talk to people whove been adopted i live in canada i had to have my birth certificate redone because all i had was a baptism certificate for whatever reason my only birth certificate shows my adoptive parents not biologicalim  if i knew how to get into contact with my biological parents i would have tried by now they do not show biological parents in all cases a woman and the man she is married to will show up on a birth certificate even if the biological father is not that man this will be corrected if the husband signs paternity papers or it is resolved in court  hmmm i am adopted my biological parents have no place on my birth certificate do you feel the same way about a woman who remarries while pregnant  should the biological father be on the birth certificate  what if a child is adopted  should the biological parents be on the birth certificatethe law right now allows the actual parents who quite often arent the genetic parents to be on the birth certificate i guess its how you define the term actual i know that legal definitions depart quite wildly from dictionary definitions like the terms person or corporation have legal meanings quite different from what people commonly assumeso leaving aside legal definitions of what actual parents means the scientific biochemical understanding of the term would align with a childs biological parents ie the two human beings who created him by donating dnalike if i say i have an actual diamond the common understanding of that term is that the diamond is in fact real authentic etc if i have a cubic zirconia and its acting in place of a diamond no one will accept it as an actual diamondso something standing in place of the real thing is not the actual thingbiological parentsliterallyare the actual parents a mothers gay partner would in any scientific forensic sense be a surrogate parent a standin a proxyshe can act in the capacity of a parent but shes not the childs actual parentno more than a cubic zirconia is an actual diamondthat being said i have no problem listing a gay partner somewhere on the birth certificate    as long as theres a record of the childs biological parents since its a medical issue its in societys best interests to give all the information to a human being as possible people are really at a disadvantage if they develop a condition based on a genetic defect or have some recessive gene for say albinism and would like to know that before marrying or if they are predisposed to certain forms of cancer etcto deprive a child of the knowledge of their background is akin to child endangerment youre depriving him of medical knowledge about himself and his genes we make a lot about reproductive rights and we think of women well other people have rights too childrenits a basic human right to have access to knowledge about your origins to have a sense of your ancestry your forbears your identitychildren of gay couples are no different from people who had been adopted as kids it doesnt take anything away from the love they have for the people who raised them but they get curious about where they got their chin or who donated the curve of their eyes or why they have red hair and not brown people love the parents who raised them but that doesnt mean that they dont want to know if theyre say ethnically irish and can be proud of st pattys day or if theyre ethnically jewish and have to beware of tay sachs disease when breeding or partafrican and need to worry about sickle cell anemiaits a reproductive right a basic human right knowing where you came from you feeling that birth certificates should only hold the names of the biological parents has nothing to do with the offense at hand it is already established practice in this country for the birth certificate to hold the names of the people raising a child in fact i would argue that it would be nearly impossible to enforce a true biological birth certificate in many cases who is the father who were the mother and father of this child abandoned at a safe haven facility so whether or not you feel that its a basic human right to know where you came from thats not the function of a birth certificate in this country back to the point at hand romney was arbitrarily making it more difficult for gay adoptive parents to get the same documents amended that every adoptive parent is able to get thats fucked because it singles out gay people even though they are legally wed and legal adoptive parents just because romney doesnt like them   youre preaching to the choir i think romneys a dickmy only point is this when birth certificates were started they were meant to establish paternity to determine exactly where a child biologically forensically came from thats why the slots said mother and father it didnt say genderindeterminate person who would raise the childanyone could raise a child an orphanage can raise a child an aunt can raise a child but that doesnt make them the mother or the fatherthe identities of the mother and father were asked for because biological origins were being asked for and establishedand you make a point about waifs left on doorsteps for whom paternity is impossible to establish its a good point but you should be careful of arguing according to exceptionstotherule that path leads to insufferable polemics by people who for instance take exception to the statement that human beings have ten fingers oh yeah oh yeah then what about people who are born with six fingers on each hand they exist see i debunked your whole ridiculous stereotype that humans have ten fingersbut statistically humans do have ten fingersjust as statistically  of people born will not be waifs left on doorstepsso you cant determine the fate of the  based on the thats irrational and intellectually dishonestbirth certificates whether we like it or not really did come about as a means of authenticating a persons biological originsnow that may be changing and thats fine    as long as we as a society work out these shifting definitions and responsibilities like in a case that made the news a lesbian wanted sperm so that she and her partner could be parents the two women promised the man that he would have no financial liability if he helped them but then the women broke up and the childs biological mother sued the spermdonor for child support it went to court and the judge ruled that since he was the childs biological parent no matter what agreement he thought he had with the lesbians he still had to pay mind you the lesbian expartner didnt but the biological father didso do biological parents have rights or dont they do they have responsibilities or dont theywe pay lots of lipservice to gay domestic partners but when it comes right down to it they can leave and have no further connection to a child the biological parent however doesnt get off that easily when gay parents achieve the same rights as straight parents issues like the one above a case where an expartner could abandon a child with no repercussions would be resolved when they have equal rights theyll also have equal responsibilities it seems like youre holding the fact that gay parents dont have equal rights across the board against them using it as an argument to further deny them said rights its circular logic im not asking to deny anyone any rightsim saying thatas with the abortion issuewe operate a lot of doublestandards with abortion for instance we say that human beings dont exist until they hit the air after birth thats fine    until a drunk driver kills a pregnant woman and suddenly the fetus is considered to exist and the driver can be charged with two murdersso if a mother has an abortion and terminates the life of a fetus its said not to existif a drunk driver terminates the life of a fetus suddenly its supposed to existits a doublestandard we as a society havent decided once and for all if a human being exists legally before its birth we shift the definitions according to whatever mood were inlikewise with gay parents as i said we pay a lot of lipservice to how much they mean how they eclipse the lowly spermdonor how theyre much more important then the two gay people split up and magically the gay expartner has no responsibilities to the childits like they magically never existedthe biological parent though oops you get stuck with the bill while the gay parent gets to melt into the backgroundits not the gay parent who gets the short end of the stick they get to have their cake and eat it too if they want to be the parent we all grant them that right but if they suddenly change their mind theyre allowed to split with little or no repercussionsits the biological parent who actually has no rights its the biological parent whos discriminated against and stuck with the bill he has no say in the matter whatsoever if he wants to have an influence in the childs life oops sorry screw you you get no say but when it comes time to stick people with child support suddenly he has no choice but to pay ithe has no rights and all the responsibilities it all comes down to reproductive rights men have none period some advice on your writing stylewhen you churn out massive

 mitt romney has attacked the obama administrations regulation requiring employers and insurers to provide reproductive health care services  including contraception  by arguing that the rule is undermining the religious liberties of catholics and imposing a secular vision on americans who believe that they should not have their religious freedom taken away as thinkprogress has reported romneys newfound sensitivities contradict his record as governor of massachusetts  where he accepted a very similar contraception equity law  and his previous public commitments to increasing public funding for birth control in  romney even asked the massachusetts department of health to issue regulations requiring all hospitals to issue emergency contraception to rape victims without providing an exception for catholic hospitals now an examination of romneys financial investments reveals that the very same gop frontrunner who is now petitioning the white house to extend the regulations conscience clause and exclude more women from the benefits of birth control is himself invested in and profiting from pharmaceutical companies that produce the frequently prescribed and extremely common medication romneys goldman sachs  exchange place fund valued at over a million dollars in  brought in nearly  in gains in  and is invested in  watson pharmaceuticals manufacturer of nine forms of emergency contraception which romney incorrectly identifies as abortifacients  johnson  johnson launched the first us prescription birth control product in  and produces various forms of birth control  merck produces various forms of birth control  mylan produces birth control medication and filed the first application for a generic birth control pill last year  pfizer a contraception producer that recently had to recall about a million packs of birthcontrol pills that werent packaged correctly romney often disclaims any responsibility for or knowledge of his own investments by claiming that they are held in a private trust but since filing his legallyrequired public financial disclosure reports and certifying that the information is true complete and correct to the best of his knowledge the trust ceased to be a blind trust as he knew what was in it romney signed such disclosure forms last august and during his unsuccessful  presidential bid in august ","commentContent":"this dumb he invested fund trust until blind trust even wasnt blind trust funds set up money managers investments sorts industries you pick what you want you invest funds their performance i stand romney trash i hate to play the liberal advocate but didnt mitt romney argue against blind trusts earlier and how you should know what you are investing in if this is true then the story should be about that not about the fact that a politician is invested in a very small way in companies that just so happen to manufacture a drug that goes against his political ideology again i havent read that he was against blind trusts which wouldnt make sense since his financial dealings have been blind to him for quite some time for just this reason i still cant understand how shit like this gets upvotes  such mindless garbage  thinkprogress  more like think about stupid useless shit did you companies he invested abortions r us baby burgers stars would recommend he exchange place fund not selective investments companies these large stable investments article tldr  dumb i think the point is that if he suddenly thinks bc is evil or murder maybe he should select his individual investments andor ask his broker to make sure he isnt investing in such heathen industries to say he cant hold to his ridiculous religious posturing and continue to make as much money as he has is kind of the whole issue many of us are tired of hearing how things arent wrong so long as they are under the auspices of business and people are making money agreed this is so stupid i have investments in several funds as do many americans with ks and i would wager that most of them have no idea what specific companies commodities etc those funds include and someone with romneys portfolio is bound to be invested somewhat in nearly every sector of the economy  if brazzers went public hed probably have some of that as well  im not hating on romney either for the same reasons mentioned but its not impossible to know where your investments are going i know some endowments for example dont invest in tobacco and make a point to only invest responsibly  well you also arent running for president and if you believe that the morning after pill is immoral then you should investigate your own investments just because many people are hypocrites that doesnt negate the hypocrisy  really  im as antiromney as any other damlibrul on here but almost no one tracks their funds that closely  the whole reason to invest with a fund is that they make the choices so you dont have to im not a liberal again just because almost everyone does something that doesnt make it ok that sentiment is what led to the housing crisis enron etc so if you feel strongly that certain types of birth control are immoral you shouldnt be funding the companies that produce them if its too hard to track then that suggests a problem with the system itself and if you choose to profit from that system despite its flaws you have compromised your beliefs im just trying to go a little deeper than thinking almost no one tracks their funds that closely as an excuse  youre right  romney has compromised the beliefs he claims to holdthat said please show me these people who invest in funds knowing absolutely every single stock in the fund and get notified every time their funds buy a new stock  outside of people who invest solely in issuestancebased funds i suspect thats a very small number  should romney not have invested in that fund  probably not but thats pretty far down the list of things romney shouldnt have done just this week lets say he was invested in them directly shouldnt we be happy that he isnt serving his own financial interests via legislation anyway no romney literally spends his entire day hand picking what companies he puts his entire fortune into he bases those decisions solely on political idealsthe fact that shit like this article gets upvoted is proof that college students dont know the first thing about how investing works if you really know how investing works then you know it is a bullshit system to begin with so romney worked hard for his money and investing is genius and capital gains should be taxed at a low rate blah blah blahbut when it comes to issues like this  romney doesnt hand pick what companies he spends his entire fortune on interestingthe easy way out is to say all you college kids are idiots and you dont know anything about investing usually the one with the dismissive point of view is the one who knows the least about a subjectat least you are honest about his ideals being purely political  i romney silly try use him this ammo argument candidate supporting nazi bornsupportive companies  vw birthed germany nazis hugo clothiers designed nazi uniform ibm sold nazis counting machines count concentration camp peopleif romney invested companies argue hes nazi sympathizer so you are saying we should open lawsuits against romney because that is what happened with both hugo and ibm who as i understand still pay reparations for wwiithe volkswagen beetle was commissioned by hitler himself and designed by porsche but volkswagen after the war only existed because british soldiers saw potential and produced cars for the british army after wwii the volkswagen beetle retained little to do with the nazis besides having the manufacturing plant located in wolfsburg germanytldr the british army should be taken to court for nazi war crimes i was using as comparison its pointless to argue that romney is invested in companies that sell birth control when hes against it im merely saying we could also say that as well if we wanted to make another news article pro life  anti contraceptionwhat there talk herealso investing companies opposes problem if invested companies went with platform youd call corruption i take evidence reddit complain they like facts damned romney ultimate scumbag hypocrite he used health care order garner scumbagvotes turned will prevent fathering robot children he invests them birth control fucking thing they do he opposes birth control catholic vote clearly couldnt personally care less this called hedging your bets its what does its gop hypocrisy being you buckets money investing supporting itsantorum tons money lube company investmentsno news here move along move along romney claims biggest prolife candidate hes investing birth control companies hey that is what the title says newsflash meh his hand was kind of forced on this one if we didnt just have two parties with weird amalgamations of people and instead had a bunch of political parties romney wouldnt even use this as a talking point the issue is that a lot of people give a shit about this stuff just look at how santorum kicked butt in the last primary  precisely  romney needs to get some fundie support both to survive the primary and to have a base for the general  as a mormon he comes into that particular group with  strikes against him so its hardly shocking to see him go for an easy pitch the reagan coalition put all this in motion getting evangelicals and other religious christians traditionally democrats or independents with little focus on or concern for politics who voted on social issues to join the republicans by ceding issue like conservative family values a stance against abortion and more support for religion in schools or homeschoolingschool alternatives romney in mass really didnt give a shit about stopping abortion or birth control but now he has to play ball with the whackos the reason people are skeptical of him is exactly what youre saying  people dont trust mormons and  he is courting conservative christians in a way that feels calculated and dishonest he doesnt speak their language and he cant resonate the way even bill clinton could santorum is earnest in his hatred of abortion and despite all his corruption he seems to be less slimy or clever to the average conservative viewer  the real problem is that everything romney does feels calculated and dishonest well except for the gaffes  the only thing ive ever heard romney say that i think he actually believes is im not concerned about the very poor hah its only a problem for him

make it an issue then we should make it an issue  lets see it mitt  also what about his religion  if people want to call obama a secret muslim socialist which makes no fucking sense then what about this weird polygamist religion that mitt wont talk aboutwe really need to question mitts lack of character especially since everything seems to be off limits gt mitts sidebehold the problem with politics and rpolitics why is that phrasing a problem  donald trump is one of romneys biggest fundraisers and is a notorious birther  arizonas secretary of state ken bennett threatened to leave obama off the ballot if he didnt produce his birth certificate  oh and by the way hes cochair of romneys arizona campaignwould the mitt romney campaign have been a better way to put it its not the phrasing its the collectivist attitude of partisanship campaigns have a collectivist attitude by definition my whole point i agree thats why i said behold the problem with politics and rpolitics im starting to lose your point then  do you think that the problem is that birtherism is a pervasive issue in the mitt romney campaign or do you think that the problem is other people are calling them out on it get over it  political shangri la doesnt exist    nor did i claim it does murderfree society doesnt exist either but i will continue to speak out against murder ok whelp thats the reality  if one side plays by a different set of rules or no rules gt one sidethere it is again i think youre the first guy ive come to really like in rpolitics i am a pretty great guy but how could you tell just from that one comment  the fact youre speaking out against partisan ideologies and practices  if there were more people like you in the legislature our public policy wouldnt suck intentional i know that partisanship is intentional that doesnt make it good so you support people like the kochs libertarians that are buying the elections  dont even try to tell me its equal from the other side gtthere it is againthere itis again incorrect again please tell me where you saw me argue that a compromise between the two political parties is preferable to either party gtincorrect again please tell me where you saw me argue that a compromise between the two political parties is preferable to either partyincorrect again please tell me where you saw me say i saw you argue that a compromise between the two political parties is preferable to either party a small but vocal portion of the other team acting like assholes gives us a license to act like assholes when dealing with anyone on the other team even when they arent part of the original vocal minority focusing on the worst of the other team and applying their behavior to the entire team means we dont have to think critically about anything its very liberating  well trump was in the running for the nomination is that really a small part  are you serioustrump was never in the running he was in some debates in  and never even announced an intention to run it was a fucking publicity stunt  gt    mitts sidegtbehold the problem with politics and rpoliticsbehold the problem with the middle ground fallacyand rpolitics never once did i argue that some average of the two major political parties is better gtnever once did i argue that some average of the two major political parties is betternever once did i argue that you argued that some average of the two major political parties is better in subtraction to never having argued that one party was better than the other neither did he argue that some compromise moderation or middle ground was preferable so shut up gtan individual demonstrating this false compromise fallacy implies that the positions being considered represent extremes of a continuum of opinions and that such extremes are always wrong yes you did you claimed that my comment contained a middle ground fallacy ok  then clarify what you meant by saying the problem with politics and rpolitics is mits side and one sidethanks in advance for the clarification and apologies for my embarrassing lack of charity obama is an atheist muslim kenyan son of a hitler he planned  the phrase youre looking for is race to the bottom its not polygamist religions that im worried about its the polygotists that are the real scurge of america huh  polygonists crap forgot an ltounge in cheek fail damn straight them folks with corners are all real shifty characters what the fuck is wrong with you what a twat yeah  my point  this how i feel about obamas birth certifiacte  and i can post his too  ya dumb dildo by his own admission and according to official records john mccain was born in panama  i dont recollect anyone especially on the right shitting a brick over thatwhenever things like this come up i wonder what my attentions being distracted from accept the stupidity of the average american then realize half the people you see everyday are dumber than that   truly accept this fact and then your daytoday fucks given will approach absolute zero i wish the restriction on having to be born in the us or naturalborn to be president would get altered the current format of this requirement in our constitution automatically removes any chances for someone that moved here a week after being born for example just because they werent born to parents that were already citizensjust keeping the stipulation of having to live in the us for  years plus be a citizen but removing the naturalborn requirement sounds reasonable to meedited for some wording the people who colonized the us all had experience with being ruled by people from other countries englands current royal family are germans i think that this sort of thing was what they were trying to avoid with that clause i can certainly understand that but as i should have specified in my original comment im not saying allow someone thats been here just a few years to do it i agree with stinebot i would say make it a pretty long time after becoming a citizen though im not sure if a full  years is necessary we would obviously want someone that seems committed to the country and staying around for a while and getting citizenship is at least some indication the republican party might actually push for this if they lose to obama because they might decide that schwarzenegger is the only republican that stands a real chance of winningi have no idea if he would make a good or bad president but i think if he ran he could get elected almost solely based on his celebrity status oh cool are you from the past  here in the s schwarzenegger is a failed former governor who was plagued with ethics violations and knocked up his maid and falsified the kids birth certificate  he could get the republican nomination but mainstream america tends to frown on stuff like that just one problemgtthe current lawits not a law  its in the constitution  so it would require a constitutional amendment to overturn it quite true perhaps its time i edited my original post for clarity on some things but just because its in the constitution doesnt mean it cant be changed im gonna repeat to you what an old guy told me once and this guy was  seriousits mainly because we dont want a foreign power to raise a brainwashed commie and pushing him as president of the us if a commie brainwashed by a foreign power somehow actually managed to get elected potus then id say america deserves everything it gets out of the relationship uh wow im pretty sure that could still happen with someone that was born here actually the restriction doesnt require you be born in the us just be a naturalborn citizen  the proof of this is one george romney mitts father  he was born in mexico but he was able to run for president and there wasnt a huge birther fuss about it you are quite correct i obviously should have been more specific i still feel that requirement is too much however because my original example can still fit if someone was born in london to parents that are citizens of great britain but then they all moved to the united states a week later the child and parents have no chance of becoming president which i personally find ridiculous also john born in panama mccain  agreed land of the free but you cant be president because as an infant you may have became antiamerican and vowed revenge   not trump romney thinks this will get him the voted of retards he wants them all they are not stupid people they know what they are doing in a close election any vote is important they can just steal so many gtis anyone else tried of this birth certificate feud nolet both of them produce their original birth certificates why as americans would we not demand thiswhile were at it lets have them produce their college transcripts financial aid forms to see if they claimed they were kenyan or mexican on those and the rest of their paper trailstransparency is good yeasunlight is the best disinfectant yeawhat are you people afraid of findingthe real question of course is whether latinos will vote for the man with an actual hispanic heritage  or the black guy who wants the hispanic george zimmerman lynched um fleeing your country to marry multiple wives does not make one hispanic i thought you guys were for equal marriage rights for allguess not bunch of racists not sure if trolling or stupidi guess ill do you the honor of assuming youre stupid  as a matter of fact i am in favor of marriage rights for all i see no problem with consenting adults marrying as many or as few people as they please either in series the limbaugh plan or in parallel the romney plan whether their ancestors were from europe africa asia or the americas  i am against hypocrisy when people who marry multiple or single partners of their own choosing then claim they are against other people doing the same thing because they are concerned with the sanctity of marriage mitt romney does not advocate polygamyby the way although he personally thinks gay marriage is kind of neato barack obama has said that he believes states should be able to outlaw gay marriage  that its not a civil right so since youre against hypocrisy you should be against obamabut youre notbecause youre not really against hypocrisy you just say that on the internetyoure for obama no matter how much of a hypocrite he is because you have no values havent been watching the news this year huh dipshit why yes yes i have agree the qualifications for the office of the president are xyz establish that you meet them thats pretty basic what does a college transcript financial aid form or the rest of the paper trails have to do with showing eligibility i dont know about tired but its plain to see that a lot of folks are definitely bitter about it for some reason even though we valid birth certificate hand there we round up posse send them michigan confirm reconfirm this is a case for sheriff joe  i hate that my state has become the butt of so many deserved jokes i live in colorado and quite frankly arizona is not our most embarrassing neighbor that honor falls to kansas land of the redneck home of the bornagain christian hooligan  agreed  and i am from kansas well just the corners touch so you arent our real neighbor anyways back up me up utah kansas  the state of a million antiabortion billboards i dont know which is worse those or the ever present antimeth billboards id take a picture of a methhead over an aborted fetus any day that makes me feel a little better only a little though you know you could stop reelecting that particular joke as though i havent tried that already lol i dont know how he keeps winning you know there are  counties other than maricopa we dont all get to vote for or against him michigan anyonechirp chirp chirp shouldnt we be inspecting his marriage licenses instead wait i thought real mittens i read this and was like willard surely you mean mittens romney to fair mitt explicitly stated believes obama born us he trying claim us citizen actively distanced trumps ridiculous claims romney certainly did not shy away from going to trumps fundraiser for him in the last week or so and standing with him and shaking his hand for the photo op hes a huge contributor to the republican party it would be political suicide straight after securing the nomination to publicly cross one of their main backers i would only have a problem with him going to trumps fundraiser if he implicitly accepted the birther issue by not commenting on it but he has explicitly rejected it romney is actively distancing himself from people that are pursuing the birther claimunless theyve got money  obama is actively distancing himself from wall streetexcept while its giving him money obama has actively distanced himself from most of the us citizens and further distanced himself from the us constitution how dare you speak of the one in that manner you bite your tongue when did he distance he said there should be slightly tighter controls on a variety of institutions themselves and the what uses that certain caches of capital can be used for quite similar to mitt romneys approach to the birther issue that makes no sense in the context of my post sorry getting the photo op endorsement from crazy will hurt him in the polls with the independents   if he wants us to see him as a leader that people believe is in charge then at some point he will have to demonstrate his ability to not pander to those that are financing his campaignif he does not have the strength to publicly rebuke one of his financial backers for lying and distracting his campaign with inconsequential drivel how will he be able to summon up enough courage to be leader of the united statesat what point will it not be suicide to stand up to the conspiracy theorists and fringes of his party just because they paid for his campaign  mitt would never do such a thing gentlemen simply do not make such accusations against each otherthats what superpacs are for there is a big difference between not making accusations and directly opposing the accusation itself to directly oppose the accusation would be a denial of the first amendment right that donald trump and others have with respect to free speech  it is sufficient on the part of romney to state that he doesnt himself question obamas birth just like obama has never directly opposed rev wright obama did fire van jones because him name was on a petition calling for another  investigation and i dont imagine that if any big obama backer came out as a truther that obama would show up at their fundraising party  gtand actively distanced himself from trumps ridiculous claimsyour definition of actively seems to be very weirdand wrong gtromney contends that obama is born in the us despite the claims by trump and other extreme republicansby actively refuting the birther claim romney is actively distancing himself from trumps ridiculous claim not from trump himself from trumps claim again  i said it somewhere else  what you are doing is splitting hairs and it makes you look dumbim done here seems like youre the one tht is being dumb no where in the post you responded to does it say that romney is distancing himself from trump only that he is distancing himself from his claim you can disagree with people and still be friendly with them  its not no where its nowhere  one word you dont understand the point what i am saying is that by being close to trump by going to his dinners by being friendly with him  you are tacitly supporting him and his claims  thats how shit works  its guilt by associationhow do you not understand this  regardless of what claims romney or anyone else makes  if your ass is next to someone that claims obama is not born in this country you give your support to that claim  that you are too stupid to understand this doesnt change the fact so much anger i might agree with you if romney just sat silently there and acted like he supported it but he didnt he came out and said he did not support it like i said being friendly with someone does not mean you support everything they do or say  gtso much angeryou think im angry because i called you names hahahagti might agree with you please  i need this validation without it i am lostgtlike i said being friendly with someone does not mean you support everything they do or say well you are an idiot so what you say has as much value aswhat my dog saysthis is the same exact situation with obama and that reverandall he did was go to the church yet that didnt stop people from linking the two willard was drooling all over trump last night do you live in a cave as i said he distanced himself from trumps ridiculous claims not from trump splitting hairs like this makes you look foolish ron paul was the only goper to tell trump to go fuck himself onlyi can name  others  should i produce the quotes or would you rather admit you just liededit guess its easier to downvote than have a conversation involving facts ehfor the record paul hunstman and johnson and even the scumbag roemer all denounced trump   but yeah hero worship lets you forget the facts like that yes protip only one of those men went on to be a nominee for a party and it isnt paul and where is ron pauls nomination as i said to someone else it would be political suicide to do anything but embrace trump given that he is one of the main contributors to the gop im just pointing out the fact that willard is a spineless empty suit thats unfit for office and  those dorothy are the perfect qualifications for potus wasnt mitt born mexico father willard might be an anchor baby his father a mexican eh he better keep his passport on him in az then does that make willard an anchor baby he took our jobs it gets deeper then that his father was part of a group of polygamous mormons that would fight cartels down in mexico hopefully it blows up huge in the upcoming months i havent seen a convincing birth certificate yet his dad funny story his dad did try to run for office and was questioned about his natural citizenship  mitt is mexican the name mitt actually means mexican in spanish i heard it on the radio you really think someone would do that just go on the radio and te wait  i heard hes planet kolob so say we all so sayeth the hivemind what the frak we talking about you are not one of usone of uslook up mormonism and some of its beliefs in fact just google kolob and mormon together woooossshi dont think you got whaddaulookinats reference at all its not about kolob or mormonism a mormon wrote the show battlestar galactica which was heavily influenced by his beliefs in the story humans formed  colonies in a star system after their home world kobol real clever guy was destroyed by robots the saying so say we all comes from the show oh  sake really you can say cats this is the internet afterall  only rpolitics would front page no itd also get high up

signature lineup of contributors president naral in light of recent events on the presidential campaign trail id like to reintroduce former massachusetts gov mitt romney to a politician for whom attacking contraception is an alltoo usual topichis name is mitt romney gov romney who has taken a commanding lead in polls seemed flabbergasted to be asked a question at saturdays gop presidential debate about the right to contraception he called it an unusual topic and said that he cant imagine a state banning contraception an unusual topic i wish i could say it was even though  percent of american women use birth control at some point in their lives attacking the right to contraception has become anything but unusual for antichoice politicians including romney lets take a moment to review the facts as governor romney vetoed a bill giving rape survivors information about and timely access to emergency contraception fortunately the massachusetts state legislature voted to override romneys veto romney also recently proposed eliminating title x the federal familyplanning program that provides millions of americans with contraception and other basic care gov romney even voiced his support for a state constitutional amendment that would not only outlaw abortionincluding for survivors of rape or incestbut that could also ban many common forms of birth control after voters in mississippi rejected such an amendment romney tried to pretend he hadnt taken such an extreme and outrageous position just a month earlier if this werent evidence enough of his hostility to birth control romney also selected robert bork to serve as the top judicial adviser to his campaign robert bork is most known as the farright judge who was rejected by a bipartisan majority of senators from serving on the us supreme court because of his extreme views against civil rights equal protection for women under the constitution a womans right to choose and even the right to use birth control you get the picture when it comes to womens right to birth control gov romney is far outside the american mainstream unfortunately many antichoice politicians throughout the nation share his misguided priorities npr and the new york times have reported on howpossibly for the first time in decadesopposition to birth control has become an acceptable position for candidates in the republican primaries and its not limited to politicians at the national level last summer new hampshires executive council voted to reject a contract with planned parenthood forcing the states six clinics to stop providing birth control one new hampshire councilor raymond wieczorek summed up his thoughts on women who use contraception if they want to have a good time why not let them pay for it fortunately new hampshire has a prochoice senator jeanne shaheen who worked with the obama administration to secure federal funding to keep the health centers open and when states from indiana to texas tried to limit lowincome womens access to birth control the obama administration said not so fast president obamas landmark healthcare law also makes nocost birth control possible for most american women one in three women currently struggles with the high cost of birth control gov romney says the healthcare lawincluding the nocost birthcontrol policymust be repealed maybe gov romney cant imagine a state banning contraception but he should know that his own positions would put birth control out of reach for millions of american women no birth control is not an unusual topic womens right to contraception is very much at stake in this electionand thats because antichoice politicians like romney have made a point of attacking it paid for by naral prochoice america wwwprochoiceamericaorg

based onromney has supreme court  supreme court decided states provide contraception istephanopoulos yes they have in  griswold v connecticutromney the  i  law land spoken supreme court we disagree with supreme court  occasionally i  we process under constitution change decision and its  its amendment processand  where we  instance were issues relate samesex marriage my view is we federal amendment constitution defining marriage relationship man woman but i  reason talk contraception regardstephanopoulos but youve supreme court decision finding privacy constitutionromney i dont they decided correctly in view roe v wade improperly decided it based upon principle and view we justices roberts alito thomas scalia justices that they well decide return issue states opposed its federal constitutionand way people federal constitution unelected judges stuff there when its there we allow people express their views through amendment add constitution but idea justicestephanopoulos but caseromney pardonstephanopoulos should caseromney should case  case allow states ban contraception no states dont want ban contraception so why would we try constitutionwith gay marriage ive told you thats when i would amend constitution contraception its working fine leave alone thats some evasive questionnotanswering there  contraception limits are the bigger issue in my opinion  sure you can get contraception but only if you have a signed permission slip from your mother grandmother and a practicing priestthe mention of amending the constitution to insure marriage inequality is the much bigger concern to me  that he tries to claim that popular vote should be deciding civil rights issues makes it clear that hes just pandering and cant actually believe what hes saying in a way im glad that the right has started pushing this idea of a constitutional amendment to prohibit samesex marriage for two reasons while i strongly disagree with their goal here i have to admit that this is at least the legally and technically correct way to try to accomplish it so i can give them some credit for that its a lot more honest than trying to backhandedly undermine the constitution with bullshit laws like doma the chances of any constitutional amendment passing much less one as controversial as this are very small that means that any serious effort to try to pass this amendment will almost certainly fail and that may well end up creating a legal and political precedent that will pave the way for greater acceptance of samesex marriage except that the amendment isnt being pushed honestly  the idea of it is used as a tool to get a certain group of voters to the polls to vote for it either directly or to vote for the candidate who will support it  after major elections it almost never gets mentioned again because it is such a stupid idea  it would never happen and should never happen  it isnt like it is new  theyve used it repeatedly now to energize the subset of voters who care more about preventing people from getting married of course he would evade the questionif he says yes they have the right to ban contraception then you get stupid articles like this one which completely misrepresent him as trying to ban contraceptionif he says no states dont have the right to ban contraception he alienates all those of us who believe in strict constructionism and federalism and further portrays himself as a really shitty conservativethe question was fucking stupid and the only person who was in the wrong here was stephanopolos i agree it wasnt a very good question but it was effective at making romney think about and respond to something in a slightly less than completely canned mannerthats about as good as most of these debates seem to offer  a better question would have been about limits on contraception which is a very real issue  i think stephanopolos might have meant to go in that direction and he failed who cares about stupid articles from biased sources the point is if a state tries to ban contraceptives which one has in the past are they acting within their constitutional obligations if they are not you have to find where they are in fault of the constitution the supreme court found that they were at fault because of an inherent right to privacy if they were mistaken about an inherent right to privacy which roe v wade is based on then this ruling can be overturned along with roe v wadeso it goes if your argument is that there is no inherent right to privacy in the constitution and therefor roe v wade should be overturned then so should griswold v connecticut so using griswold v connecticut as a framing device for what the ultimate causality of that argument means is an excellent question to find out where his ideals really are the obvious is then displayed he has no ideals and will say anything to get elected the issue at hand here is not that of the right to privacy but rather the misinterpretation of the th amendment that has led to the incorporation of the bill of rights for the record im decidedly prochoice but am very much in favor of overturning roe v wade it was a terrible decision strict constructionists want an actual conservative candidate  i would love to see someone call out the precedent of incorporation for what it is  a bunch of antistatesrights bullshit theres no justification when looking at the founders intentions for extending the restrictions imposed upon the federal government by the bor to the states and its an extreme stretch to justify it with the th amendment thats really the issue at hand here  are states bound by the bill of rights or does it apply only to the federal government i dont think anyone could find a constitutional justification for the banning of contraception on a national level however there really is no unconstitutionality to a state banning contraception from the viewpoint of an originalist interpretation not to say its a good idea  were it to come up in my state id vote against it for sure  but its a states right to do it gtthe obvious is then displayed he has no ideals and will say anything to get electedi dont want a person in office that bases everything off their own opinions they should make decisions based off of public opinion if they run on an idea the public then decided is a bad idea they should change their idea  the public supports the freedom of women to use contraceptives  the minoirty extremists republicans who attend these primaries dont support that freedom  hes not exactly supporting the majority when he caters to his extreme base and tries to cover it up from scrutiny   i dont think its that necessarily more so a large majority has already decided that contraceptive use should not be regulated by the state they reside in but a large majority hasnt decided whether abortion should be regulated by the state though im sure a large majority of his supporters agree that abortion should be able to be regulated by the state they just want someone to tell them why in a constitutional sense but why cant the state do that the only reason that it could not is because it goes against something in the constitution either a freedom given to the people or a power given to the federal government in griswold v connecticut the supreme court ruled that a state could not regulate contraceptives because of an inherit right to privacy because of that ruling the right to privacy has been used as justification in other hearings including roe v wade by attacking roe v wade something the general public has not yet come to a defined consensus on on the basis that there is no right to privacy in the constitution he would also inherently have to agree that the the ruling in griswold v connecticut was wrong something the general public has come to a defined consensus on you wouldnt be able to have it both ways otherwise why he thinks roe v wade needs to be overturned is wrong and thats what that question is trying to point out birth control and abortion are legal because of the constitutional right to privacy mitt is saying that there is no right to privacy in the constitution and that the supreme court was wrong in finding that from the case roe vs wade thats where the problem is they can say oh thats silly theres no chance thatd happen all they want but if they say there is no constitutional right to privacy theyre saying that its perfectly legal to ban abortion and birth control this is the money quotegtromney i dont believe they decided that correctly in my view roe v wade was improperly decided it was based upon that same principle and in my view if we had justices like roberts alito thomas and scalia and more justices like that they might well decide to return this issue to states as opposed to saying its in the federal constitutiongtand by the way if the people say it should be in the federal constitution then instead of having unelected judges stuff it in there when its not there we should allow the people to express their own views through amendment and add it to the constitution but this idea that justicethis is him saying that he wants to appoint antiabortion judges to the supreme court or create a constitutional amendment to overturn roe vs wade so yeah this is what he actually said  as a fyi for all you males out there there are other reasons a women might have to take a birth control pill in fact the way we name them that irks me a little they are not just used to prevent you from having a kid they can also be used lesson the sometimes severe symptoms of that time of the month for some women like myself the symptoms are extremely exaggerated and severe i was put on bc pills long before i ever got serious with a boy banning these forms of contraception out right would make a lot of women suffer every monthand when we suffer youll suffer if the right is successful you wont be busy talking about making guys suffer on reddit  youll be too busy wiping the noses of six kids and hoping that your husband never leaves you womens rates of participation in the workforce continue to increase while mens rates have been decreasing  this means that increasingly it is likely that dad will be at home with the six kids praying his sugar momma never leaves him  stats from a horrible article    heres the thing about mormons we do believe in abortion under certain circumstances  abortion is acceptable in the mormon church when pregnancy is the result of incest or rape when the life or health of the mother is judged by competent medical authority to be in serious jeopardy or when the fetus is known by competent medical authority to have severe defects that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birthso him saying he doesnt agree with roe v wade does not constitute wanting to ban all abortion like palin  he takes a pro life stance because in most cases assuming his ideas are the same as the churchs on that issue he is pro life but that is not to say that he is  anti abortion ok but hes saying the reason that abortion and birth control are legal in the first place does not or should not exist its sort of weaselly to say that you support the choice to have an abortion in cases of rape incest and health but to turn around and say that states should be allowed to ban it  well he didnt say they should ban it  he said he was against the banning of birth control and he didnt say ban abortion per say just that roe v wade was incorrect  idk i know the abortion issue is a big deal for some people but i just feel like it will be many years till we ever reach solid federal laws on it and whoever gets voted in this term probably wont even deal with that issue much as there are much bigger things on the table gtwell he didnt say they should ban it correct he said they should be allowed to ban it knowing that many would and lying when he says that no state would want to ban it  that is basically the same as saying that states should ban it if they want to  not directly mind you he said it in a round about waygti dont believe they decided that correctly in my view roe v wade was improperly decided it was based upon that same principle and in my view if we had justices like roberts alito thomas and scalia and more justices like that they might well decide to return this issue to states as opposed to saying its in the federal constitutionbased on the sentence it is clear that he would appoint supreme court justices likely to overturn roe v wade and which both rest on the same grounds the right to privacy  he doesnt think we have a right to privacy because those cases are what established that we have a right to privacy contained in the constitution  ron paul has the same view as do the rest of the gop  they dont think we have a right to privacy and that is scary to me gtcorrect he said they should be allowed to ban it knowing that many would and lying when he says that no state would want to ban it that is basically the same as saying that states should ban it if they want to not directly mind you he said it in a round about waythis could really come down to a states rights issue  where you draw the line on what laws a state can and cannot make  as was mentioned above he didnt want to say no the state cannot make that law and risk sounding like he wants to limit state powers  you are right though there are certain states that probably would try and ban it i just figure he was looking at it from his perspective in ma that there is no way in hell contraceptives would be banned by the stateim not sure i agree with you on the roe v wade and griswold v connecticut point though i think it should be taken into account that griswold v connecticut was in the s and a lot of views have changed on sex and contraceptives  i have a hard time seeing that decision overturned yes there are a few lunatics that think it should be but i dont think there are enough to make it happen  i could be wrong though i also feel that those cases were won on the grounds of a constitutional right to privacy but i dont feel that they necessarily established it  and again while they are somewhat similar cases in nature i dont know that you could say because one would overturn one they would overturn the otherbut then again thats all just my opinion gt and lying when he says that no state would want to ban itits pretty clear the question and his answer was in regards to common forms of contraceptives including the pill and condoms and its unlikely any state would want to ban it given again the statistic that  of americans use such contraceptivesalso it is certainly plausible that one could be prochoice and procontraceptives but against the jurisprudence of roe v wade though usually this is the sort of nuanced position libertarian law professors like to have not laymen  it comes down to the theory that by taking the abortion issue out of the voters hands before it was appropriate it kickstarted an entire generation of ill feelings toward judicial overreach and the abortion issue by conservatives  the theory goes that if the supreme court had waited a few decades the issue would be as noncontroversial to the public as most other substantive due process cases because most people would simply agree with it  and yes most americans agree that abortions should be allowed for at least the first trimester  it shouldnt be a hot button political issuea famous example is brown v board of education  at the time there were significant swaths of the us that vehemently disagreed with the decision  the supreme court generally aware that it cannot buck democratic trends instructed the states to use all deliberate speed ie take your time in implementing its decision  a decade later basically no progress had been mind on the desegregation front  by then the idea was much more popular and the supreme court felt comfortable simply ordering the school districts to desegregate gtgov romney even voiced his support for a state constitutional amendment that would not only outlaw abortionincluding for survivors of rape or incestbut that could also ban many common forms of birth controlso he is a lying sack of shit  a state wanted to ban birth control and he supported it as govenor  luckily that did not pass and hopefully the supreme court wouldnt let it stand if it did  he knows damn well that many states do want to ban contraception and abortion and he would love to allow them to do it  his whole no state wants to defense is just a smokescreenedit correction it wasnt his state which wanted to pass the ammendment defining life as begining at conception it was a different state but my post still applies read through the huffpo links closely they very carefully craft their wordsit wasnt his state it was mississippis  romney just voiced his support of it  and it wasnt an amendment on common forms of birth control it was on the definition of personhood which would backdoor ban abortion and after the fact birth controls like morning after pills not condoms birth control pills the infallable pullout method etcits an amendement that takes the thinking of most prolifers and builds it in to the constitution  that idea that life begins at conception yes that is the sort of amendment i knew they were talking about like ron pauls sanctity of life act  i didnt realize it wasnt his state but that makes more sense  the point is that states would do that if they were allowed to  defining life as begining at conception does make some oral contraceptives illegal not just the morning after pills  many forms of oral contraceptives allow the egg to fertilize but then cause it to be expelled as part of the menstration cycle  that would be considered murder if a fertilized egg is considered a person clearly your facts all have a strong bias  impressive questioning on the part of stephanopoulosreading romneys answers was like watching a very slow motion train wreck hes clearly being paid to post both parties employ people for the sole purpose of manipulating online communities prior to an election and wb is particularly prolific in that sense not to mention that the mods here look the other way when it comes to enforcing the no editorializing headlines rule for him  thanks for this i cant stand the whole republican field but op is clearly editorializing   the forced childbirth coalition closet the antiabortion crusade coverprobably examined closely we would find white babies eric rudolph openly admitted whats that line people use life begins at conception and ends at birth  that pretty much sums up the anti abortion people agreed if you start looking into the major prolife groups you will find that they are all also anticontraception even though greater contraception use is probably the number one thing that could lead to fewer abortionsthey dont get any respect from me yes one would think that was a contradiction until you realize theyre not really about abortions specifically but are more about forced childbirth and the resultant oppression of women i think its also about punishing people who live differently than they do i just dont think that holds up to reality though if you look at the number of african americans using abortion vs the number of white people choosing abortion there is a big difference if you take into account the large population difference between the two african american abortion rates are significantly higherbanning abortion would just make the number of minorities in this country larger than it already is yes but their perception as is very often the case is not reality what irritates there people who use pill things than contraception im currently looveral i pmdd anxiety attacks tied pmdd when hormones arent problem im perfectly awesome functioning person society also banning contraception abortions will problem edit it wont recreational sex problem theyre concerned will problems sexually active women what is the problem that needs to be fixed really theyd argue some nonsense about sex for nonprocreation purposes being immoral but thats not a problem that needs to fixed sex is fun babies are not babies are both fun and not fun sex is most always fun in my anecdotal experience also im male but sex can also be complicated anyway i know its popular to dismiss we breeders on reddit still some of us love being parents and love our children very much hopefully your parents love you all but i digress of course access to contraceptives should not be limited of course there should be a mechanism for victims of sexual abuse to get abortions without the permission of the parents im not sure how this works in real life but there should be exceptions to parental notification i find it very hard to understand why any woman would support the gop  maybe i should have saidgtsex is fun babies only so under certain conditionsa kid right now would be disastrous for me but one day itd be nice im weird in the notion that i dont want to have kids of my own i dont really ever see myself as having enough money to properly care for one and i just dont have the drive to want one if i wind up married one day and the hubbs does want kids and we can reasonably support one or two then ill probably go for adoption rather than having one of my own  youre fine im just hypersensitive to the hatred directed towards we parents the thing that gets me is that i consider the people of reddit to be generally smarter than the average bear and should be the ones procreating  the fact that millions of women use birthcontrol pills for their hormoneregulating abilities and are collateral damage for the gops anticontraception crusade i edited my comment i apologize for trying to be clear and concise without having my coffee yet  why did you put the problem in quotation marks like that  youre suggesting that premenstrual dysphoric disorder pmdd isnt a problem  lets look at the symptoms shall wedisinterest in daily activities and relationships fatigue or low energy feeling of sadness or hopelessness possible suicidal thoughts feelings of tension or anxiety feeling out of control food cravings or binge eating mood swings marked by periods of teariness panic attack persistent irritability or anger that affects other people physical symptoms such as bloating breast tenderness headaches and joint or muscle pain problems sleeping trouble concentratingand she specifically mentioned anxiety attacks  youre suggesting those arent problems for people  seriously  have you done much research on this subjectthis sounds like simple naturalism like you think that if someone is made a certain way they were meant to be that way and any attempt to change their biochemistry is wrong somehow  which seems goofy to me  you wouldnt say eh i have a broken leg thats not really a problem that needs to be fixed thats just who i am  why is an abnormal hormonal imbalance any different i think youre misinterpreting what melojelo said  she was responding to a comment that ended with also banning contraception and abortions will not fix the problem  what problem is it that banning contraception and abortions wont fix oh  right  failed to see that there were two problems in that postmaybe i need to get on that new prescription pill that makes me read to the end of a post and think for two seconds before responding gtmaybe i need to get on that new prescription pill that makes me read to the end of a post and think for two seconds before respondingtheres currently a ritalin shortage thanks to the dea and pharma corps yeah i typed that before i had my coffee this morning hopefully its fixd now please actually read the article not just the reddit headline they arent talking about banning it but rather not state funding of it the list of things the government funds is long and includes plenty of shit id happily eliminate before tossing some cash at contraception  id argue that readily available contraception is a reasonable investment for the government to be making due to returns and preventing future costnot really directed at you but its a hot button issue for me i actually get my bc through a state funded clinic right now because my insurance wont cover it and im a college student working on minimum wage taking away the funding is still pretty bad personal opinion incomingdo you need the birth control for any purpose other than having sex without worry of pregnancy if it is for a genuine health issue i do see a grey area in regards to state subsidization if it is for sex i dont believe you have any right to expect the state to pay for it i may be selfish but i dont believe i should have to help pay for your ability to have sex without worry of the natural consequences reproduction is still the main reason for sex even if it is awesome dont get me wrong i love it and government funding of recreation falls outside of acceptable usage of public dollars to draw an analogy lets just say that recreational sex is not a necessity of life you can live a functional life without it i like to rock climb its a recreational activity i enjoy if i cannot afford the equipment to go climbing i simply dont do it and no one would ever say well you really enjoy that so the government should really help pay for your equipment so you can go do it i feel the same way about recreational sex if you cannot afford contraceptives dont do it you dont pay for my rock climbing gear im not paying for your sex im still a virgin ive been on the pill for two years now because of my pmdd that causes anxiety attacks which can seriously ruin my day and prevent me from getting my work done i stated that above actually theres a lot of women who do take it to lessen the symptoms of their own pms or for legitimate medical reasons there are a lot of people who dont believe it when we say it either my own father is one of themif my insurance would pay for it i would totally be okay with that however they do not i get it through the state i do get where youre coming from though i used to horseback ride all the time im not right now because i cant pay to use the facilities there are always going to be people who are going to have sex regardless of if they can pay for it or not the issue with recreational sex versus recreational everything else is that it can make a baby im on the side of keeping contraception cheap and easily accessible to keep less kids from being born not that i dont like children a bunch of my friends from high school already have kids that they cant afford because they couldnt get the pills they needed or a condom failed somewhere along the line or they just didnt use anything at all  i understand your situation my own wife took bc for a long time for medical reasons not pmdd but i do believe that hormone therapy can help im behind you there hopefully more can be done to prove it to convince health insurance to cover it or possibly find other hormone therapies to treat your health issues i did not see your comment above but like i said i have no judgement for those who need bc for medical purposes i also am torn due to the issue of unwanted children it really boils down to personal responsibility something weve beaten to death around here if you cant afford bc or a child you shouldnt be having sex of course if everyone were personally accountable for their actions wed have much less to worry about that is a rant for another day best of luck to you thanks i was actually on ssris before this and those were covered by insuranceout of pocket because where i used to live there were issues with giving a minor birth control pre years they worked okay i could only take half a pill because of heightweight issues but they eventually made me stop eating foodwhen i moved to where im living now my docs and i talked about and considered hormone therapy but because im still fairly young and my issues arent considered to be to the point where i would need it we decided that the pill was currently the easiest and most cost effective route for everyone involved and its been working pretty great so far my biggest worry in this issue is that the big guys at the top arent going to pay attention to those of us who do need it for medical and that they wont put in provisions to help us out in the end  let me guess you are a man its easy to dismiss birth control as a luxury when you are not ever going to be in danger of housing the repercussions in your body and for your information sex is a biological need not a recreational activity in fact it is the number one thing we are programmed to do   you contradict yourself in your own post amusingyes sex is a biological need it is the means by which we reproduce you know keep the species going and all you state it is not a recreational activity so then why are you doing it with birth control recreationally if you accept that it is not a recreational activity then you should never do it if your intent is not reproduction therefore you admit birth control is not a necessity and a luxury  youre right no one has ever engaged in a biological need and derived some enjoyment out of it no one has ever eaten anything purely for the enjoyment of it we all solely consume vitaminenhanced veggie protein we all only sleep the bare minimum of hours necessary to function during the day pooping only feels good because the devil made it so to distract you from the bare reality that biological imperatives are cold hard fact and nothing moreall living things are driven to have sex the fact that we enjoy it is not an indication that it is anything less than a biological imperative most biological imperatives are enjoyable as a form of natural encouragement for us to do them your reductive reasoning has failed you my friend youre thinking in circles you dont see the flaw but if you did you wouldnt be trying to promote it if you truly understood the biological imperative youd know that the enjoyability is simply a tool to further the process the need to reproduce it is not there to simply create an enjoyable activity that though is neither here nor there in regards to your original argumentlets talk food for a moment you are aware that there are government programs regarding providing food to those who need it lets look at them we have food stamps and wic both are highly restrictive as to the type of food provided thus the government has seen that if it is going to provide assistance for a biological need it is going to only do what is going to further survival you dont see them subsidizing big macs in that vein of reasoning the government has no responsibility to pay for your sexual enjoyment you will not die if you dont have sex you will not die if you dont eat at mcdonalds  gtgovernment funding of recreation falls outside of acceptable usage of public dollarsi guess youve never been to a government funded park monument or museum rightbesides looking at it from a funding standpoint which would you prefer someone getting cheap birth control pills or someone on the government dole andor sending a kid to public school the phrase penny wise pound foolish springs to mind like i said yes i do understand the idea that by providing contraception we can hopefully keep from having to support children that the person cannot there is some idealistic reasoning i have that if people could simply be responsible with their own actions the need for either wouldnt existnow for public funding for recreation there is a difference public parks are free for all to enjoy they do have a place i think stadiums would be a better analogy i dont agree with public funding something theyll have to pay even more money to get to enjoy whole other rant gtgov romney even voiced his support for a state constitutional amendment that would not only outlaw abortionincluding for survivors of rape or incestbut that could also ban many common forms of birth controlromney did want to ban types of birth control as governor  also santorum has gone out and said he wants to allow states to ban it  ron paul definitely wants to allow states to ban it along with doing whatever the fuck they want states rights rule supreme in pauls ideal world i know what you mean i take birth control for pcos ive tried a few other things but birth control is really what has worked the best and unfortunately there are people who believe that women who dont take it as contraception are just lying to not look like sluts wait birth control and abortions theres gonna be like billion babies i think thats the point  i mean thats what some people who back these types of sentiments want well catholics and many other religious sects including muslims in society seem to believe sex should only be between man and woman therefore extramarital sex between anybody should be prohibited meaning that contraception is not needed because abstinence is used instead then if a married couple is having sex it should only be in order to procreate be fruitful and multiply so using contraception here is to block the divine desire to repopulate the earth ultimately this view is very understandable but also incredibly nave as if you could control the fucking of a billion selforiented intelligent people what the types of individuals that believe this type of ideology want is to control others this is it their morality is not in question since of course they and everyone else they know follows these rules instead they cant handle the fact that other people might not care about the way they view morality so they want to literally force their views on others this is not healthy nor realistic and causes much more harm than good if these people really wanted to make an impact upon others and not just control them theyd do so in unobtrusive ways rather than shouting and belittling this type of reaction should not be allowed for me that viewpoint isnt understandable whether you subscribe to a religion or not since time began people have been having sex in and out of wedlock with members of the same sex with multiple wives with other peoples husbands etc sex is a biological need and isnt just used for procreation you see animals who live on instincts having sex with members of the same gender  they arent doing it to procreate especially the male members of the species  and it isnt always about dominance it is used as a social tool and many primates even use sex as a bartering tactic also physically semen builds up and must be expelled for health reasons im not disagreeing with you completely but i dont believe in giving the uberreligious an out by trying to explain their side they can believe whatever they want and thats fine but they should not be legislating their morality which is exactly what they are trying to do so i guess i agree mostly  just expanding if you deny trying to understand their sides position they will try to fight back if you have someone say no youre wrong instead of well i understand this is what you believe and why you believe it but here is what i believe and why i believe it you are going to get a negative response when what is needed is a positive one i always try to see the other side and i understand what theyre saying i just dont accept it and i dont think it helps society to sit here and make excuses for their asinine beliefs sometimes you can disagree and still say you know what i get where youre coming from these specific beliefs in my humble opinion dont deserve that response from society they may not deserve that recognition but unless they get it theyll continue to be more aggressive and more vocal until we are forced to deal with them i dont understand why they have problems with people having fun and why they want to limit sex to procreation they see that fun as something that taints their soul is it really worth it to have temporal fun if it destroys your potential eternal happiness theyre not the only belief system puttering around to them they are well i think its more that they want people to have to deal with the possibility of considerable consequences if they ever want to be physically intimate with anyone  which is what birth control is for so you can responsibly be physically intimate but theyre more interested in slapping a scarlett letter  in the form of a baby  on people well a lot of fundies just view it as the basic lust sin for them being intimate without wanting to have a baby is just a deadly sin thats why to them birth control is encouraging the sin and thats why they have  kids because they cant stop fucking anyways because fucking is great but they dont want to sin so theyd rather have plenty of kids to show see we fuck a lot but each time weve been trying so that doesnt count right but they dont believe that guns encourage the deadly sin of wrath and cars encourage sloth shhh youre not supposed to talk about the other sins just the ones that they want to see punished god feels both of those hes always pissed about something and he took all of saturday off he doesnt feel lust for anyone especially not rodrigo the pool in heaven just needs cleaning a lot and he wants the help to have as little fabric as possible to get caught in the drains i mean thats normal right i figured this is what my cousin was doing after she had her rd kid in  years and got knocked up again shes on  now i wonder if shes aware that her ohsocatholic mother that im sure she got all this crap from was on birth control her entire life and all  of her kids came from birth control failing not planning it  or it could be even simpler i think they just want more followers of their religion and the children of destitute overworked single mothers are probably easier to rope in than the children of educated people who practice responsible family planning gt the possibility of considerable consequences if they ever want to be physically intimate with anyonei have some friends who would like to say hello they are named s t an d no contraceptive is  effective at reducing their transmission yet we as a species need more punishment for something that is genetically ingrained into our species brilliant yeah because when your  year old teenager forgets to walk the dog what you do is buy them a starving puppy a child is not a consequence its a person people like you are the reason reddit is filled with overly sensitive socially awkward jerkoffs children are not fashion accessories if you treat them like some sort of knock off brand purse theyre going to act a bit weird if you really wanted to punish all of those evil female bitches for having the sex then just make them carry the child until  weeks then force them into an abortion because as evil as that is it sounds better than bringing unplanned unwanted or uncared for children in the world just so you can force women into being housewives before theyre old enough to work  people like me you realize im totally against the fundamentalist view that people should have to deal with the risk of having a child a child is a consequence in that a parent has to pay for that childs needs and wants and take time to care for him and teach him and such people who arent prepared to do this for kids shouldnt have them obviously but for those who view sex as sinful children are the right result and people who choose to commit this sin are supposed to pay for it by having the responsibility of a child forced on them every once in a while or often if youre very fertile an std is a consequence a child is a person  a child is a consequence unless the parents planned for itor possess the resources to care for it doesnt mean the parents cant learn to love it but yeah it is a consequence its not about punishment of anyone its common sense which is why i support extensive access of birth control and abortion if they want it for all a consistent position youre still a dick if you think a child is a consequence and no common sense says babies are cute things that poop a lot and cost money and sleep but they grow into adults i dont understand how people think kids are some different or lesser species other than theyre just a dick  finishing on her face  thats a paddlin which is a problem considering anyone can just have a kid you dont have to get a licence to raise a person thats going to be part of society one day as much as i like some of the republican view points this one here is why i will not vote republican this year dont worry god will take care of things we can just ban childhood vaccinations too then everything will balance out itll be great next theyll make pulling out illegal that should really fix things it might since thats a pretty ineffective method of avoiding pregnancy also not so effective for dealing with stds which is perhaps a little off topic but still worth mentioning  actually its very effective if done properly do some research instead of listening to old wives tales that are supposedly common sensei know more people whove gotten pregnant on the pill than using condomspulling out probably because hardly anyone takes the pill at the same time everyday the trouble with islam is that its full of muslims if we cant get them out well breed them out astute observationcorollary now you know why homosexuality is considered a sin you hit the nail on the head i think its this exact thought that is running through the heads of christian fundamentalists the only way its good for women is if it means all the mens rights assholes kill themselves after learning of all that owed child support wut this is terrible for women and apathetic for most men except for those who feel its their responsibility to take no responsibility in their kid think of all the babies you might have if no woman was on the pill of course no one marries every ex they fuck so unless youve got those kinds of parents the amount of men owing child support will skyrocket most guys dont have a problem with this unless they hate the mother and it leaves all of the responsibility of not getting pregnant with the man too since you either gotta pull out sketchy or use a condom sucky so setting all that up can you see how this may cause a mass suicide of angsty divorcees and their weird uberasskiss wives  cum again gtno birth control and no abortionssounds like brazil where they hunt and kill children for sport and profit it surprising when asked women scientists pill scientific achievement effected their lives most it mark womens liberation they decide

powercow meant affected we all make typos sometimes apparantly im sure of it but when its a funny typo with an ironic meaning that can be turned into a joke im legally obligated to make said jokeif you disrespect the law you disrespect me indeed and that is why you got my upvotealso you seem to have missed my typo and therefore ended typo pun thread i see the typo but what joke would you make off of it  what ironic alternate meaning does it give the sentence no answer  yeah figured it went right over your head a lot of them arent against all birth control just the plan b pill since it can act as a chemical abortion  it depends on when you think a fetus becomes a person nope this is not how the plan b pill works  it does nothing if the egg has already implanted but they think unimplanted blastocysts have a right to life yes those dark ages where moms actually raised their childrenwe sure have come a long way from prehistoric times where the family was important part of life and a mans salary could support his family gta mans salary could support his familysorry but part of equality is having to work too  and the problem with salaries being low has everything to do with the rising income inequality we have had for the past  decades  the rich are stealing all the wealth of the nation leaving the middle class with nothing   of the country has a smaller share of the income than they did  years ago while the share of the top  skyrockets  many more people could support a familly on one income if the income inequality was what it was in  raising a family is work  important work imoeverything else i agree with you about  i think the two issues are related being a good mother and having a job are not mutually exclusive staying home wont make you a good mother eitherspending  hoursweek away from home does not help gtspending  hoursweek away from home does not helpsays who if the kids are at school for most of that time anyway does it really make that much of a difference plenty of people became fully functioning adults even with both parents working full time or being raised by a single parent i dont disagree that family is important and our society has put less focus on it recently but having a parent at home full time is not a necessity if we put more focus on giving people livable wages without insane work weeks it would be easier for both parents to work and be more involved with parenting youre imagining that the world was always how it was in the s this is totally not the case overwhelmingly throughout history bothall adults of a family would work unless they were very rich there were no stayathome parents because everyone was needed in the fields and on the farm to help bring in food and money for the familys wellbeing romanticising middle of the th century and pretending it is the best way to be is idiotic and ignorant the world needs more stayathome husbands what people fail understand birth control pill used than birth control my wife used use severe mood swings pain outofcontrol menstrual cycles i dont understand phrase you pregnant you dont want be citizen earth realize antichoice nonsense i thats essentially what boils to not really actually its more you can get pregnant and should take responsibility when you donow im not saying im against the use of contraception but i am against abortion unless the mother is at risk of death so if you get pregnant by accident or if youre uneducated about birth control thats what chicken shit i just dont see how you dont view it as a fundamental human rights issue im not trying to say that i want fetuses to be aborted but rather that it should in no way shape or form be the decision of anyone except for the mother and that goes for any circumstance as far as i am concerned women should be able to intentionally get pregnant just to have an abortion ala south park im not one of those people who thinks its a slippery slope to fascism but it is akin to denying someone their fundamental human right to self determination yours and my opinion frankly shouldnt matter for shit there is a reason we dont allow the kkk to impose their opinions on anyone you dont deserve a reply from me chicken shit thats ok cuz i got one in all seriousness despite my tone i meant no hard feelings against you personally so sorry if i came off very offensive i just think women should have  control of their body at all times i also wasnt calling you chicken shit i was calling the situation of a woman who is accidentally pregnant but unable to do anything chicken shit you are right regarding selfdetermination dont apologize to people who want to take away fundamental human rights from  of the populace like with so many other issues its time to draw a line in the sand to tell these extremists that we are done playing by their rules they keep pushing and pushing not because they are so worried about the children its about nonsense religious arguments not founded in science control and power otherwise they would gladly hand out contraception to anyone who needs it  thanks feels good to be reassured youre in the right what about in instances of rape you would force a mother to have a child that was a product of assaulti think a bigger problem here is that abortions have happened since the beginning of time in one way or another making it illegal will not stop abortions it will force women into the back alley abortion rights arent about killing fetuses its about saving womens lives i think that would fall under mothers health risks being raped is emotionally destructive and i think the child would be a byproduct of that destruction therefore i believe the mother has that choice to abort in those instances sorry i wasnt more clear i think being forced to have a child growing inside of you when you dont want it there can be just as emotionally destructive could you imagine what it would be like to feel a baby kicking inside of you when you never wanted it there in the first place sounds nightmarish to me gtbut i am against abortion unless the mother is at risk of deathhow can you prevent abortion  you can abort a baby merely by running into something or with a variety of over the counter substances some of which are very damaging to your health  it doesnt require a doctor and can be done in the privacy of your own home  how do you intend to stop itthat is why it is critical that there is safe and easy access to abortion to prevent people from hurting themselves  also because it is the right thing to do and good for society i believe there are instances such as rape and when the health of the mother is at risk when abortions are totally acceptable however it makes me sick to my stomach when a teenage girl takes a risk and doesnt own up to it it sounds harsh but its silly that this is the only area in life where you can make a mistake and can get a get out of jail free card i dont get it gtit sounds harsh but its silly that this is the only area in life where you can make a mistake and can get a get out of jail free cardthis is hardly a get out of jail free card  it is a costly medical procedure with physical and emotional reprocussions for the person who undergoes it  safe and easy access to abortion doesnt make getting pregnant a care free experience it is a traumatic and life changing event for most women who undergo the procedurethere are plenty of other mistakes one can make which have fewer reprocussionsin any case would you rather the teenaged girl have to keep the baby and then end up on welfare supported by the state because she couldnt finish her education and is unemployable or would you rather she have the option to abort get her life together become more responsible from the experience and then have a child and raise it the right way after a few years  people make mistakes and it sucks for everyone but it is much better for society if they have the option to abort  unwanted babies turn into criminals far too often and seriously hurt societyyou seem to only be interested in punishing people for sex like sex should not be for fun it should only be for reproduction youre playing the excluded middle card youre acting like if a teenage girl has a baby her life is over i wentgo to school with  different girls that were undergoing teen pregnancies that opted to have the child  went to high school with me and the other i take a class with in college all  i went to high school with finished school and went on to college the th im in college with had her child and continues to attend school it doesnt have to be either abort or have your life end there are plenty of successful people that had teen pregnancies my girlfriends parents had a teen pregnancy and theyre bringing in k a yearim not saying its easy but people act like having a child is the end of the world if you have a supportive group of people around you and are willing to grab things by the balls and get shit done its more than possible to live an extremely successful life despite a teen pregnancythe problem with teen pregnancy is not the choice of whether or not you can opt out of it the problems stem from parents and people in general that frown upon it like you said sex is fun kids are going to have sex and if they get pregnant its up to the people around them to help them and be supportive not fucking kick them out of their house and treat them like they are less than human thats the problem with teen pregnancy the problem is not widely available abortion routes its great that some people can have teen pregnancies and still be successful  the point is that they do have the choice to abort whether it is legal or not  it is possible and really rather easy to abort yourself if that is what you want to do it just isnt always safeto me the point is that whether that child is prevented from entering the world via the use of a condom or via abortion that unique combination of that particular egg and that particular sperm doesnt get to live doesnt get a chance to be able to live on its own outside the mothers body  that unique life form whether or not you want to call it a person at that stage dies or never exists depending on how you look at it  why would you be ok with that teen girl using a condom when she has sex and that sperm being dumped in the trash and that egg being menstrated into the toilet but not ok with allowing that egg and that sperm to meet up for a few weeks or months before they are tossed out like the worthless byproducts of sex that they are i guess i dont understand problem with subsidized birth control coming people arguing abortion wic program welfare sex adoption what exactly they plan with unwanted children wouldnt cheaper provide  month birth control pills than alternative you have to remember that in these peoples minds there is no such thing as an unwanted child all children are gifts from you know who not he who shall not be named and therefore should be wanted rightas long as its someone elses responsibility and as long as they grow up to pay taxes and live a heterosexual lifestyle yeah if republicans were serious about reducing spending then birth control would be offered free to anyone who wanted it and abortion clinics would be easily accessible to lowincome communities and teenagersseriously the majority of our

that legalized gay marriage in  the state registry of vital records and statistics said it needed to revise its birth certificate forms for babies born to samesex couples the box for father would be relabeled father or second parent reflecting the new law but to thengovernor mitt romney who opposed childrearing by gay couples the proposal symbolized unacceptable changes in traditional family structures continue reading below he rejected the registry of vital records plan and insisted that his top legal staff individually review the circumstances of every birth to samesex parents only after winning approval from romneys lawyers could hospital officials and town clerks across the state be permitted to cross out by hand the word father on individual birth certificates and then write in second parent in ink divisions between the governors office and state bureaucrats over the language on the forms and details about the extraordinary effort by the republican governor to prevent routine recording of births to gay parents are contained in state records obtained by the globe this month deliberations about the policies including dozens of exchanges about the marriages and births of individual families are recounted in emails and legal memos sent between the governors office and lawyers at the department of public health which oversees the registry of vital records the practice of requiring highlevel legal review continued for the rest of romneys term despite a warning from a department of public health lawyer who said such a system placed the children of samesex parents at an unfair disadvantage crossouts and handwritten alterations constituted violations of existing statutes and harmed the integrity of the vital recordkeeping system the deputy general counsel of the department peggy wiesenberg warned in a confidential dec   memo to mark nielsen romneys general counsel romneys insistence on scrutiny harmed the integrity of the vital recordkeeping system one official said the changes also would impair law enforcement and security efforts in a post world she said and children with altered certificates would be likely to encounter difficulties later in life  as they try to register for school or apply for a passport or a drivers license or enlist in the military or register to vote romneys interventions mostly resulted in delays awarding birth certificates for women married to samesex partners who gave birth gay men seeking parental rights were required to take a different route by obtaining a court order by law birth certificates must be issued within  days of birth and in some instances those deadlines were not met most of the birthcertificate reviews by the governors office appeared cursory for example health department deputy counsel wiesenberg emailed brian leske and nielsen on dec   to ask permission to issue a certificate regarding one birth birth at umass memorial medical center facts married mother same sex spouse anonymous donor are similar to  other cases that mark has reviewed  and instructed the hospital to list mother  same sex spouse as the second parent on the childs birth certificate leske emailed back you are authorized to inform the medical center that may list the same sex spouse as a second parent on the birth certificate in one instance in which a couple asked that the handwritten alteration for the second parent say wife instead of second parent the request was denied in another leske refused to allow a birth certificate to be issued listing a samesex couple as the parents because they were not married the romney campaign declined to comment in  the states association of town clerks garnered some attention when it complained publicly about the absence of updated forms calling handwritten changes inappropriate at that time romney spokesman eric fehrnstrom said that the registry of vital records had not changed the birth certificate form because such a change required an act of the state legislature that assertion was contradicted by wiesenberg the department of public health lawyer who told romneys lawyers the previous year that authority to make the changes rested with the department of public health the paper trail suggests other factors were at work beyond a lack of legislative action and romneys public statements left no doubt that he was opposed to marriage and parenting by samesex couples after presenting their proposal for revised forms to romneys chief of staff beth myers in may  department of public health officials were told by a romney staff lawyer via email that there appear to be many complicated issues that should be discussed with many different communities before the changes are made the next month romney delivered remarks before the senate judiciary committee in washington in which he decried the state supreme judicial courts ruling and its effect on childrearing he outlined his misgivings about the request from the registry of vital records the children of america have the right to have a father and a mother romney said in his prepared remarks what should be the ideal for raising a child not a village not parent a and parent b but a mother and a father romney also warned about the societal impact of gay parents raising children scientific studies of children raised by samesex couples are almost nonexistent he said it may affect the development of children and thereby future society as a whole romney expressed similar beliefs during a speech in  to socially conservative voters in south carolina as he was beginning to be viewed as a serious candidate for president some gays are actually having children born to them he declared its not right on paper its not right in fact every child has a right to a mother and father changes to massachusetts birth certificates formally acknowledging children to samesex marriages did not come into effect until after governor deval patrick a democrat assumed office the birthcertificates episode reflects a constantly evolving approach on gay rights for the former massachusetts governor romney ran for senate in  promising to be a moderate champion of homosexual rights but he hardened his stance while governor and during preparations for his  run for president as he sought support from the religious conservatives who vote disproportionately in republican presidential primaries after the supreme judicial court ruling he actively supported efforts in massachusetts for a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman those efforts never bore fruit in his current presidential bid romney continues to oppose gay marriage and has said he supports amending the us constitution to define marriage as between a man and a woman president obama said in may that he supports gay marriage after withholding his judgment for most of his term the globe in june formally asked for records pertaining to the romney administrations deliberations about birth certificates in a preliminary response this month the department of public health withheld most of the documents because they reflected conversations between lawyers working for the state and are therefore exempt from disclosure by the attorneyclient privilege the globe subsequently obtained many of the documents from a source who requested anonymity gayrights advocates have denounced romneys intervention the race religion or sexual orientation of parents should not matter said zach wahls a yearold college student and obama supporter who gained national attention when he testified before an iowa state legislative committee about his experience being raised by two mothers the single most important factor is

missing this exclusively benefit lesbians while intentionally leaving gay men cold i assume the birth certificate looks at the mother strictly as who gave birth while the father is whoever rears the child and not necessarily who took part in sex why if there is some significance to the birth mothers biological relationship that it must be included on the birth certificate surely the same is true for the biological father too likewise if the second parent is merely whoever raises the child surely the first parent can be too  i dunno im just trying to make sense of it how would lesbians benefit what would be so good about being some vague second parent parentparent is an improvement in many forms but second parent mehi think this is the birth certificate made at the birth so yes it assumes a woman has given birth if theres an adoption later a new birth certificate is issuedmy child first had a birth certificate with my wifes name and unknown as the father when i adopted him a few weeks later we got a new birth certificate with both our names if hed been adopted by two men their names would have appeared on itthe idea of lesbians getting the better deal again made me laugh though  not sure where again comes from but if being able to list both parents on the birth certificate is not a benefit then there was no reason to advocate this change no reason for this article to exist at all and romney has done nothing wrong here if there is a point to this changenews though then clearly it benefits lesbians and does not benefit gay males which is very odd given that it was a push to support lgbt families  maybe because a man cannot give birth a trans man could downvotes its a fact everyone every child mother fatherhow about every child indoctrinated faith they consciously choice

in attacking the president for his policy to make birth control affordable and accessible to all american womena policy romney claimed last night to support when he said he too thinks all women should have access to contraceptives in january when the policy was first introduced the romney campaign said this is a direct attack on religious liberty and will not stand in a romney presidency to further appeal to the rabid republican base romney also pledged to end title x which funds family planning programs you know contraception when the policy was enacted in august and republicans were hyperventilating that women having access to affordable birth control was just like  and pearl harbor day romney released an ad accusing the president of declaring a war on religion and lets not

whatever you want as long as you are so wealthy that you dont have to ask the price that anyone who is not rich enough to afford medical care contraception housing food regardless of the price deserves their fate as part of the great unwashed who will not take personal care and responsibility for themselves  it is after all their fault that he shipped their jobs to china because he needed another  profit on an investment it is their fault that medical costs have risen at a much higher rate than inflation on other goods and services that insurance companies skim a good deal of the money to pay for executive salaries and other perks and not health care that corporations need to sit on cash rather than hire people and use the lack of jobs to deflate wages  yes those little people made

and life of the woman with this exobama supporter claiming obamas ads on romneys abortion position are extreme im sculpting now landscapes mostly  yogi bear by extina on wed oct   at  am pdt  notice how in the debate quote he weaseled around the issue i dont believe that bureaucrats in washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not and i dont believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care or not in the narrowest most crabbed and technical sense romneys support of the blunt amendment does not contradict this statement because the blunt amendment is about paying for contraceptives not about legal access so employers cant tell someone whether they can have contraceptives but they can tell them to pay for it themselves is this a bs distinction of course it is but it is also typical of republican obfuscation on this and other issues pretend that the actual ability to access contraceptives in reallife circumstances doesnt matter only the theoretical ability to do so counts in other words pretend that class doesnt matter thats why obamas comeback on this issue when he emphasized that this is a family issue was so

health group insurance must provide coverage to pay for contraception romney was and is opposed but that is not the same thing at all on the other hand romney will if he can name supreme court judges who will overturn roe probably by denying there is a constitutional right to privacy and if that goes states will be able to use the law to forbid or limit not only abortion but also sale or use of contraception  by philo vaihinger on wed oct   at  am pdt  inability to pay out of pocket  women wont get it  defunding planned parenthood and letting insurers and employers refuse to cover

mean no is contrasted with his prior no its been a hundred years isnt it time we stopped blaming captain smith for sinking the titanic by happymisanthropy on wed oct   at  am pdt  parent  words he says i dont believe that bureaucrats in washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not and i dont believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care or not every woman in america should have access to contraceptives   this could literally be construed as true because what he is trying to do is to allow the bureaucrats to make women pay for the contraceptives so sure we can have them but hes going make it as difficult as possible by closing down planned parenthood and making catholic hospitals off limits and supporting legislation that will not let insurance companies pay for contraceptives  but of course that wont reflect what he believes  i mean he is trying to mislead the ignorant with his every breath but he gives himself denial room even his statement about the president being wrong about his policy gives him deniability in his view because who the hell knows what his policy is if not him and his constant obfuscation makes this interpretable only by him  by derridog on wed oct   at  am pdt  once again mitt is practicing wordplay when he says sure there are republicans that would gladly outlaw contraception but there are many more that grudgingly support the concept but dont think insurance companies or the government should pay for it so when they hear mitts statement above they can parse their way to agreeing with him  what democrats need to stress more clearly and what the president touched on last night is that for many people people that can barely pay for their familys meals its not access thats important it is affordable access without insurance support contraception may as well be illegal because theyre not going to be able to afford to buy it so mitt thinks he can have it both ways when he says  by chronicfatigue on wed oct   at  am pdt  that this was another instance of romney not following the rules before his lying lie about contraception heres the exchange there was a new question from the audience but the president i dont think so candy i want to make sure your timekeepers are working here governor romney the time  ms crowley the timekeepers are all working the president all right ms crowley and let me tell you that the last part its for the two of you to talk to one another and it isnt quite as ordered as you think but go ahead and use this two minutes any way youd like to the question is on the floor  by randolph on wed oct   at  am pdt  to be honest romney would probably reply that what he means is that the government shouldnt be paying for contraceptive care or forcing companies to provide contraceptive coverage in their employersponsored health care benefit plans if they object to it he doesnt want the government providing funding for planned parenthood  im sure hed say that if pp can survive purely on private donations then he doesnt have a problem with them existing and that as long as the government isnt funding contraceptive care either directly with money or indirectly with government mandates for coverage then sure everyone can of course have access to contraception its dumb shortsighted and ignores the reality of womens health care in this country not to mention imposing ones religious views on everyone else by denying funding for a particular womens health treatment as well as ignoring the economic impact of unplanned pregnancies and  damn i could go on and on but the point is hes not really lying assuming he truly believes that pp is fine as long as its privately funded and every woman should have access to contraception as long as its not directly or indirectly enabled by the government its a ridiculous position and for the life of me i cant get my head around why anyone would give a damn if someone else is taking birth control pills but i also dont understand why they care if someone else is gay or has a different religion or skin color terrorists are a dime a dozen they are all over the world and for every one we

why would massachusets elect him as governor if they hate  hated himall four of these states are liberal states romney never had a chance to begin with california  hasnt gone republican since  bush sr quite frankly i dont see california going republican ever againmichigan  hasnt gone republican since  bush srmassachusetts  hasnt gone republican since  reaganbush sr  they won every state except minnesotanew hampshire  pretty democratic recently besides voting bush in  they havent voted republican since  bush sr and i think they regret their  decision because just as right now he lied about his positions to get elected he promised the people of massachusetts certain policies and actionswhen he got elected there he just did what his voters wanted him to dowhats so bad about that no he didnt he thought he was going to use the governorship of massachusetts to propel him into national office he vetoed  bills from the massachusetts legislature who actually are doing what their voters want them to do and was out of the state for  days of his term by the end of his term romney was hated in ma and he didnt run again because he was already trying to shore up his support for a  presidential bid not that he could have won reelectionhes a weasel he spent  million of his own money in  trying to buy the gop nomination and came in last gtthen why would massachusets elect him as governor if they hate  hated himif you look at his policy now vs then hes quite different he  cosigned in universal health care for massachusetts with ted kennedy the romney we know today wouldnt be caught dead doing that romney just did his job as a politician to give and support what his voters wantedis that really so bad it is when we have no fucking idea what hes going to do next and hell be one of the most powerful and influential people in the world if he has done what his voter base has asked of him then how does that indicate hes erratiche ran for governor in a mainly democratic and liberal state he said hed do what they want and he didhes now running for the presidency as a republican candidate he says hes going to do what they askhow is it that complicated its complicated and downright disturbing because as you say he governed in a liberal state with more liberal policies yet he claims he was a severely conservative governor  the fact is he is just saying anything to an audience in order for them to fall for it  he is a deceptive marketeer gt then why would massachusets elect him as governor if they hate  hated himvoter elasticitymaybe  new term i learned may be using it wrong romney was a republican when massachusetts elected him as their governor arnold schwarzenegger californias former governor was also a republican notice that he only had one term in massachusetts  massachusetts went  years only electing republican governors from  to   they seem to have a disconnect between who they prefer to be governor and who they prefer to be president i think the better question is why does mitt choose to live in liberal states so the republican party shouldnt have politicians in liberal statesand the democratic party shouldnt have politicians in republican statesor they at least shouldnt entertain an opposing candidate to such a statewhats so bad about being a republican and running in a democratic state and vice versayoure saying that no republican should run for anything in a liberal state like california massachusets new york etcand youre saying that no democract should run for anything in a republican state like arizona utah idaho etcmakes no sense to shame someone for winning an election in a state that normally doesnt vote for their party strawmen aplenty did you go to the strawman wholesaler well he lived in mass because he was governor there and he should not be limited to republican states because hes republicanhe was born in michigan i guess not much of a choice therecalifornia has nice real estate and there are thing besides politics when it comes to moving somewherewhy is it that he cant go to a liberal state if hes republicanif youre liberal or a democrat should you be frowned upon for moving to a republican stateand apparently he has a vacation home in new hampshirebut please tell me why he shouldnt be allowed to have any residency in a liberal state as someone from mass look we fucked up gt quite frankly i dont see california going republican ever againever againthere arent even a whole lot of states that have only voted for  party in the past  years alone you know it was a bit of a hyperbole gtthen why would massachusets elect him as governor if they hate  hated himwell lots of politicians are elected and then hated by the end of their run    fuck came here to say that btw iama masshole so i know him and his policies well i couldnt say it better myself it romney chosen live exclusively liberal states wonder why is yes why doesnt he retire to oklahoma or mississippi clearly those must be better places to live than liberal california  because without exception red states are shitholes but texas gonna be blue by  hopefully by  definitely tx empire almost all big cities in the south are liberal here is texas in the  elections all the major cities are labelledsee a pattern the more educated more diverse higher income people in the cities vote democrat while poor white folks in the rural areas vote republicanas for southern texas im guessing its because of mexicans who generally vote for democrat immigration policies gtalmost all big cities are liberalftfy even slc in superconservative utah votes democrat religiously i love telling republicans this and watching them squirm without texas they know it will be hard pressed to win future elections the only rebuttal ive gotten is not if we can help it we just have to get that communist out of office firsti live in the south by the way ive read that if voting were mandatory than texas would go blue every election due to the large amount of minorities read latins and blacks that vote almost exclusively blue its unfortunate that so many people dont vote on the most important election in the country and a very important election world wide considering the uss influence and then both parties will lean harder left so the balance will be restoredthe republicans will have a good chance of winning  but will be fielding a candidate whos more socialist than obama  good its about time our moral compass caught up with the times and the rest of the world weve been stuck in the past for a while now i would actually say   if my relatives are any indication only once obama is gone if texas goes blue i predict the republicans will start pushing for some major electoral college reform or try to get rid of it altogether if texas goes blue i predict that the two party system will change in that the republican party will minimize and the dem party will split  why in gods name would the democrats split as a result of texas voting a democrat for president imagine if you will that one party gets  of the representatives  now everything that party wants to pass is going to pass  however not all people in that party agree with everything the party does and start forming caucuses  even though the party isnt split on a lot of things some of these representatives wind up being single issue voters  now imagine that this government passes all of the things the majority party has a general consensus on  what thenwell the party now split on ideological lines on the things it disagrees on is no longer able to come to a consensus  people start running against half of the party but this really just creates a subparty of the originalgranted this is hypothetical but this is what i imagine happening if one party becomes extraordinarily dominant i heard austins pretty cool ive been to way too many cities in texas austin is the only one i would happily go back to  then again im a pot smoking bleeding heart liberal so maybe im just biased it is houston is a pretty sweet city as well dallas is a shit hole though my wife who lived in dallas for a while swears that its the other way around to be honest i only visited a few times its surrounded by dry counties and the highway system sucks the wealthyincredibly poor divide bothers me a lot as well there are so many businesses and so many people making ridiculous money in that city and at the same time there is a ridiculous amount of poverty the trees are the right height better places to keep a vacation home nate silver goto things polling dude shit while i do agree with nate silver in his assessment it is hard to really believe in anyone making predictions in politics there are so many variables in politics like sex scandals and criminal elements that it makes it almost impossible to predict the outcome of an election obama is lucky though that everything bad he did was pretty much already brought up in  there isnt much that can be said this year except directly attacking his performance which is why they are doing it note that nates predictions were crazy accurate in  too gt while i do agree with nate silver in his assessment it is hard to really believe in anyone making predictions in politics hes not doing that not at all what are you freaking talking aboutthats completely and utterly contrast to everything he does he doesnt ever make any claim even remotely like things will go this way statistics is advanced math  or advanced arithmetic if you will is that at all related to my comment yes the poster you are responding to does not understand the nuance of probability  to say someone has a  chance of winning does not mean he will win but if the election were held  times he would win with a level of confidence  times  i do not think that poster gets how probability works and most americans  do not understand polls accurately because statistics the backbone of polling data is advanced math and this country struggles teaching citizens more basic applications gamblers accurately predict elections most of the time as well people get quite good at making money off of anything mostly because they want to earn money and not lose it you think romney has a  chance of winning hope it is  that percentage doesnt reflect the amounts of voted hes gonna get especially not the popular vote the number is a statistically calculated number generated from his assessment of what state is giving which candidate their electoral votes so yeah that number isnt far from the truth read up on what the numbers mean dont just look at them and assume this dude whose whole life is based around political predictions is wrong  i asked a real simple questionyou are the one assuming that i cant understand percentages and numbersi think its laughable to think that romneys chances of winning are that low  actually it makes perfect sense look at his electoral vote predictions most of the states that he has leaning towards obama have early voting and a high population of the likely voters have casted their ballot and those states seem to be predominantly obama  if you play out the electoral map thats not that far off right now assuming romney carries all states hes polling at a more than  win and obama carries all states hes polling at a more than  win the numbers favor obama greatly he will likely win michigan nevada and pennsylvania romney will likely win florida and north carolina that leaves ohio virginia colorado new hampshire iowa and wisconsin  obama only needs one of these states two if one is new hampshire and he wins romney needs all of these states which is not likely particularly because ohio has been leaning obama all election our job is to make him a noterm president romneys real place residence la jolla i why media point often hell spend day bashing california thats where hell live rest days every la jolla resident hates him he wants to build his residency into a  huge multistory mansion which would block out the view of the beach for most of his neighbors hes pretty much an egregious dickbag in every aspect you can imagine he seriously doesnt care about anyone except himself and it reflects daily in his personal lifesource i am from southern california and my friend lives next to him its a conservative wealthy area he wont mind it the coastal areas of la jolla are actually pretty liberal the gerrymandering of san diego county is interesting according to fox news ca is nothing but hippie libruls one of his neighbors is a gay couple but not one of those gay couples so its okay  yeah orange county ca southern california actually has a huge tea party population heres a racist orange county tea party protest against muslims northern california on the other hand is most definitely a liberal area northern california isnt the bay area and the coastal counties yes but the interior of northern california is not liberal indeed my home county in california san joaquin county is about as liberal as most inlandinlandish areas get its basically purple right now but it was a lot more rightwing in the early s and the s most of the bay area and most everything along the coastlines which is where all the population happens to be is democrat southern california has had a weirdly radical right wing minority for a few decades they had a problem with neonazis in the s and s i think its the backlash against the state for being so liberal the rebellious types are going to take a fundementalist stance against whatever theyre surrounded by  i did not realize he had ties to california  urgh california do people honestly think cali will red state once you leave the san francisco or los angeles metro areas it pretty much is  i was driving through oakdale not long ago  i swear to god every truck had a confederate flag sticker on it im californian born and raised in a republican area and i have never seen a confederate flag sticker on a car santee and fallbrook thems the neonazi sanctuary  i dont think this is accurate i live in a county just outside sf and ive lived in sf bay area most of my life the entire sf bay area is extremely liberal strangers might even confront you for displaying a confederate flag you see a republican bumper sticker once in a blue moon and everyone automatically scoffs at it its actually kind of narrow minded for how open minded it is the hinterlands of california are not exactly where the growth of this state is coming from  that is irrelevant no way a republican losing california wtfnext thing you democrat going losing texas hell win massachusetts we experienced governing fact hes unfit presidency i attended and felt extraordinarily place at paul ryan rally mi he confident reassured crowd romney would win michigani hilarious he almost has to honestly would be extremely awkward to stand up there and say we dont have a chance in hell of winning his state but it feels good to be here today it must be awkward to waste time in michigan just because fox calls it a swing state  to imagine this brings me joy i cant believe that there isnt more uproar about romney losing michigan theres no way that were going to vote for him and michigan isnt even really a blue state anymore youre right saying romney isnt going to win michigan but its definitely still a blue state ehhh yeah we have two democrat senators for now at least although i do think that stabenow will keep her seat but outside of lansing and detroit the vast majority of the state is hard red i hope that stabenow keeps her seat hoekstra is a gradea douchebag but we also have mike rogers et al in the house ewwww and ann arbor were almost exclusively blue here for more than one reason  i lumped everything near detroit into that bundleyeah youre too far out to be a detroit burb i should have said the general se portion of the stateps you suck love a spartan who is angry that his team absolutely blew it im from emu so i dont care a whole lot about blue but you gotta admit that was an intense game i do wish the sparties took it so all these m nuts would hush lol state level politicians do not reflect the presidential leanings of the statei mean how many states dont have a oh were republicandemocrat but weve got a democratrepublican in high office situation hey now  grand rapids is solid blue  were just surrounded by assholes idkwhile gr is a bigger city you do have a lot of the devosy folks vomit lets hope  states then i noticed day its pretty clear sign hes governor state hes going lose   he technically losing all states hes taking utah all rest though he has a lot of home states he doesnt have a house in utah does he ski lodge it seems i guess he doesnt spend enough time there to turn the state against him its a really naive presumption the current polls have massachusetts at  rcp average for obamas margin in  that margin was  in  kerrys margin was  in  gore won with a  margin thats been a fairly good stretch of large margins for the democratic candidate in massachusetts so numerically if in the last  elections was between  for the democrat and romney being known makes it worse then you would logically expect an even bigger margin instead its a noticibly smaller margin so romney is doing better than expected there racist southies as im massachusetts vote romney pretty shitty state its massachusetts they going vote democrat lived here just way is they elected a republican senator gtthey elected a republican senatorfor his independent policies is independent policies slang for pickup truck i dont think so i think they voted for him not based on his party affiliation i thought the argument was the margin by which he would be losing if he was so wonderful as a governor you would think more of them would be voting for him

culpressler jun   pm credit  planned parenthoods action fund is sending a costumed package of birth control dubbed pillamina out on the campaign trail to highlight mitt romneys opposition to president obamas birth control coverage provision in a statement introducing pillamina planned parenthood action fund president cecile richards noted that her organization wants to emphasize the fact that birth control is an economic issue for women  period thats something that president obama clearly understands and that mitt romney simply doesnt romney has said that he opposes requiring insurers to offer birth control coverage without additional copays image via planned parenthood ","commentContent":"thats hilarious i knew birth control circles rectangle edge this is a classic representation of bc  it used to come some brands still do in a dial pack that flipped open  in the interest of saving money pharmas now use the simple foil packs if i remember correctly the initial idea behind that design was that it could be disguised as a makeup compact so you could carry it around without attracting attention   i always had rectangular packs as well  three different brands  until my most recent switch now ive got a little circular foil pack that goes in a clamshell holder its weeeeeird to be honest with you im kinda jealous of the jazzy holder things i only seem to get little card sleeves to put them in and i can never be arses to use them  awesome the comments sad  yeah i had to close that out pretty quickly is mitt romney birth control ive heard before he is against the mandate put forth by obama that insurance companies cover bc and to offer it without a copay  obama believes that access to bc for all women is a basic right  romney cant wrap his brain around not being able to afford things   why should there be no copay dont most medications require a copay a small copay wouldnt be an issue but  depending on the insurance company and the type of birth control  these copays can be over  which is usually just a few dollars less than getting it without insurance  this puts birth control out of the realm of possibility for some people then why cant this be the perfect opportunity for charity like planned parenthood to step in i was under the impression that pp offered birth control for dirt cheap for those that qualify there have to be other charities and organizations out there that help people pay for bc arent there a lot of pharmaceutical manufacturers will even help people pay for their medication if they cant afford it that being said ive never heard of anyone paying over  dollars a month for birth control unless maybe its something special like the nuva ring combined with the worst insurance ever but that still sounds pretty dang high even when i had crappy insurance i was paying  bucks a month for mine as much as having free things is cool and all why is it that we as women specifically should be entitled to free birth control nothing in life is free free or dirt cheap birth control isnt just beneficial for women its beneficial for society in general check out this articlein summary not having babies reduces insurance costs and relieves everyone else of the burden of caring for unwantedunaffordable children through social servicesedit wrong article oopsalso i would totally support a free condom or male pill program if that ever gets finished i only have to pay  for a  month supply myself but other arguments i  remember off the top of my head when this has came up was stuff like i dont remember this being romney specific politicianx who is against this is also against pp so where do they expect people to get it now generally this means that politicianx is also antiabortion so this means unwanted babies will be born  unwanted kids tend to be foster kids subject to abuse people that cant afford  or even  or  like us to emphasize it since we do have lower copays sure as fuck wont be able to afford a baby which would be an even bigger cost than if they just provided bc to begin with in fact it would pass the cost on to us since birthin babies isnt cheap if people cant afford bc without insurance theyre going to have welfare babies wic babies which would be a bigger drain on society with welfare section  food stamps free school lunches whatever federal money that would have otherwise not been used since the child would be non existant nutrition facts jigglybellypuff is not a significant amount of sources  these could all be arguments for supporting charities though i guess i just dont like the idea of the government forcing businesses to provide a product for free that just means it ends up getting paid for by every body else  i get what you mean honestly i said the same thing before i was told that it pays for itselfwould benefit them too because its cheaper than birthin babiesi then said if that is the casewouldnt they already be doing it because it benefits their bottom line nobody really answered me i got half as responses like yeah because businesses always make sense lol  i personally have a weird stance on the issue because nobody gave my any real numbers it left me skeptical about a lot i dont feel too strongly either way to tell the truth i dont think i have enough information my stance is simply i dont like politicians that are both against insurance companies paying for it and for defunding pp because then wed all be fucked  think progress neither

showed a clip of a herovoter who asked mitt romney an important questiondoes he want to outlaw birth control this is an issue because romney supports socalled personhoodamendments in which fertilized eggs are considered people not only does this type of legislation effectively ban abortion roe v wadebe damned  it could also lead to bans on hormonal birth control as well as murder investigations of women who miscarry so if romney supports personhood amendments does that mean he also wants to ban some forms of birth control romney didnt really have an answer for that voter and maddow think he may not understand exactly how birth control and uteri work so she explained it to him the whole segment is well worth a watch and you should do so right here visit msnbccom for breaking news world news and news about the economy","commentContent":"my problem with segment addressed men them female anatomyconception works assumed women know to fair lot women their body works yeah i it its joke addressed romney clueless personhood supporters than men general it would point funny i appreciate your comment  i adore rachel maddow for her intelligence and ability to break down complex issues in an interesting fashion but i found myself pretty offended by her approach during this segment  i think she conflated mitts avoidance in answering the question with not knowing how bc works  and then went even further by heavily implying that men as a general group of humans lack understanding of women pretty condescending imo  personally i think he just didnt want to own up to a political position that he knows is untenable hoping to hold on to the little support he has from an irrational republican base  maddows keen political insight failed her at this particular moment she has a point though its mostly men in politics and while they may be familiar with some of these things they dont know as much about women as they could i think this situation is perfectly analogous to technology related legislation where people whose concept of the internet is a series of tubes are the ones making the laws it seems like to them the vagina is just a series of tubes as well you make a very good point about our politicians there are several issues which they do not seem to be knowledgeable enough to make sound decisions i just would have preferred if maddow hadnt implied that ignorance of female birth control is exclusive to men i agree that current politicians mostly conservatives have shown disinterest bordering on blatant contempt for womens health but the way she told the ladies to exit the room so she could have a talking to the men was extremely condescending  she shouldnt have generalized all men in that way  we are individuals as well  and she didnt even convince me that mitts political bulletdodging was due to malespecific ignorance and not just him avoiding a question that leaves egg on his face yeah that makes sense in regards to mitt i usually like maddow too i was really disappointed with this  i didnt know and i consider myself to be an intelligent guy i doubt many of my male friends would know in detail how the pill works either  but then none of us are contemplating passing laws on the subject the pill just works right haha right the pill is actually magic i dont know what maddow is talking about hereim sure its true that a lot of men dont know how the pill works but a lot of women dont either i just didnt like how she singled out all men instead of just romney and the personhood bunch and told women they could leave the room the whole man cave men cant understand anything without beer and football thing was insulting too just think if a similar segment was made that replaced the man cave with a kitchen and football and beer with makeup and shoes a man cave is a place of relaxation and enjoyment a place that stereotypically involves men feeling free to be themselves while many women and men do enjoy cooking baking etc a kitchen is stereotypically a place of work for women it is insulting in a different way however im sure that some comedians daily show maybe could pull off women shopping in a funny but informative way ok then replace kitchen with mall like i said i do believe that there are people who could pull that off in a funny but informative way according wikipediayeah primary mechanism

apply to him just as it does obamagttypical progressive liberals demading more equality for themselves than for others typical no matter the issuewell technically obama isnt the primary candidate there are people who are running against obama and have just as much of a chance winning as ron paulgtpossibly because they have history and extended family that reaches back for generations and is

prison not the whlol the irony the republicans engineered the greatest economic disaster since the great depression stole the election doubled the debt horrible job record and in general royally fucked this country but nope its obamas fault his grand plan for the destruction of america includes his aggressive focus on killing bin laden actual net gain of jobsmillions created with a total net gain in the hundreds of thousands and unemployment is declining all of this whilist the president is trying to ruin our great country haha mr president we are on to your gamemore from megagtthey do if they want to appeal to those who do remember obama is a mirror hes anything you want him to be his words before election lol well obama has remained fairly consistent on the platform he ran on too bad the same is true for mitt romney that guy is known for his unwavering principles and not known for flip flopping and etchasketching sit goes on further in the comments that obama never released his

the place that we were born and raised yeergh this stretches the definition of joke as do most romney jokes but unlike his usual jocular fumblings theres no place like chrome for the hollandaise this one plays into the birther nonsense i would expect this sort of thing from donald trump but not from mitt you just cant  yeeergh usually i groan at mitt romney jokes because they are so bad this time i am groaning because this isnt a joke of course no one has asked for mitt romneys birth certificate except for a few people who were jocularly implying that he was a robot his first name is willard the only reason you would want to see willard mitt romneys birth certificate was to make certain there wasnt another even more ssounding name he could possibly use this is birtherism in a nutshell naturally no one has asked for mitt romneys birth certificate you know where he was born and raised he is not the sort of person you ask for a birth certificate thats the whole point now barack obama on the other hand he is at best hawaiian birtherism is a good visible indicator of exactly how many people it is possible to fool all the time its an embarrassingly large number either people genuinely believe that this barack obama fellow could not legitimately come from this country which is bad or they are cynically calling it into question to point out that the president is not like you which is worse ha ha this joke says the president is an exotic specimen i am not i was born at harper hospital i am like you you dont ask a white man in a buttondown with a name like willard where he was born ha ha great joke but the president has joked about it well yes he has clearance coming from romney it just sounds like an inept attempt to point out how much more like you than barack obama mitt romney is this was off the cuff the crowd liked it birther jokes are not new on the campaign trail so it is easy to see how it slipped out ha you can picture mitt thinking the presidents birth certificate is a topic that people sometimes make jokes about i too will make such a joke but still birtherism itself is a joke and not a particularly amusing one its the kind of embarrassing

 mitt romney has attacked the obama administrations regulation requiring employers and insurers to provide reproductive health care services  including contraception  by arguing that the rule is undermining the religious liberties of catholics and imposing a secular vision on americans who believe that they should not have their religious freedom taken away as thinkprogress has reported romneys newfound sensitivities contradict his record as governor of massachusetts  where he accepted a very similar contraception equity law  and his previous public commitments to increasing public funding for birth control in  romney even asked the massachusetts department of health to issue regulations requiring all hospitals to issue emergency contraception to rape victims without providing an exception for catholic hospitals now an examination of romneys financial investments reveals that the very same gop frontrunner who is now petitioning the white house to extend the regulations conscience clause and exclude more women from the benefits of birth control is himself invested in and profiting from pharmaceutical companies that produce the frequently prescribed and extremely common medication romneys goldman sachs  exchange place fund valued at over a million dollars in  brought in nearly  in gains in  and is invested in  watson pharmaceuticals manufacturer of nine forms of emergency contraception which romney incorrectly identifies as abortifacients  johnson  johnson launched the first us prescription birth control product in  and produces various forms of birth control  merck produces various forms of birth control  mylan produces birth control medication and filed the first application for a generic birth control pill last year  pfizer a contraception producer that recently had to recall about a million packs of birthcontrol pills that werent packaged correctly romney often disclaims any responsibility for or knowledge of his own investments by claiming that they are held in a private trust but since filing his legallyrequired public financial disclosure reports and certifying that the information is true complete and correct to the best of his knowledge the trust ceased to be a blind trust as he knew what was in it romney signed such disclosure forms last august and during his unsuccessful  presidential bid in august

republican presidential candidate mitt romney and his running mate paul ryan speak at a campaign rally in manassas virginia on august   do you believe in freedom of religion president obama does and he is defending americans freedom of religion against mitt romney and fox newsin the administration of his health care bill the president allows each woman to decide for herself whether or not to ask her insurance company to cover contraception if this violates a womans religious principles she would never aska woman would make such a request only if contraception fit her principles in short the president has guaranteed that each woman can act according to her religious principles he has made a strong defense of freedom of religion in difficult cases he has extended freedom of religion even further beyond people to churches and houses of worship insurance companies are required to cover contraception with no copays for the women whose health care they are covering this guarantees freedom of religion for the women covered and does not affect insurance companies which are neither people nor religious institutions what about hospitals charities with a religious affiliation and religious employers who have a moral objection to contraception women getting health care paid through these institutions will be able to obtain contraception from the insurance companies not the religious institutions thus the president has found a way to extend freedom of religion not only to all women but even beyond people to churches and religious employers this makes president obama a remarkable champion of freedom of religion in contemporary american history moreover president obama is very much in touch with the values of americans a recent gallup poll has shown that in the us  per cent of catholics think that birth control is morally acceptable  per cent of noncatholics believe the same overall  per cent of americans agree on this in the may  poll gallup tested beliefs about the moral acceptability of  issues total including divorce gambling stem cell research the death penalty gay relationships and so on contraception had by far the greatest approval rating divorce the next on the list had only  per cent approval compared to  per cent for contraception mitt romney and fox news on the other hand are proposing a huge backward step on freedom of religion romney has said he would support a bill that would allow employers and insurers to deny their female employees insurance coverage for birth control and other health services based on the religious beliefs of the employers and insurers as far as employers are concerned this fits with president obamas policy but the extension to insurance companies violates the freedom of religion that the president guaranteed to women in addition romney has said he would get rid of planned parenthood an organization that allows women freedom of religion by supplying contraception if they choose to ask for it this would be another major blow to freedom of religion in short romney is advocating and would take a big backward step to deny freedom of religion to women incidentally romneys ad which falsely accuses the president of what romney himself is advocating namely denial of religious freedom is entitled be not afraidusing biblical language as if he were god or a prophet given that  per cent of the american people support contraception we have no reason to be afraid of romney  unless we let him get away with his attempt to frame the president as being against religion the presidents advance in promoting freedom of religion should be shouted from the rooftops  wwwthelittleblueblogorg  authors of the little blue book the essential guide to thinking and talking democratic","commentContent":"because women peoples religious beliefs dictate their sexual lives right how politicans think okay something something god something something funny how they always miss the part about giving away all your possessions to the poor they hear what they want to hear just shows how deeply ignorant they are no no they have well thought out arguments about why thats not really what jesus meant he couldnt expect the rich to give their possessions to the poor could he jesus was black ronald reagan is the devil and the government lied to you about  ronald wilson reagan each of his names has six letters  man doesnt that offend you   this is the most articulate representation of the argument  something something small gubmint something something also jesus exactly  as a woman i cannot tell you how much this enrages me  i try to be a good person i honestly try not to hate and be tolerant but this this just brings out such rage in me i cannot describe it is this legal  i mean really is this man so completely out of touch with reality this man  no sorry these ideologies are supported by a large chunk of the republican party   has the world gone insane  is there no common sense anymore have you seen the tea party i try not to  i used to read rpolitics everyday to be up on current events got myself so stressed out  yeah it may be time to head back to raww  its disheartening  so many of their stances are geared to bring us back to last century or even further back  i just keep shaking my head in disbelief you should really find an alternative for current events if you really use rpolitics for newsthis place is a joke no its not a joke entire news sources are a joke which is fucking why there is a thing called comments  i think you forgot to mention ows no just america seriously come to canada none of that shit here  oh my family and i moved  to europe  years ago  but thanks for the offer   republican here bracing for downvotes my reasoning is that employers shouldnt be forced to buy anything for their employees they shouldnt have to pay for your lunches they shouldnt have to provide outstanding dental coverage etc if people want to get birth control great go buy it with the money your employer provides you but dont demand that the employer pay for your birth control i agree why is this such a difficult concept i just dont get it i really dont if i am buying you your health insurance i should be able to decide which type of health insurance i buy  gt these ideologies are supported by a large chunk of the republican party like professional grifter ron paul  you have the option of purchasing the pills yourself  for a  day supply at walgreens alternatively you can work for a noncatholic employerthe result of this is catholic employers will drop insurance coverage for all employees and pay the  fine to which people will announce a triumph of deficit reduction  of all us employers plan to drop coverage mostly for cost reasons and there will be fewer people insured in the future than currently because of these changes in the law sorry but im not exactly sure what everyone is upset about  you mean to tell me that you are going to go work for the catholic church and then be upset that their insurance plan doesnt cover abortion  if you dont like their policy then go work somewhere else were not talking about abortion here  were talking about birth control which is also used as treatment for hormonal reasons  dont confuse the two issues  and please tell me why the catholic church and other religious organizations pay minimal taxes or are tax exempt  because thats costing this taxpayer more money  why am i being forced to pay on behalf of religious organizations   im sorry but how is giving a company the ability to completely run itself according to its beliefs illegal if you dont like a religiously run company who stands by its beliefs then dont work therei feel like this is such a simple idea that people seem to just not understand and other health serviceswho decides on these other health services  does that include mammograms hormonal imbalance treatments etcit sounds to me like what youre suggesting is that we have insurance companies for each religion nonreligion and philosophies  so as a person looking for work i should search for a company and their insurance company who match my beliefs  if we all go separate then why are religious organizations tax exemptpay minimal taxes  why are they not held to the same standards as this tax payer   just because a company has the ability to be run religiously and give out benefits based on it does not mean all will you act as though if they were given the opportunity that all businesses would turn into westborro on steroids chillax i dont know man look around the world lately   what chickfila go work at mcdonalds then honestly thats the most intelligent response you can think of  sad why should a company be forced to pay for your birth control why should a religious organization not pay their fair share of taxes you do realize that no one is talking about outlawing birth control right its only about not forcing everyone to pay for your birth control via insurance premiumsand honestly i dont quite get why i have to pay for your birth control its not a health issue since its not curing any physical ailment should you have to pay for my condoms though if you argue that it can also be argued that birth control is used for more than as a contraceptive so yes it relieves ailments just like other hormonal drugs for people who have imbalances hormones  theres quite a few medications that dont specifically cure a physical ailment gt to deny their female employeesbased on religious beliefsthats what i have a problem with  please tell me again religious organizations pay minimal taxare tax exempt  why i am paying for the beliefs of other people  i see this as discrimination  twofold  against women and against people who may practice a different religionor none than the employermaybe if men took birth control pills and this issue came up youd feel differently  also birth control is used for as hormonal treatmentand to be perfectly honest with you if my insurance would pay for your condoms so there would not be unwanted pregnancies in the world millions of children that no one wants yeah id pay for your condoms  why not  because lets keep it real people will have sex  majority do not wait until getting married  thats the way it is   if youre so concerned about the money then you should be all for covering birth control including condoms as dealing with the fallout of unprotected sex  from stds to abortions to child protective services education and increased crime rates from handling unwanted children  costs society vastly more gthow do these politicans think this is okay because theyre not women the men in charge are just jealous of your awesome orgasms those women will thank them once they die and are able to enter narnia because government is meant to follow the bible except where i deem unnecessary  how is my company or insurer not paying for someones birth control coverage amount to dictating her sexual life  how does that prevent her from having recreational sexhow is it so many things today fall under the category of i shouldnt have to pay for that everyone else needs to take up a collection for me you could make the argument that government should not coerce business to provide insurance in the first place thus any coverage could be considered a benefit in addition to wage  and individuals could purchase supplements as they pleasehowever this is not the argument that is being made by republicans so yeah they basically just hate women its not even sexual lives birth control is extremely beneficial to many aspects of a female body its also not so good for the body in lots of cases  just saying definitely thats why it should be the womans choice but it is the womans choice nobody is taking that away from her they just dont want to pay for it im not saying i support mitt but i dont think your argument holds water nobody is dictating others lives nobodys saying they cant have sex nobodys saying they cant use contraception they just dont want to have to pay for you to have sex or take said contraception its more like telling women they are the business property in a way  because employers need to have other peoples religious beliefs dictate how they spend their money right how does anyone think this is okay birth control pills can be had for around  a month condoms for less than that  why is it so hard to afford and why should someone else pay for it why cant people take responsibility themselves for something like this im with you why do women need them do condoms suddenly not work someone not paying for your bc isnt dictating your sexual life devils advocate time why should other peoples sexual lives dictate what i should buy for them because most of the country is christian and there are many that loudly exclaim that birth control is eviledit negative votes when i had evidence must be rpolitics and pretty much every christian woman in this nation has been on birth control at one point in their lives but those good evangelical girls are less likely to use birth controland can wear their teen momdom as a badge of honor  hypocrisy in my christianity  its more likely than you think gt because most of the country is christian and there are many that loudly exclaim that birth control is evilthis is patently untrue and regardless does not give you the right to dictate anything to me based on your religious beliefswe seriously need to get back to a separation of church amp state freedom from religion  derpus census data for  in thousandsgtadult population total gtchristian totalsoi guess i was correct why dont you go back to the source article and read about the part where even though the country is  chritian it is  in favor of birth control  if you want to add numbers to the game you cannot ignore the numbers that are given in the start of the topic to begin withthat is why you are being downvoted above  not because you think you have proof but because you are ignoring the article that we are supposed to be discussing here and thus not adding to the conversation hah no i am being downvoted because it clashes with what ratheism wants to believe this is rpolitics facts dont matter just spin besides my statement that the country is mostly christian is true which is what i refutedgtand thus not adding to the conversationi like how the reddiquette is quoted when its convenient and ignored  of the time because someone didnt like what you said you dont get to pickandchoose when to use it youd think the ideologues would get that at leastedit spelling have fun with your victim card  it seems to be the only one you want to play your original statement was not just about the population of christians but the amount of christians that decry birth control ignoring the facts presented ive met very very few people claiming to be christian who actually are no true scotsman there arent that many but they are very loud theyre wrong too employers can excercise their free religion too  if its against their conscience to supply certain abortificants they are justified in doing so  religious freedom romney is promoting it obama is supressing it so strange how it can be spun either wayits bafflingsay a jewish guy owns a deli  a new study comes out showing how great ham is  it can not only prevent pregnancy but it can cure cancer and kill the hiv virus  even still the goverment has no right to say this orthodox jewish man has to offer ham on his sandwiches or to his employees  it would violate his freedom of religion to practice as he sees fit  same situation here gtif its against their conscience to supply certain abortificantsexcept that the employers are not handing out contraceptives this is merrily requiring insurance companies to cover contraceptives in case the employee by their choice wants them  jewish sandwich suppliers wouldshould never be required to supply ham sandwiches in case their customers or their customers customers want them no matter how amazing ham is found to be for ones health  it doesnt make any sense youre still not understanding this not a law which requires jewish sandwich suppliers to supply ham sandwiches to their customers this is a law which requires the meat supplier to hand out ham to everyone who wants it  a jewish meat supplier should never be mandated to sell ham  its ridiculous  its against freedom of religiontheres no other way to spin it  a christian health insurer should likewise not be mandated to provide products it is against you as the employer arent providing health insurance you are taking a part of your employees salary and giving it to health insurance company in exchange for medication and medical procedures for your employees youre a mediator at best perhaps then the answer is for the employer to just stop offering insurance oh wait isnt the scenario here something like the church doesnt want to be forced to give out contraceptives which it believes are a sin to its employees dont these same employees usually share these beliefs as well how many church employees that your are aware of are atheists in a free market are they not able to seek employment elsewhere and really isnt this an issue of the gov not telling religion what to do gtdont these same employees usually share these beliefs as wellnot if the catholic church bought the formerly secular hospital you work at theyre a huge growing player in the health care industry and in a lot of areas theyre also the only player gtnot if the catholic church bought the formerly secular hospital you work ator even if it didnt most people are willing to work at a catholic hospital or school or other organization even if theyre not catholic the job market isnt so great that nonreligious people can choose to only work at secular organizations generally very good point if true however i thought they were dropping out of the whole hospital thing no gtvery good point if true however i thought they were dropping out of the whole hospital thing noquite the opposite they threatened to as a kind of ultimatum or like a yearolds temper tantrum depending on how you want to view it to this kind of legislation but i doubt they will one could only hope they dropped out of the hospital business it goes beyond not wanting to pay for insurance that covers birth control for their employees it affects many other health care decisions if the church doesnt like it then you dont get a choice gtisnt the scenario here something like the church doesnt want to be forced to give out contraceptivesthe church isnt giving out contraceptives the only thing obamacare does in this regard is that it requires health insurance policies to cover contraceptives for free so women have the choice to use them or not this is not forcing women to take contraceptives nor is it forcing churches to give out contraceptives but merrily saying contraceptives are to be included in healthcare insurance for women  well wait a sec there are things called riders your company pays for each coverage option they want contraceptives are no different as is maternity coverage nothing is free and insurance companies will not simply take the expense out of their pockets  contraceptives are very different than maternity coverage  insurance companies are happy to cover contraceptives because it is cheaper than maternity coveragetell your insurer you want to drop coverage for contraceptives  see if it makes premiums change birth controls actually lower costs because in the long term its a lot cheaper to pay for pills than for childbirth etc heres an article on it  we could just separate health insurance from employers completely and solve this in one go  gtno one is denying them the right to use it and contraception is certainly not an entitlement no but basic health care is an entitlement at least on this continent and bc pills arent always used for bc many prescription drugs have more than one use and bc is the same it can be used to lessen cramps worked wonders for me control acne and women with ovarian cysts need to take them too also i believe it is against the law to discriminate based on gender race religion or sexual orientation isnt it and denying birth control to women is discrimination based on gender and religion in a way too well said it provides several other services for them my gf has been on it ever since she could due to painful cramps which can be debilitating and other issues plus lets think about this a lot of this bc can limit periods to every  months or so this is a good thing for them as a man i would seek anything possible to limit monthly bleeding out of my penis that shit would suck it would work if medical expenses were not so high here that bc was cheap enough for the average person to buy off the shelf at this point healthcare coverage has to be an entitlement or youre screwed   the less acne was an example of an additional outcome of the medicine it does more than prevent pregnancy its a very welcome bonus of taking the medication for the other listed purposes what are the alternative treatmentsthe women in this thread and those like them are arguing that bc is should be welcome within their faith  of catholics are procontraceptive  gtbut an employer shouldnt have to pay for practices it doesnt agree withbut what if the employers religious beliefs contradict the religious beliefs of the employee how is that fair to the employee to have their religious liberties infringed upon by their employer the employee should get to decide if they want contraceptive coverage or not since the employer isnt going to be the one using it how does an employee using contraceptives violate the rights of the employer  an employees religious freedoms definitely should not be infringed upon by hisher employer and there are numerous legal protections for just that scenario and rightfully so but how does the health coverage issue violate any individual employees religious rights an employee using contraceptives does not violate any employers rights youre  percent correct but the issue is not the use of contraception its about who is paying for them  gtan employees religious freedoms definitely should not be infringed upon by hisher employer and there are numerous legal protections for just that scenario and rightfully soagreed gtan employee using contraceptives does not violate any employers rights youre  percent correct agreedgtits about who is paying for them true and i can see both sides the employer is already paying for the health insurance for the employee so in my mind  its easier to just require health insurance companies to cover contraceptives and leave it up to the employee if they want it or not which this is exactly how it is structured i honestly dont see what the big deal is as there are exceptions allowed to this requirement for religious institutions   they cant tell me what to do with my paycheck or my k  i dont see how insurance compensation is any different than any other compensation for employment  once the servicemoneysteak dinner is in my hands it is my choice how i use it  the employer is not paying for it if they are making profit off that worker then the worker is paying for it with work you the employer are merely taking advantage of govt programs in such a way as to offer less direct upfront compensation  gt  but an employer shouldnt have to pay for practices it doesnt agree withshould religious employers be exempt from minimum wage laws too  how about workplace safety laws  racial nondiscriminationthe privilege of employing people comes with certain responsibilities  if your religion forbids you from upholding those responsibilities then thats tough shitgt  of course i have a problem with the federal government even getting into the contraception debatedoes that go as far as opposing griswold v connecticuttoogt  we have bigger fish to fry in my opinionthis sounds like igmfy  access to basic health care is pretty fundamental and birth control is basic health care for  of the populationgo vote republican amp dont let the door hit your ass on the way out  who finds the plans affordable the whole obamacare effort is based on the facts that millions of americans cant afford health insurance and further exacerbate the overall cost by not getting checked up going to the emergency room at astronomical cost hacked and distributed to everybody else receiving symptom treatment and repeating the cycle  gt i am a libertarianif you subscribe to an igmfy philosophy then of course youre opposed to basic rights for other people and opposed to thisalso its natural that the rest of us would just ignore you  they arent providing the health care theyre providing the health care service they never have to hand anyone a birth control pill or even know that it was prescribed what you do with the service they provide you isnt any of their fucking business once theyve compensated me for my time what i do with said compensation is my choice would you make the same argument that they can dictate how i spend my paycheck if i work for a mormon employer can they deny me spending my income on alcohol or caffeine employer provided health insurance isnt coming directly from the employer it is compensation for my employment employers should not be dictating how employees spend their compensation gt dont these same employees usually share these beliefs as wellobviously not if they are asking for contraceptives its not typically the employees that are making a stink over this think the republicans jumped on the band wagon of yet another reason obamacare should be repealled although this sort of thing sounds more like a modification it highlights the changingprogressing role of big government this time with regard to religion gtits not typically the employees that are making a stink over thisthen the church really has nothing to complain about as someone who went to a jesuit university with actual written rules about not having sex and without access to birth control options it can be more than the employees who sign up to work at the institution it can be the students or customers as well i used to work for a catholic hospital i had coworkers who were muslim jewish and types of christian that dont have issues with bc my godmother worked for the same hospital and she is greek orthodoxthis is a case of one person being allowed to impose their religion on all of their employees because women think insurance should pay for their sexual lives every employer must provide said insurance  does no one understand that birth control is for more than just sex its fucking medicine what if you have ovarian cysts or endometriosdidnt spell that right but the point is still valid its not about paying for their sex lives its about having a valuable medication available for fucks sake i dont think its a lack of understanding thing they just dont think about itat all  they hear these sentiments from people they know and respect or from their favorite news organization and copy and paste the same illogical nonsense wherever they go  obviously anyone who thinks about this issue for more than  seconds realizes that funding birth control is a good idea and this is coming from a male republican   even if it was just for preventing pregnancy its still pretty damn important thank you for not being ignorant  even using that argument its cheaper to provide free birth control than to have the state support a child for the next  years   exactly why does no one else see that many do  the million dollar question is why some people dont think sensibly  they cling to stereotypes that fulfill their hate and could care less what problems it causes other people   yes we understand it calm down i have always defended private companies rights to not pay for birth control base on beliefs if birth control medication also happens to be a treatment for specific ailmentsconditions then i do not defend those companies aforementioned rights and if they the companies insist on denying birth control medication coverage for valid medical reasons then ill join you on the ramparts with a broken beer bottle in defense of womens right to equal treatment so i guess theyll stop covering viagra so we dont have to pay for mens sexual activities wow the viagra argument thats original theres a difference between inability to have sex and ability to have sex with no consequences  think of it like this  if a woman doesnt get pregnant the employer doesnt have to pay for maternity leave  also pregnancy requires a lot of healthcare while a birth control prescription usually only requires one fiveminute visit to the gyn per year  its a costsaving measure  and speaking as someone who has had to take birthcontrol for reasons other than contraception im pretty happy my insurance paid for it     youre giving me reasons why employers would want to pay for birth control which i agree with but the issue is whether companies who provide insurance must be forced by the government to include birth control such companies may place a higher premium no pun intended on certain beliefs than on the bottom line to lettersfromtheskys original question said companies are not dictating anyones sexual lives their employees are free to have all the sex they want but those companies dont want to fund it okay so your question is if government should be able to force employers who claim a religious exemption to pay for birth control anyway  yeah i think they should  the issue has been framed by the religious right as one of slutty young women who cant keep their legs closed wanting everybody else to pay for their orgasms  but pregnancy and pregnancy prevention are public health issues  married women and women who are in committed relationships want to be able to plan their pregnancies too  and lest we forget pregnancy impacts the lives of men pretty drastically  not to mention the lives of grandparents and other relatives who are often left to care for children born to young parents  they dont want to pay for my sex life  following that logic why give me any kind of pregnancy coverage  pregnancy is definitely part of my sex life  why give me maternity leave  all i did was spread my legs and now i get a paid vacation  or maybe theyll just deny coverage to women who arent married because it goes against their religious beliefs  religious exemptions are a slippery slope that i dont want to start down    sexuality can not be made distinct from life in general statisticians have consistently found that the availability and knowledge of contraceptives have no bearing on whether sex is being had or notbasically everybodys doing itbut if you want to take your slanted view to task it would be in the best interest of the employer to provide insurance more family planning is a real costsaving measure across the board it would be in everybodys best interest for contraceptives to be readily availableas the other commenters to this post have stated the insurance in question is medicine that keeps people or as you might see them workerssexhavers healthy and functioning again this is in everybodys best interest as i have stated in multiple other postsi agree that birth control is far far cheaper than not having it if i was a company id almost make it mandatory the issue is not the pros and cons of bc its the government mandating a private company provide benefits which are in direct opposition to its beliefsim talking about bc only bc medicine for other ailmentsconditions is fine with me by that i mean they should be mandated as covered theyre not saying were not covering bc so you wont have sex theyre saying were not subsidizingencouraging your sex which we know youre going to have but its on you not us the rightnesswrongness of that position is debatable i think its wrong but their right to have that position is whats in question we agreeoh we dont agree but on some stuff in application bc should be covered by all then even if its for having sex and preventing pregnancy that information clearly wont be shared between the employee and the employer a single christian women who works for a christian institution should have access to bc christians make decisions all the time that go against their no sex until marriage faith fallibility its still in the best interest of everybody involved or even not so involved that she avoids an unplanned pregnancy and any other of health risks i think its wrong too im a christian and every christian women ive spoken to and ive really tried to find someone that feels otherwise has vehemently expressed that it doesnt make them bad christians to require bc the churchs stance on being against bc is almost laughably antiquated except its not funny huh a church having antiquated views what are the odds of that lol i just said except its not funny come on man true i withdraw my lol and replace it with chuckles quietly to self its the choice of the business owner what benefits to provide nobody is forcing anyone to work at catholic institutions you can get birth control and condoms from walmart without much expense its not dictating other peoples choices its choosing to not fund their choices theres a difference gtits the choice of the business owner what benefits to provideexcept that its often the health insurance companies that decide what they will and wont cover the employer just chooses a plan if you ask me thats not much a choice gtnobody is forcing anyone to work at catholic institutionstrue but this goes beyond religious institutions and is expanded to include the religious beliefs of secular employers gtits not dictating other peoples choices its choosing to not fund their choices theres a differenceso how does an employee wanting contraceptives covered on their health insurance plan provided by the employer infringe upon the employer given that the employer isnt using the contraceptives  im not sure how birth control and condoms come in handy when a woman is raped by a coworker and cant afford a  abortion birth control might probably not the condoms though im pretty sure planned parenthood would take care of that and its not hard to get community support for a victim in that circumstancegtraped by a coworkerim pretty sure there would be some liability on the employers part you can get birth control and condoms from walmart without much expensethen you wont mind if i send you my bill if you need people to support you send the bill to your parents  how do you find time to grow all that food while still maintaining all the roads and electrical lines you require to live and still manage to post on the internet that you created and maintained   easy i have a job which i use the income from to pay for food my taxes go toward maintaining the road and other infrastructure i also use money from said job to buy condoms i would recommend you get an education and a job it helps when you want to buy things as a last resort though you could just stand on a roadside corner and beg so what you are saying that if we want something to be provided we should tax to pay for it like roads and other infrastructure kind of like what we just did with health care  unless of course walmart sells it for cheap  that is really good news for the budget we can just get rid of medicare prescriptions because hey walmart has a pharmacy  im confused on how you think you have a rational argument but dont let that stop you from attempting a witty comment at the end   gtso what you are saying that if we want something to be provided we should tax to pay for it like roads and other infrastructure no thats what youre saying im saying we use money from jobs to buy it unless its something everyone will use like a road for examplegtkind of like what we just did with health care evidently it must have slipped past you that the aca isnt a single payer systemgtim confused im not surprised so making someone pay for their own abortions is dictating their sexual lives contraceptives  abortions  are you being intentionally obtuse or are you really that dopey of course this is about abortion if its not than you are telling me paying for your own rubbers and birth control pills is dictating someones sexual lives gtof course this is about abortioneven if this was about abortion women have the right to do it because they have the right to control their own bodies and reproductive organ how would you feel if the government passed a law preventing you from ejaculating outside of a vagina if youre willing to use government to regulate what women can or cant do with their vagina than you must be okay with government regulating what you can or cant do with your penis right or do you believe youre exempt from having your penis regulated by government because you just happen to be a man and not a women if you believe this then why do you believe women should have their reproductive organ regulated by the government do you believe in liberty freedom personal responsibility and small government how does using government to regulate womens vaginas align with those beliefs gtare you being intentionally obtuse or are you really that dopey neither  gtif youre willing to use government to regulate what women can or cant do with their vagina than you must be okay with government regulating what you can or cant do with your penis rightso you really are dopey nobody is outlawing abortion not paying for something someone wants is not prohibiting it as far as i know abortions arent being covered in the mandate nor are birth control pills carrying out abortions in any way even the morningafter pill serves to keep a pregnancy from taking place conception can take several hoursmore than a day after intercourse takes place in case there is a malfunction with a condom or a slipup with bc scheduling or any other possibility there are legal medications that will terminate a pregnancy that early on but i dont believe those are covered in the mandate either what did you imagine the catholics were up in arms about red meat on  fridays  nope they fixed thatevolution being taught  nope they fixed thatheliocentrism  nope they even apologized to galileo for that only  years latercondoms to prevent disease  nope just woke up to that onewhatever it is i am sure they will see the light soon enough selectively covering some procedures and medications and not others is certainly strongly encouraging certain behavior in certain areas of ones life nothe point is employers dont get to select what healthcare benefits their employees receive because the employer doesnt like certain medical procedures jehovas witnesses cant deny employees coverage for blood transfusions believers in prayerhealing cant deny employees coverage for everything but prayer healers and voodoopracticing followers of chumba gunga the great earth god cant deny employees access to all treatment except that administered by a witch doctors employers to not get to direct access to care of employees conversely the point of insurance is to protect against unforeseen catastrophic health issues sex and normal pregnancy are not unforeseen this is nothing more than a political wedge issue designed to herd legions of the dumb masses to vote for the party that believes more government is good i hoping where when romney this the blog reeks astroturfing smear campaign i fan romney i fan unsourced reporting were currently  comment threads from the top and yours is the first voice of reason to chime in so far i also am waiting for the bibliography before i start spreading this rumour around the coffee table if the blog leans left it counts as a source around these parts this blog isnt just leaning left  it has fallen into the water left  while i prefer to read unbiased articles which are rare it is sometimes pleasing to read a slightly left leaning article  this one just goes a little too far for me  i do not like how it starts off praising obama and then all of a sudden gtmitt romney and fox news on the other hand i mean come on this isnt a fifth grade paper were writing i enjoy reading articles about both parties but the moment i see the link start with moveonorg or thinkprogressorg i dont even bother it looks like a tea party article written from the other side  identifying the reader as part of the group while providing no citation as president i will follow a very different path than president obama i will be a staunch defender of religious freedom the obamacare regulation is not a threat and insult to only one religious group  it is a threat and insult to every religious group as president i will abolish itmitt april  nra speechits not like its a secret that mitt wants to abolish something he was all for during his tenure as mass gov and that wasnt a news article it was an opinion piece at least thats what i took it as the lack of links was annoying alternet isnt where you go for fair and balanced see what i did there reporting by any means though they wear their leanings on their sleeves additionally from the above quote its funny what mitt thinks of religious freedom for some no churches will be required to provide contraception by the way yet another unearned bonus for those societal leeches   governor romney supports the blunt bill because he believes in a conscience exemption in health care for religious institutions and people of faithandrea saul romney spokespersonin a public memo from the campaign dated february emphasis mine feel free to lexisnexus that yeah i toooootally understand downvoting citations in response to someone wanting citations unless it just doesnt jive with a particular narrative about liberal media why outlaw intercourse guys much easier to outlaw adultery  thus promoting marriage for sex and procreation abstinence for the nonmarried and punishment for people who have sex when they shouldnt according to puritanical rules something like  us states still have adultery laws on the books according to wikipedia you can get a life sentence in michigan lock me up and throw away the key adultery is the way for me in north dakota i couldnt get an apartment with my girlfriend because we werent married glad to leave that shithole  there was a post a while ago about the same situation in mass iirc thats effing ridiculous maybe we should go further from there  every man should have a camera attached to their penis with the purpose of making sure every ejaculation emitted by the man is going into a vagina if you are caught ejaculating outside of a vagina you are fined or sent to jail nah  only women can have their reproductive stuff legislated  if we tried to do it to men it would be terrifying big government when are womens reproductive organs legislated be careful now give me a rational response  how about that virginia law that required a transvaginal ultrasound before getting an abortion to give one example this bill in not outlawing anything this bill does not go against freedom of religion at all i personally disagree with the bill but the title of this thread and the general response of most comments really makes me question the intelligence of this community  that would be unbiblical be fruitful and multiple and all that jazz haha i read that as all my jizz same thing really can explain denying freedom religion honest question isnt romneys argument employer fronting bill health coverage they therefore forced spend their money they consider immoral based their religious beliefs if anything upholding freedom religion gt  isnt it upholding freedom of religionno while you are correct in pointing out that the title is misleading because he is not denying freedom of religion you conclusion about the relationship between employer expenses and religious beliefs is faultyemployers do not foot the bill for health insurance it is compensation for employee labor therefore it is paid by the employees via the employer to attain group discount pricing the employer is not footing the bill for the same reason that walmart is not footing the health insurance bill for target employeesand even if you want to ignore that fact the employer is not purchasing health care insurance not the health care itself and this can be taken once step further and the insurer is not purchasing the health care either the employee is purchasing the contraceptives using funds from the pools resource that is health care insurancethis issue is nothing more than right wing nut baggery that requires ignoring multiple levels of separation in the transaction between an individual and their pharmacy neither the employer nor the insurer are actually purchasing contraceptives they are providing a pooled resource service that is allbased on the faulty logic used to deny employees their right to make their own personal health care decisions an employer could also deny paying wages on the basis of the employee potentially using their paycheck to purchase products or services that the employer finds religiously objectionable employers could set up their own towns and town stores and churches and require employees to live the life the company owner deems is morally acceptable for their religious preferenceif this is such a butt hurt issue for the religious right then there are two simple solutions a accept a single payer government system paid for with taxes that will further separate them from any health care decisions they find objectionable or b eliminate all employer health care plans and give the compensation dollars directly to the employees to they can make their own decision on how to spend their hard earned money instead of relying on the morality of the company owners to decide on how the laborers should spend their compensation gtemployers do not foot the bill for health insurance it is compensation for employee labor therefore it is paid by the employees via the employer to attain group discount pricing the employer is not footing the bill for the same reason that walmart is not footing the health insurance bill for target employeesin the us employers pay approximately  of the costs of employerprovided insuranceemployers who use pool insurance pay around  into the pool and that money goes directly to pay for prescriptions and medical servicesim not quite sure what you mean when you say that employers do not foot the bill for health insurance  the fact that benefits are part of a compensation package for labor does not mean employers do not pay for those compensation packagesgtemployers could set up their own towns and town stores and churches and require employees to live the life the company owner deems is morally acceptable for their religious preferenceexcept that nobody is requiring employees to be limited to the employerprovided insurance  supplemental insurance is available to anyonemoreover what youre describing is precisely what the government does with regards to employees who serve in the armed forces overseas  all your stores and churches and the manner in which you live your life is dictated by your employer the federal government gt in the us employers pay approximately  of the costs of employerprovided insurancethat  is employee compensation the employees work for that employer payment no different from the payment received in cash it is not free money out of the good will of the corporationgt  the fact that benefits are part of a compensation package for labor does not mean employers do not pay for those compensation packagesexactly it is compensation what it means is that it is earned by the employee no different from wages the lease a corporation pays on a building is a straight up bill the company foots the portion paid into a health insurance plan is agreed upon compensation for labor performed by the employeegt except that nobody is requiring employees to be limited to the employerprovided insuranceoh but they are the health insurance payment is earned compensation the employee is owed for their labor if the employee finds that the religiously restricted health insurance plan their employer wants to purchase with the employees compensation is not acceptable for their own belief system or lack of belief do you think the employer will hand over that compensation and allow the employee to decide for themselves how to spend it in the health insurance marketi am sure both you and i know that the employer will not hand over the compensation but instead will keep that earned compensation if the employee will not  accept the religiously restricted health insurance plangt what youre describing is precisely what the government does with regards to employees who serve in the armed forces overseasi am not sure where you are going with this military personnel overseas is a rather unique circumstance that in no way describes how government employment and compensation works in generalgt  all your stores and churches and the manner in which you live your life is dictated by your employer the federal governmenti have to call bullshit on this statement from my understanding the military actually goes out of its way to make accommodations to satisfy the belief systems of the soldiers employees rather than the other way around and they pay earnings in dollars that can be used off base however the soldier employee sees fit rather than telling the soldier how their compensation must be spent im not sure this follows from what i understand a lot of employer based insurance came about when the government stopped them from raising wages to match inflation all the time so they use benefits to compensate if i lost my benefits i would want to be paid more and without benefits or with me paying my own insurance i would be happy to find a company that would compensate me better for my skills if my current employer wouldnt gt im not sure this followswhat follows what you didnt contradict or dispute anythinggt  the government stopped them from raising wages to match inflation all the time so they use benefits to compensateam i correct in assuming this is sarcasmedit or perhaps you are talking about the wage and price controls implemented in  those controls were phased out after the war there have been no limits on wage increases since around and the employer based insurance did not come about simply because it was eliminated as part of the wage controls employer based insurance has a long history that precedes world war ii and while the wage controls decision may have increased the popularity during the war the practice continued after the wage controls were removed and it was popularized by other groups ie the labor unions hear hear ill take a single payer system please  thank you for thisedit a man cant show his appreciation for a well thought out comment without getting downvoted fuck you reddit this may sound like a dumb question but why are employers the one providing health insurance in the first place a very long and boring history dating back to soldiers coming back from world war ii wage controls a bunch of reform in the s etc etcits a link that needs to be broken in my opinion not a dumb question at all  hell its one of the main reasons why health care in this country is a mess  i personally think that individuals should be able to deduct their own personal health care plans so that they dont have to tie their insurance to their job especially in this economy with high unemployment if you do that then you introduce adverse selection some form of pooling is necessary gt  i personally think that individuals should be able to deduct their own personal health care plansindividuals are in fact able to deduct their own personal health care plans yup  thats what i thought  if you force a company to provide birth control to their employees youre denying the companys owners their freedom to operate as they pleaseif a company doesnt pay for its employees birth control the employees still have the freedom to purchase it for themselvesin this particular instance romney is profreedom even if its antilabor its not their money the worker is working and expecting to get medical coverage and its their labor that is the only reason their can be medical coverage for them this is why single payer makes way more sense you pay one rate and everyone gets the standard level of care the care you want and not the care someone else imposes on you which i hope we can all agree is morally reprehensible to deny anyone medical coverage because of someone elses religious views you know thats a dangerous path to go down gtits not their money the worker is working and expecting to get medical coverage and its their labor that is the only reason their can be medical coverage for themthis is incorrect  employees exchange their labor in exchange for consideration namely a salary benefits and yes health care coverage  that consideration is paid to the employee by the employer in a mutually agreed upon arrangement  that doesnt change anything of what was said prior though the employer is funding care and therefore still has the right to choose what is and is not offered in exchange for their labor do they not  again assuming that these decisions are not made in the middle of a coverage term illegal btw the agreement is consensualif an employer has a religious objection to funding certain things in this case contraception how exactly is the state mandating that they fund said coverage not a violation of religious liberty  the issue cuts both ways does it notgtthis is why single payer makes way more sense you pay one rate and everyone gets the standard level of care the care you want and not the care someone else imposes on you which i hope we can all agree is morally reprehensible to deny anyone medical coverage because of someone elses religious views you know thats a dangerous path to go downi do agree that this is a good reason that tying health care to employment is faulty  however i think tying it to the government is equally faulty  you have a highly ideological view of single payer i think  be it the government or be it a private employer whenever someone else is funding your health care that same entity retains the right to put restrictions and qualifications on said care  the idea that the government is immune from ideological restrictions of care is optimistic at best gtthe issue cuts both ways does it notit should but it sure as hell doesnt on rpolitics gtif an employer has a religious objection to funding certain things in this case contraception how exactly is the state mandating that they fund said coverage not a violation of religious liberty the issue cuts both ways does it notthe same way making religion a protected class isnt a violation of religious liberty  the rights of the employer and the employee are being considered and this is a protection of the employees right to religious liberty rather than the employers  the regulation has proven necessary because of the chronic abuse of workers rights by employers throughout the united statesthe reason workers rights need to be protected above the rights of the employer is because theres an inherently uneven distribution of power between workers and employers  the employees protected by mandating contraception be available through employer health care plans often have no ability to negotiate their contract and are likely forced to accept whatever employment they can get  its little different than collective bargaining on the part of employees nationwideit seems fuzzier on this specific topic because birth control is something that you can go without if necessary but apply the same logic to refusing to fund blood transfusions surgery or modern medical care of any kind   the government is not immune to ideology but everyone gets to weigh in  at least more so than leaving it up to billy bob biblethumper as to what conditions get covered and which dont gtthe employer is funding care and therefore still has the right to choose what is and is not offered in exchange for their labor do they notno because health insurance providers are now legally obligated to cover birth control for all new policy holders speaking ideologically hence the reaction to mitt romneys proposal not all employers foot the entirety of health care coverage where i work i have group coverage from my employer which helps lower the rate but i still pay for the vast majority of the coverage  in that light how is your argument any different than an employee blowing their money on prostitutes and alcohol freedom of religion also means freedom from religion anytime religion is used as the deciding factor in whether something should be legal or not in a secular arrangement like employment than you are necessarily infringing on someone elses freedom of religion gt anytime religion is used as the deciding factor in whether something should be legal or not in a secular arrangement like employment than you are necessarily infringing on someone elses freedom of religionabsolutely rightexcept nobody is talking about making contraception illegal  nobody is suggesting that employees be prohibited from taking contraception  whats being discussed is whether the employer should be forced to pay for it  nothing more no you ignored the first half of my post as i said not all employers pay for  of health coverage my employer pays significantly less of my health coverage than i pay out of pocket but they do provide a group plan which helps lower rateswhat were discussing is whether birth control should be in the same class of drugs like viagra drugs that are covered under health insurance nothing more then dont work at a company that wouldnt give you proper medical insurance coverage when going through the hiring process you are always capable of figuring out what your company covers andor doesnt it wouldnt make sense to accept a job offer at a place that wouldnt properly cover you and then complain about it later if what youre saying is correct then ill gladly convert to jainism  now wheres my refund for the iraq and afghan wars since funding war would go against my religious beliefs what about employers that dont contribute to the health care programs they offer not all employers pay for their employee health insurance programs no you cant deny women their basic rights and pretend its about your religious freedom if you dont like birth control dont use it religious freedom doesnt mean you can force others to live by your own beliefs yes even if the employee is paying the insurer directly the presumption is the employers contribution is reducing the cost of the contraceptive to the woman the republican argument is of course just find work elsewhere  gtthat an employer is fronting the bill for health coveragebut theyre not theyre contributing to an employees health insurance premium a premium buys insurance insurance pays the cost of medical careregardless of if that care is more or less of what the premium was its not a direct transfer of money typically first of all it should be noted that for larger organizations thinking of catholic hospitals specifically that selfinsure up until their stoploss insurance they would be directly funding these things which creates an issue as im sure we can all agreenow for organizations that dont do the above its not a direct transfer of money from employertocontraception that much is true but they are still funding something that they consider to be immoral via the purchasing of a plan that covers certain things  the issue here is whether they have a right to provide coverage to their employees for things that they do consider to be moral without the offending coverages which an employee is then free to cover in some other waykeep in mind that this discussion is not whether an employer can dictate to an employee that they are prohibited from taking contraception  everyone agrees that would be illegal  the issue here is whether the employer should then be forced to offer and therefore fund a plan that provides this coverage that they consider to be immoral  you can disagree with their stance on the morality of contraception but isnt romneys point here that your beliefs that birth control is ok does not obligate someone who disagrees with you to then fund that coverage if they self insure your premiums are still set aside into a separate fund its like they are running their own insurance company it is in an insurance companys best interest to cover birth control because if they dont cover it a certain percentage of women who would have been taking it are going to opt not to pay for it out of pocket and end up pregnant unintentionally which will cost the insurance company a lot more than the pills about  times  month of the pill in other words covering the pill will probably not change the cost of the plan if the cost does change it will probably go down slightly so the employer isnt actually paying extra to cover it insurance is part of an employees compensation package unfortunately if an employee decides to opt out of the insurance offered by the employer perhaps because it doesnt cover certain things the employer contribution is not given to the employee as such the employers plan is really the only viable option for most people because the only other option is to opt out and find their own insurance out of whats left of their significantly reduced compensation package this is extremely close to paying people who do not share your religious beliefs less money and not just a little bit less money my employer tells me that they pay  of my premiums i still pay mo so even if i could get the same coverage for the same price on an individual plan highly unlikely i would have  less per month to spend on living expenses than other people who are getting paid the same  gtif they self insure your premiums are still set aside into a separate fund its like they are running their own insurance companythis is incorrect but the nature of stoploss insurance isnt really the debate heregtit is in an insurance companys best interest to cover birth control because if they dont cover it a certain percentage of women who would have been taking it are going to opt not to pay for it out of pocket and end up pregnant unintentionally which will cost the insurance company a lot more than the pills about  times  month of the pill in other words covering the pill will probably not change the cost of the plan if the cost does change it will probably go down slightly so the employer isnt actually paying extra to cover it this is a practical not ideological objection though  yeah financially speaking it probably does make more sense to cover contraception  thats great  what does that have to do with religious liberty though  you can make a great case for why it should be covered but if someone disagrees with the coverage on a religious means is that not their rightwhat it really boils down to is this  if an insurance company is willing to offer a religious organization or any organization with a religious objection to contraception for that matter an employer plan at a certain price presumably a higher premium for the reasons you note that is consistent with their religious morals then how is it not a violation of religious liberty to say to someone sorry your religious beliefs are irrelevant you have to fund this whether you agree with it or not i would agree if the employer had to pay out what they would have otherwise contributed to the insurance premiums when an employee opts out thus giving the employee a more fair chance to shop around on the open market for birth control this seems quite silly as it only costs about month but if you allow catholics to not cover the pill are you going to allow jehovahs witnesses to not cover blood transfusions that would be a problem for a lot of people so where do you draw the line yes if an organization was run by jehovahs witnesses i would consider them well within their rights to not fund a health care plan that provides blood transfusionsif that were at all available  its their money they should be able to offer whatever benefits they choose to its as much their money as the money they pay you in your check each month health insurance is part of your compensation package if your salary is k per year your employer does not look at you as costing kyear they take your salary they add their insurance contribution they add their payroll tax contribution they add their retirement plan contributions if they offer them if they offer any freebies or discounts to employees those will also be added in this is considered your compensation package your compensation package it is part of your pay and these organizations want to be able to dictate based on their religious beliefs how their employees are able to take advantage of something the employees bought with their own money  should they be able to deny covering aids treatment because of their stance on homosexuality and the stigma surrounding aids if not then who decides where the line gets drawn and if it is being drawn without illegal bias it seems to me that romneys argument is that anyone should be allowed to offer an insurance policy to their employees consistent with their religious beliefs  thats the very nature of freedom of religion is it not  if that means that the insurance policy they choose to offer doesnt offer contraceptive coverage thats their right  if that means the insurance policy that they choose to offer doesnt include hiv medication thats their rightnow the term deny covering in your question is a bit confusing  if hiv treatment is covered by a plan that they offer an employer can not say no no no i dont want to cover that for this employee because they are gay  an insurance policy is a contract after all and coverage should be provided consistent with that contract  what we are discussing is whether the employer should have the right to choose a policy that does not cover certain things they consider to be immoral gtit seems to me that romneys argument is that anyone should be allowed to offer an insurance policy to their employees consistent with their religious beliefs this means an employer can go my religion says you cant go to a doctor you must pray no coverage for you oh look i saved a huge heap of money uh plenty of employers just dont provide coverage at all and they pay fees for doing such not yet and i think not ever if theyre small enough yea and yes it does assuming theres a religion out there that shuns doctors and as frogtodd says thats the very nature of freedom of religion what everyone else wants here is for employees to have freedom of religion to the detriment of their employersnot only does this protect the freedom of religion of employers it also has no impact on the employees freedom of religion they can still go out and buy birth control if they wantman rights suck when they dont agree with your political stance it has nothing to do with my political stance it in no way effects you if someone who works for you wants to use birth control to hide behind religious beliefs as a way to save a few bucks on health insurance so they cant use birth control is pathetic and laughable  gtit in no way effects you if someone who works for you wants to use birth controlit does if youre paying for it and the price is  a month and eternal damnationyou seem to think that people only have religious beliefs because it saves them a dollar or two some people have sincerelyheld religious beliefs and what youre proposing is limiting their freedom to exercise those beliefs because you dont want to pay for your own birth controltldr youre still advocating for limits on religious freedom regardless of how you try to frame it no im advocating not being allowed to discriminate against people if that limits your freedom so be it you dont deserve it anyway  christian scientists dont believe in modern medicine they pray for healing  okay then the answer is yes then you go purchase your own insurance problem solved  youre assuming you can purchase your own insurance  i am assuming that because the employer doesnt have the insurance bill to foot that other comparable companies would you most likely would receive a higher wage than at the company offering insurance this would help offset the increased cost of buying personal insurance and if buying personal insurance is so much more expensive than employer sponsored insurance than that means employers are paying a large portion of your insurance bill if i am in a mutual agreement in which i have a large stake in ownership i expect to have some say so in its contents  hey i hope you see this frog the general problem legally isnt necessarily freedom of religion it is the idea of providing equal healthcare to everyone there really isnt an equivalent to men when it comes to a pill you take daily so many christians say that because of this equal healthcare does not include birth control i am sure that if a company offers no healthcare they do not have to provide birth control options because they are offering equal healthcare even if it is no healthcareunfortunately many people dont really realize that its not as black and white as religion interfering with other peoples lives its not easy at all to say what constitutes equal healthcare men and women are different and there will never be a way to find a  equal for everything i personally believe that birth control should be considered fairly necessary as it does many other things rather than just prevent conception i also lean this way because many people who are against it use the she just wants to be a whore argument which has no logical basis that would be like saying i want ibprofin only to get drunk and wake up without a bad hangover yes i can use it that way but it is also good for many other thingsin the end the legal reasons are different than the emotional reasons anti birth control people cite freedom of religion pro birth control cite this doesnt constitute religious freedom to deny something most people use and that is religion controlling nonreligious in reality it is an argument on what constitutes equal healthcare its an interesting position  i dont believe that the moral objection to birth control is necessarily antiwoman  further the idea that it shouldnt be provided is because women would be whores with iti is horrid  thats terrifically offensive and anyone who would say that should be ashamed of themselves  i certainly would never say that  that said im not sure i agree that denying the pill is a violation of equal healthcare especially in the moral context that we are discussing  theoretically the same people that argue the freedom of religion to employers funding certain care would likewise uphold the religious freedom of an employer not to provide coverage for say vasectomies which are likewise considered immoral in certian christian circles i agree i would not consider that it has to be antiwoman but many supporters of denying birthcontrol such as karl rove i know he isnt the smartest example but still say that the only reason to be against denying birth control only do so out of sexual reasonsneedswhorishness rove went so far as to say that the women who are against the conservative motion must take so many birth control pills from all the sex they have with random partnerseither way the idea of equal healthcare is tough because men and women are different what makes it harder is when people confuse this as a purely religious topic either way war on women hurrrrrrrrrrrr durrrrrrr the answer to your last question no unless they can provide justification for their view outside of a religious context then their opinion should have no bearing on the lives of other people doctors medical professionals fuck even the insurance companies should have more of a say in their medical policy about someone who just feels like something is immoral or who just read a book from  years ago which sort of if you look at it backwards and upsides down supports the view could you imagine how even more fucked up and complicated the job market will get if you have to consider what each insurance policy of each place you apply to will cover insurance companies want to pay for it because the cost of an unwanted child is much higher and that cost gets put onto everyone else in the system so just because this asshole doesnt want to pay for it now all of our rates will go up because now theres a shitload of unwanted kids around exaggeration for effect someone who has no training no background in medicine or in health coverage should not be determining what is the best things for insurance to cover i seriously dont even understand why this is even an issue you are applying two different standards as if they were one  the objection to contraception here is not practical it is not an attack on the efficacy of birth control or whether it is safe  the objection is moral  they have a moral objection to contraception therefore they have a moral objection to funding and providing contraception to others  saying yeah but its really awesome and insurance companies really want to pay for it and it lowers costs in the long run is irrelevant when discussing the moral objection that they haveyou can disagree with that thats totally cool  that is your right  what is not your right is to impose your views that contraception is moral on others that disagree with you and then mandate that they fund your activity  an employee is more than free to pay for their own contraception medication and an employer can do absolutely nothing about that but where the objection comes in is with the ides that the employer must therefore fund it and provide it for the employee but you cant just go around claiming moral objections to things with out an actual argument against those things and this case the argument is solely based on religion in my view that should be discounted when talking politics your moral objection to it means that you personally should not use it it says nothing about whether other people should and it is imposing those beliefs onto others who work there who arent of the same beliefs  yes you own the company you dont not own the people you do not operate in a bubble outside of society you are paying your employees who spend that money on tons of things that you might morally object to but somehow in regards to birth control god is so easily tricked and fooled into thinking you arent paying for their birth control when the reality is you are by paying th em anything you are unavoidably supporting somethings that you morally object to this is illogical irrational and it just serves to push your beliefs onto your employees gtbut you cant just go around claiming moral objections to things with out an actual argument against those things and this case the argument is solely based on religion  in my view that should be discounted when talking politicsdiscounted  we have an innate freedom to ennumerated directly by the constitution  how can we possibly say that freedom should be discounted  its literally the same thing as saying the right to free speech should be discounted when discussing politics  its even the same ammendmentgtyour moral objection to it means that you personally should not use it it says nothing about whether other people shouldand again nobody is arguing whether other people should at least not here  i  agree with you that dont like it dont do it dont tell others wha they can and cant do  no argument  the issue is whether they should be forced to directly pay for it on their behalfgtyou are paying your employees who spend that money on tons of things that you might morally object to but somehow in regards to birth control god is so easily tricked and fooled into thinking you arent paying for their birth control when the reality is you are by paying th em anything you are unavoidably supporting somethings that you morally object to this is illogical irrational and it just serves to push your beliefs onto your employeestheres a fundamental difference between heres what we pay you and here we have funded this directly for you on your behalffor example  were we to switch to some hsa system where employees pretax income was put in to a savings account used exclusively for health care expenses which some companies do already and employees then used those funds for contraception the objections would be as severe  the issue is the mandated direct funding of said coverage that becomes the issueim actually guessing this will be increasingly common as a workaround actually well to address the end no i dont think there is a difference my health insurance comes from my paycheck it doesnt come from a separate pool of cash about the beginning a religious argument as no room in politics its unproven its unprovable it implies that it takes faith to accept it legislating based on it is forcing people to accept a belief that they might not accept the justification of faith isnt strong enough  if there is something worth doing in politics you need to find an argument to support it based on evidence logic history etc something that can be demonstrable otherwise you just end up using loaded words to trick people into agreeing with you  i dont really think this is too controversial there is indeed a separation of church and state in this country part of its purpose is to make sure people arent forcing their religious beliefs onto others so how exactly is legislating based on a religious belief not forcing that belief onto others that might not accept that religion as valid  gtdiscounted we have an innate freedom to ennumerated directly by the constitution how can we possibly say that freedom should be discounted its literally the same thing as saying the right to free speech should be discounted when discussing politics its even the same ammendmentyeah how dare they say you cant shout fire in a crowded theater that would discount your right to free speech there are no limits on your rightsexcept when they harm others and in this case i believe you could make a case for harmgtand again nobody is arguing whether other people should at least not here i  agree with you that dont like it dont do it dont tell others wha they can and cant do no argument the issue is whether they should be forced to directly pay for it on their behalfyou and many others seem to be confusing the entity of a company with the person running the company the money in the company is not the head of the companys nor can it be for tax purposes  the companys money is paying for these treatments not the owner when you decide to limit your liability a limitation on your rights doesnt seem unfair the cases where someone is directly employed by an individual are rare and health care is likely not offered companies are not people my friend contraception is not a fundamental tenet of any religionwhy do employers get more rights than employeesfreedom of speech has restrictions  so does freedon of religioncontraception prevents pregnancy and some forms of cancer  it will probably reduce the cost of the plan since those things are really expensive to pay for  so they are forced to pay lessdont really get how that is badstop telling people with other religions what is right or wrong  an employer has no right to discriminate against women nor control their behavior  it is pretty sick that anyone would even argue for this the thing is the bill of rights does not apply when it comes to private companies by forcing companies to comply with what the government thinks is morally right the government violates the constitutiondo i think companies should provide all the same things you want in their health insurance plans absolutely but it doesnt mean that the government should have the power to mandate those things just think what if it was the other way around and the government mandated all companies to stop providing those services we wouldnt like that in keeping with the logic most of these posters have exhibited lets pass a new law if any secondary school provides lunch options they must provide pork products every day orthodox jewish and muslim schools includedboooo hooo booo hoooo  theyre violating my first amendment of religious freedom by refusing to buy me something they believe to be wrong then buy your logic the employer could follow you around and tell you when you could buy and not buy with your pay check false equivalence look it up how about we just cut out the employer and pay for healthcare at a federal level nope that isnt freedom of religion at all  freedom of religion means that you can believe in whatever religion you wish and the government will not interfere  religious employers telling insurance companies what to cover is imposing their religion on others and discriminating against other religions of their employees that do not have archaic restrictionswhat you are arguing is because an employer holds religious beliefs he gets to impose those beliefs on others  so if they believe in mandatory prayer every hour they can force their employees to pray just because they pay them  an employer can not control their employees beliefsso telling them they cant have something because of their beliefs is not freedom of religion  employers also pay for dental insurance  should the employer dictate that they can only go to dentists that share the employers belief  of course not it is none of the employers business gtreligious employers telling insurance companies what to coveryou are misunderstanding the issue im afraid  nobody is telling insurance companies what to cover  companies are the customers of group insurance providers  they taylor plans in accordance with what the companies want  an employer can ask for certain coverages of an insurance provider the same way that you can choose whether physical damage coverage is included as part of your auto insurance or notgtwhat you are arguing is because an employer holds religious beliefs he gets to impose those beliefs on othersquite the opposite actually  i dont believe anyone should be able to enforce their religious beliefs or lack thereof on anyone else and that includes forcing someone to fund something they find to be immoral  it seems to me that you are the one that wants to impose beliefs on othersgttelling them they cant have something because of their beliefs is not freedom of religion nobody is suggesting that they should be able to say you cant use birth control  what i am saying is they should be able to say i wont pay for that  if you want it you can pay for it yourself easy  look up the theory of public accommodation   thats whyno american business is an isolated island unto itself   the american business environment is based on generations of americans who have paid taxes built the countrys infrastructure and  died in wars defending it  the american people also created this countrys currency that these business use  more accurately   they back up the promissory notes with the promise of future blood and toil thus upholding the currencys current valuebased on how often your question is repeated here in this thread and how well your question is upvoted it is clear that the ayn rand brand of sociopathy has trickleddown into every aspect of this society     its like we dont even have a country or society  frankly this stance from you amp your ilk is not sustainable  and will only result in utter barbarism  violence and death  and ultimately there will be no country or even free market left for your ilk to defendfrankly  you amp your ilk are actually attacking this country and helping to destroy it  no better than if you were agents of a hostile foreign government   i think they should be able to deny coverage for whatever they want  there doesnt need to be a line drawnshit some employers dont provide any insurance at allfyi most employers will deny covering aids treatment if you attempt to kill yourself by deliberately infecting yourself with hiv  not covering medical treatments necessitated by suicide attempts is a restriction most employers have based on moral some would say religious principlesmany people with insurance rack up hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of medical bills following suicide attempts i dont think so but how does that prove the denying freedom of religion claim religion has no place in the employeeemployer relationship to begin with and should not affect the type of coverage you receive  i agree completely but how is that denying freedom of religion well it does seem to be a stretch as it more comes out as freedom to not be subjected to the moralsreligious beliefs of your employer so i suppose if someone is going to use that argument they need knowledge or proof that it is being done for religious reasonsits being protected from others beliefs more than it is protection of your beliefs i suppose it should get drawn wherever the fuck they want to draw it if you dont like it find a different insurer actually religious organizations run a lot of aids hospices shelters home care and other programs to help those with hivaids im not a member of any churches but ive volunteered at quite a few shelters and hospices and it seems to me most of them have intense involvement and volunteer support from people of various faithsheres a few programs from the first page of google hits as far as i know no religion says you should deny someone else access to somethingit is all about how you live your life not others if with free will they chose to sin it is none of your business even if you give them the money to do it withif you pay taxes you contribute to a military that is designed to kill people effectively all killing is a sin gtas far as i know no religion says you should deny someone else access to somethinggtit is all about how you live your life not others if with free will they chose to sin it is none of your businessvery true  and again nobody is arguing that a religious employer should be able to fire laypeople clergy is a different matter for decisions in their personal life  where it becomes their business is the conscripted direct funding of that specific activity  to use the oftcited pork example a kosher deli employer cant prevent you from using your paycheck to buy a sausagebut you cant force them to make you a ham sandwich for lunch eithergtif you pay taxes you contribute to a military that is designed to kill people effectively all killing is a sina very good point hence the reason that singlepayer wouldnt solve the issue in the slightest youd just move from employer making decisions for me to government making decisions for me all my paychecks go to sinyour sandwich involves the employer making something  an act of involvement  participationthere are many things your hypothetical christian employer already provides for you that goes against hisher religioncloth of multiple fibers flame retardant for exampleaccess to funds for education evolutionary biology on offerwork on the sabbath for otpork among many other unclean foods on offer in

law of the land aca is the law you may find some of it immoral for you but you are not forced to do those thingsthere is the truly absolute option  stop your business shut up shop that is your right then you wont have anything to worry aboutbefore you say that is going too far consider the quakers and similar gtthere are many things your hypothetical christian employer already provides for you that goes against hisher religiongtcloth of multiple fibers flame retardant for examplegtaccess to funds for education evolutionary biology on offergtwork on the sabbath for otgtpork among many other unclean foods on offer in their restaurants stores and employee lunch programs leviticus tells christians they shouldnt have thesemost of these things are not considered sinful by christians to the best of my knowledge  look if you want to play atheist  christian strawman games i have no interest in continuing the conversation  quite frankly its irrelevant it you consider them to be wrong or even if you consider it to be hypocritical  the issue is whether they have the right to that opinion that differs from yours  thats the nature of freedom of religion isnt it  if an employer did consider any of those to be sinful i dare say that a law requiring any of those that they stay open on sundays for example would meet comparable backlashgtim an atheist should i be allowed to stop employees from wearing a crucifix in my place of business under their clothes or silently praying i am the one that provides the place for them to do itno as you would be infringing on their freedom of religion  if a law was passed that said you have to provide prayer mats for muslims wishing to pray to mecca though  or if religious education was a mandated benefit that you had to fund  yeah id have a problem with that tooagain the issue is not the allowance of religion or the allowance of lack of religion for that matter  the issue is conscripted participation by way of funding for something that they consider to be immoralgtobviously your decisions on what immorality stops at your skin and what is legal begins with the law of the land aca is the law you may find some of it immoral for you but you are not forced to do those things  that would be an issue if it required an atheist to provide religious materials just as much as it is herebut they are forced to do these things thats where the objection comes from  they are forced to provide health care coverage that includes contraceptive coverage  that is the law is it notgtthere is the truly absolute option  stop your business shut up shop that is your right then you wont have anything to worry aboutthis is a bit of a mafia mentality in my opinion  hey you have the right to not pay protection money to us its your choiceyou can always close shop  its very coersive you have freedom of religion all wrong and absurdity follows naturallyyour freedom of religion gives you no right to restrict me in any way if you want to run a business and employ people you must not enforce your religion on them you are not free to take away my rightsif you cannot accept that your employees will use their healthcare in a way that is counter to your religious beliefs do not have any employeesvery simply  there are some religions that are against any medical treatment whatsoever would it be right for them to not have a first aid kitfinally if christians are able to pick and chose what they find sinful it sort of pulls the rug out from under everything else doesnt it or did god give everyone a few mulligans when it comes to what is defined as sinif a law was passed that required me to buy prayer matte that would be interference of church with state birth control is a legal and well regarded medical practiced enjoyed by christian and nonchristian alike and is not a symbol of any religionyou seem to find it pretty important that money from the employer goes to the insurance program where does that money come from customers issued by the federal mint earned by the work of the employees using infrastructure paid for by me and my grandparents to think the money a christian employer puts towards insurance for hisher employees is only theirs is rather rudeyou are not forced to wear a rubber or take a pill you are unable to prevent others from doing it i hope that makes it clearas far as coercion goes i think forcing people to live under your personal interpretation of a  to  year old book is the tops gtyour freedom of religion gives you no right to restrict me in any way if you want to run a business and employ people you must not enforce your religion on them you are not free to take away my rightsgtyou are not forced to wear a rubber or take a pill you are unable to prevent others from doing it i hope that makes it clearand again nobody is saying anything about preventing anything restricting anything banning anything  at all  everyone agrees that should you desire to take contraception theres not a think that an employer can do to prevent you from making that decision any more than they could prevent you from drinking a beer at homecontention is coming from saying that they must then pay for it  the issue is that someone else must fund your health care including coverage for things that they find to be morally wrong  employer sponsored health care is is not a right in any reasonable sense of the term its a fringe benefit included as part of your compensation and they should have the right to attach whatever qualifications they choose to provide  so someone else saying if you work for me ill pay for this but not this is not a violation of your rights its a mutually agreed upon consideration in exchange for labor lets say economic externalities and limited liability are against my religion why does mitt romney essentially argue that corporations and businesses should get these things for free  from the american people    including me thus violating my newlydeclared religious beliefs  the insurance being provided is based on on employer compensation to say that it is the right of the employer to choose when you get with your coverage is to say they can also control what you can buy with your money that you get with your paycheckbasing your argument on personal morality is calling for a problem  religious freedoms could be drawn to blood transfusions antibiotics viagra some acne meds that may cause birth defects  basically a line needs to be drawn  our government has rightfully in my opinion come to the conclusion that providing birth control as a free service to be provided by our insurance structure is important when it comes to personal health economic reason and personal choice  we can argue whether you hold these things to be true however to say that our employer can make these decisions for us retroactively is down right wrong based on your own argument religious freedom lastly to make the point that a person can choose where they work is only as strong as your personal ability to find a job at all and sounds ridiculous to those who cant provide for themselves let alone a familyim not one to go on and on about the tyranny of the corporation however in this case it holds ultimately true  to give this power to an employer is a step to morally control their employees  whether these services should be free is besides the fact to whether an employer can control your compensationjust briefly on whether those services should be free i agree on the grounds that the studies are in and birth control works in our society   the places in the us that have the highest teen birth rates are states that teach abstinence  the economics of women around the world today changed with the empowerment of their reproductive rights  that cat is out of the bag birth control works for women it works for families universally with the exception of user and small statistical error  our federal government who has the power to makes laws need to make those laws on the factual information that we have not on personal morality choices that have no personal effect on your neighbor  in this case the person paying is blurred between employee and employer however it is your compensation if it were cash i know you would feel differently the government has chosen rightly that insurers need to provide birth control for free and in the same sense that encouraging any health habits is right  luckily we live in a country where we can all decide to take the advise or not its upholding the employers religion over the religion of all their employees it isnt a freedom of religion issue  and to your argument that romney is trying to uphold freedom of religion that is incorrect as wellfreedom of religion doesnt mean that you get to impose your christian religion on others  thats discriminating against everyone who isnt christian and wants that coverage  also contraception is not a religionnor is it something people are forced to take  it is an important drug used for womens health care  it is none of the employers business if it is used for hormonecancer issues or if it is used to have sexual relationsit is more of a privacy issue that anythingbesides what kind of person in this day and age is against contraception  its  not   the fact that this is an issue shows how out of touch republicans and conservative religious leaders are  what is next  the only valid medical treatment allowed to be covered will be leeches   this isnt imposing religion on others its being able to do what you want with your property no one is forced to work for an employer who does not cover birth control in his insurance package do you really think that it is moral to force an employer to pay for something for his employees if people want an employer who doesnt pay for birth control they will work for one if they want an employer who pays for birth control they will work for onethe governments claim to be able to rule over these things is laughable if it can tell someone what to do with their own property then it is claiming to own that property since it does not own the property of employers it has no rational right to prohibit them from not including birth control in their insurance the right that it has is might makes right and that is an immoral thingif he were trying to disallow employers from giving birth control that would be immoral but hes just trying to let them have a choice i am by no means a romney supporter but these measures are upholding religious freedom and property rights not forcing anyone to do anything yeah its sensationalist i wish people would go against romney for real reasons see hey guys lets go nuke iran thatll be fun instead of this idiotic shit about him actually respecting peoples rights if a rational person saw only this about the man they would conclude that hes a good choice too bad  of rpolitics is an emotionally sensationalist irrational mess freedom of religion includes freedom from religion one persons religious beliefs do not supersede the legal rights of another while i agree freedom religion thing screwed upthis legislation purely antiwomen it men controlling womens bodies how i this why arent they restrictions viagra contraception used reasons than preventing child birth viagra purely sex so clearly they objecting women control their reproductive rightsyour insurance cost going this any small gain covering contraception will up women pregnant pregnancy child expensive than contraception so better costwise well viagra helps you conceive in a way contraception prevents it  theyre not the same in fact in this context they are oppositei agree the whole thing is bullshit but the comparison is fundamentally flawed what about vasectomies vasectomies are a better comparison and in fact vasectomies are not covered in many plans  theyre considered an elective procedure health departments will do them for free or for very little cost getting them reversed on the other hand is a whole different matter vasectomies would be a much more valid comparison yeah i agree it isnt a perfect comparison  conservatives at least some frame it as it allowing permiscous behavior without consequence which is garbage since there are plenty of other consequences or reasons to use it  viagra would be a tool to use to be permiscuous but would still have consequencesvasctomies is a better comparison and will have to use that in the future also there are nonmedical forms of birth control  from the insurance companies point of view why pay for the pill when the individual can buy condoms on their own dime  if the free market worked for health insurance then you could choose a plan that covered it  but this is just another example of why it doesnt you dont get to choose also my contraceptives have never been covered by my insurance  every damn condom ive ever used has been paid for out of my pocketi want my  back  congratulations on having sex twice actually it was at an airport so it was  for one condomi only use half of the condom though because i didnt have to unroll it all the way  well in that case i hope you tied it off to save for later and condoms have never been used to treat a medical condition  you dont get hormonal balance or prevention of cancer from wearing them you do get prevention of cancer from wearing condomsthe fact that youre ignorant about hpv doesnt make you more right i dont think you even need to get far this is all about giving the employer more power over the employee romneys corporate donors love it viagra was originally developed for heart conditions but i generally agree with you also viagra is prescribed for women used by women and paid for by insurance for women do you have a justification for why birth control pills are covered in almost every plan in america but condoms are not covered in hardly any  using your logic ill say this must be purely antiman and is about controlling mens bodies until i need a prescription and a health check to buy condoms you are going to have a hard time with this argument  you do realize that birth control pills are not used solely as contraception yeah gt while i agree this isnt a freedom of religion thingits not about freedom of religion  nobody is forbidden from worshiping whatever they want  its about employment lawgt this legislation is purely antiwomenthat is what this is about you quote me saying it isnt a freedom of religion thingand then tell me its not about freedom of religion  thanks  sorry i misread your post no problem it happenswas just a bit amusing  gt why arent they having the same restrictions on viagrabecause viagra isnt contraceptiongtcontraception is used for many reasons other than preventing child birthnone of which are inherently fatalgtviagra is purely for having sex yes and cochlear implants are purely for hearing that doesnt make it a proper comparison to bcgtso clearly they are just objecting to women having control over their reproductive rightsdont conflate civil and human rights nor positive and negative rights also viagra isnt for stopping reproduction so again not a proper comparisonin fact men have far fewer reproductive rights and someone not paying for your bcan attack on your rights otherwise i can start listing all the things men dont have coverage for that the female counterpart is covered and then maybe you would realize your argument is rather short sightedthis is one of the prime narratives and it is nothing but a huge misdirection and misunderstanding of what rights actually are contraception prevents pregnancy which can be fatal as well as cause a whole host of other health problems anything can be fatalthe maternal mortality rate in the us is so low that its hardly something to be considered fatal over  women die everyday worldwide the mortality rate has risen in the united states to  of every  live birthsim sure to those women it is very very fataledit besides it doesnt have to be fatal how many families have gone bankrupt from complications arising from a birth gone wrong that could have all been prevented with an  round of birth control gtover  women die everyday worldwidemore like the mortality rate has risen in the united states to  of every  live births every  births as in gtim sure to those women it is very very fatalyes and rabies is very very fatal to the  people that die from rabies every year please dont confuse individuals with the aggregateresources are limited and going but some die sometimes isnt helpful in properly allocating limited resources secondly removing competition removes the incentive to maximize efficient use of those resources you have to actually make an ethical or economic argument  preventing death isnt an ethical argument  million women suffer a complication that has an adverse effect on their health do you think they are cheap its actually more economically sound to cover birth control rather than have to pay for the myriad of other health problems childbirth can cause which do you think a healthcare company would rather pay for a little birth control or the nearly one million dollars my aunt racked up after her third child was born between the two of them gtpreventing death isnt an ethical argumentno preventing a certain kind of death isnt one unless youre prepared to determine how we remove all dangers around the world you cant apply a universal standard with limited resourcesgt million women suffer a complication that has an adverse effect on their healthquality of life yes quality of life is not the same as life threatening you also have not presented an argument as to why the quality of life increase from bc is justified whereas increases from other drugs are notgt do you think they are cheapit would be cheaper if the market was less regulated and had proper competitiongtits actually more economically sound to cover birth control rather than have to pay for the myriad of other health problems childbirth can causeno its cheaper for the individual in the aggregate its less clear since sometimes the number of pregnancies goes up as women are more sexually active while on the pill its similar to circumcision in africa theyre told circumcision reduces the chances of acquiring an sti so they have even more sex so sti infection rates go up instead of down also even if an insurance company wanted to cover something more expensive instead thats their prerogative additionally there are several alternatives that are more effective such as iuds or cheaper such as condoms gtwhich do you think a healthcare company would rather pay forthe obvious answer is neithergta little birth control or the nearly one million dollars my aunt racked up after her third child was born between the two of themagain the market is not conducive to competition forcing it further that direction just has costs increase more contrary to popular belief the church doesnt hate sex   only cause no one asks the alter boys how they feel  so id say closer to  of the church hates it haha it is so funny to be a bigot when you are in the majority group  you should be ashamed of yourself i never was able to understand how christians who make up a mjority of the country and of the people represented in government can have such a minorityvictim mentality  you are in the majority inflicting your religion on others who do not want to live by the distorted version of the bible you make laws from on reddit you are a majority an atheist reaping karma by implying that priests are all pedophiles  do you really feel that your bigotry is alright because some of your victims are as bad as you when roles are reversed  you also presume to know me a noncatholic who thinks the catholic ban on birth control is a ridiculous misinterpretation of scripture  that doesnt mean i feel that they should be coerced into following my beliefs  i believe in freedom of choice  you are just another oppressor forcing your views onto others take some time away from being butt hurt instantly to realize that we are two seperate posters you are groupingdont ask people to not judge you while in the same post judge them  learn the difference between a person voicing an opinion on the internet and an oppressor and most importantly lighten up francis i never said it does  it hates people having sex outside of marriage  it wants married people in the religion to have as many babies as possible to grow the religion  its also very patriarchal and does not women to be able to control reproduction i may be wrong but i would imagine that the insurance would cover the medication if it was for other purposes for than contraception  yes viagra is purely for having sex but it is treating an actual disease  im all for contraception but the ability to have a baby is not a disease  i mean is it possible for me to get a prescription for condoms cause that would be awesome  gtim all for contraception but the ability to have a baby is not a diseasewomens birth control in the form of a chemical and not a physical device such as a diaphragm can be used to address other issues than pregnancy prevention and as i mentioned in my first line if it was for something other than contraceptive purposes i would hope it would be covered however if it was only to be used for the purpose of preventing pregnancy you dont really have much of an argument for why it should be covered other then it being great for the economysources then why make it part of a prescription plan if it is an economic stimulus plan then hand out vouchers or something that doesnt have to go through the insurance companies  rx companies do things like this all the time theres no reason why the govt couldnt set it up as a separate program and it wouldnt be any worse than people handing out condoms to try and label the ability to have kids as a disease is the problem i have here how about because its a fucking prescription drug why should they spend millions of dollars setting up a second program when all they have to do is pass a bill that sayshey insurance companies birth control coverage is mandatory on the plans you offer no one said children were a disease im just saying unwanted children are a huge drain on everyoneinsurance companies want to cover bc because it saves them a shit ton of money in the long run no ones trying to make you take birth control theyre just saying  hey if you want it you can get if for little or no cost through the insurance you already havei dont understand why no one cares that they cover boner pills but i should just go fuck myself if i dont want to be a parentlets be fucking honest were never going to get people to stop fucking ever it wont happenso lets as a society make this activity as safe and economically neutral as we can  i feel like the money is going to be spent on the medication either way so i think youre exaggerating the millions that will be spent you could even put the voucher online so that you dont have to print it i realize that we arent going to stop people from having intercourse and guess what i dont want to  im a college student and all for people getting action i just dont see why we expect guys to pay for condoms and girls should get birth control free thats more discrimination than any of what romney is supportingold people are a drain on society as well though does that mean that the medication for assisted suicide should be covered as well cause those medications can save a shit ton of money gtand as i mentioned in my first lineglossed over that my bad so you think that each woman should have to sit down with her employer and explain whether or not shes using birth control to prevent pregnancy or for health reason  how do you not see this as discrimination yes it is it would be discriminating against the people who have nothing wrong with them but still want free prescription drugs  insurance companies require prior authorizations from doctors all the time which is basically them wanting to know why that certain medication is prescribed for the patient doing so requires no communication between the woman and her employer insurance company yes  employer   hormonal birth control isnt just used to prevent pregnancy women are prescribed it to alleviate cramps ovarian diseases and other afflictions that arent familyplanning related yep and in those cases its generally covered by all insurance plans  now what was your point most people who are against covering contraception dont recognize these uses so if a woman needs birth control for nonpregnancy reasons she needs to sit down with her employer and explain that   viagra is prescribed for way more than treating a disease  dont kid yourselfcondoms literally are only for having sex and offer no medical benefits  but to be honest i wish insurance did cover this too  think about the prevention of stds and unwanted pregnanciesit would save us all a ton of money enough with sensationalist titles people you disagree with bill think its horrible idea hes against freedom religion that obfuscates true issue hand here  and completely wrong whats wrong my comment or the title the against freedom of religion line in the title this particular effort isnt against freedom of religion  in fact i almost guarantee that it will be spun as allow employers and insurers to exercise their own freedom of religionyou can definitely make a case that the republican party doesnt like freedom of religion sad but rather apparent but this particular bill is not really against it its probusinessrights rather than antifreedom not to mention its also quite the opposite the title seems explicit and accurate to me i assume its that first part you have a problem with right the true issue is that he claims to be for freedom of religion when in fact hes all for subjugating me to religious choices of my employer ive been busted by the police for working on a sunday blue law this takes it a step further into my body i think its fair romney would use excuse though deny women insurance coverage birth control denying coveragemaking illegalin fact fully subsidizing something is what makes costs go up in the first place what is that guys fucking problem if everything you know about romney is learned through rpoliticsyoure going to have a bad time the liberal bias here is actually ridiculous and completely paints things that he says in utterly ridiculous ways this title is a perfect example the issue here isnt even about freedom of religion in fact id argue that this actually supports freedom of religion its about whether or not you want employers to have control over what they pay for in terms of coverage the obama side to it is that some rights should be necessities to employees whereas romney actually advocates more freedom of healthcoverage from the employers point of view when phrased like that it makes a bit more sense doesnt it wtf reddit it is freedom religion companies free exercise their religious beliefs has anybody here read the first amendment if i know youre heathen lesser individual satan spawn you aint gettin bacon your blt my restaurant only christians enjoy bacon and dessert menu its very simple   business only exist because the government is gracious enough to allow it  individual ideas are considered an enemy of the state and therefor an enemy to society as a wholeunless all wealth is evenly divided then america is an evil place that needs to be purged of those thingsthis is the new normal you just havnt been assimilated yet kids will be though gtbusiness only exist because the government is gracious enough to allow iteg   limited liabilitywhat  did op  think that was a right  granted by gods no silly man  rights come from the government  you definatley need reeducated now consider that the big bad gubment you complain about also gives corporations limited liability    for free    at our the citizens expense   sorry in case it wasnt apparent all my statements were sarcasm actually its not so apparent   the first comment seemed like sarcasm but the second one not so much   thats one of my complaints you have a problem with limited liability i have the same problem with limited liability as i do mandatory minimums  judicial branch decision i dont get it either  i dont agree with the actions suggested but it is freedom of religion being taken too far in my opinion and it is definitely not anyone denying freedom of religion the question is does a corporations religious belief trump that of the worker who paid for that health benefit with her laborif youre a christian check out luke  to hear what jesus had to say about that   theyre paying for the health benefit theyre getting theyre not paying for the benefits theyre not gettingalso you dont have to work for or buy from such companies if you think theyre wrong to do so how do you as a human benefit from the corporatism you advocate lower costs and higher quality for goods and services including things such as education medicine housing food and water if not covering such benefits is disincentivized by the market companies will change their tune lest they be outcompeted by those that do this isnt a case of a company not getting to practice its own belief its about those who are in charge of that company forcing their employees to practice specific beliefs except its notemployees are still free to purchase bc on their own the company just refuses to subsidize it theyre also free to find a new employer  says someone who has clearly never had to support themselves financially  i do now and have for many years  no it absolutely isnt it just means they dont want the government to force them to pay for something they dont agree with   forcing where are you getting this from this is entirely for freedom of religion since employers can provide what they want according to their beliefs people are still free to do whatever they want i dont see how lack of forced birth control subsidy  forcing ones religion on others in fact i see this more of the other way forcing employers to pay for contraception is effectively forcing them to subscribe to a highly liberalsocialist agenda granted employers can still choose to do this under romneys plan its just that with obama they have no choice its forcing the company to adopt and pay for secularism forcing companies could very well violate the free exercise clause ironically nobody is forcing them to practice anything they just have to purchase their own contraception as opposed to having it subsidized  really shittyrep so according to you then chic fil a for example should be able to fire any known gays best of luck with that whats next the lunch counters can be anti black again because its the companys counter and religious policy based on obscure scripture   religious discrimination  freedom laws prohibiting activities such as in not covering due to religious beliefs  freedomthe first admentment states you are free from religious discrimination  by any law the government might inact but it doesnt state that the citizens cant act towards their beliefs is it right that they do it no its not but is is freedom if we say they cant no its not companies  personcorporate policy based on the beliefs of its executives impacts its customers when those beliefs conflict  that is discrimination and so whatif you discriminate in your company then people will just punish you by not using your goods and servicesshits not rocket science dude this isnt the subreddit for logic and reason please take your truth elsewhere everyone who workd jehovahs witness would utterly fuked not really  the employer is probably going to figure out fast that if they dont offer a competitive compensation package theyre not going to get any good employees  if they instead decide to offer a shitty health plan theyre probably going to go out of business  thats the way the free market works   not with unemployment as high as it is and an entire generations worth of student loans to pay off employees are currently too disposable and easily replaced to force employers to modify their behavior because people cant change jobs or get a different insurance s yes for we live in a magical land where ripe jobs fall plentifully from the branches of the magical jobtrees infinitely available to all you do realize tying the hands of employers is what stifles expansion right at what point did this discussion go in that direction this religious freedom issue or rather  freedom person free requirements fund provide for engage activities services morally disagrees with if person wants benefits they free employer provider who freely chooses provide them employing people isnt a sacred right  it comes with obligations of nondiscrimination minimum wage overtime workplace safety etc  now it requires certain employers to offer health insurance that includes basic preventative health care services exactly the notion that employers can impose this sort of religious belief on their employees but not others is a pretty absurd argument from republicans and the religious right the question of where you draw the line is simple employers cannot impose their religious beliefs on their employees   are people running a soup kitchen imposing their beliefs on the homelessis a church having a bake sale imposing their beliefs on their customerstheyre not imposing their beliefs theyre exercising them you can exercise yours by not working for them or buying from them im afraid i dont see the relevance of your examples there is no contractual relationship between people going to a soup kitchen or a bake sale and the person providing the service an employment contract is governed by laws an employers unwillingness to provide certain health insurance coverages because of the employers personal religious beliefs would seem discriminatory  and im just throwing this one out there but a soup kitchen receiving government funds isnt allowed to proselytize gtan employment contract is governed by laws an employers unwillingness to provide certain health insurance coverages because of the employers personal religious beliefs would seem discriminatory freedom of association is a thingthe contract is mutually agreed upon no one forced you to sign it if you dont like it organize and have people not work for them and boycott them the market is very good at meeting consumer demand either they will change or one of their competitors that does offer such services will put them out of business that or at least those who do require such benefits as part of the stipulation will only work for such employersgtand im just throwing this one out there but a soup kitchen receiving government funds isnt allowed to proselytizeas they shouldnt it may be mutually agreed upon but the content of that offer letter can vary a lot as can the details in the employment agreement things like health insurance are likely to change over the course of ones employment and pay will likely change too the capacity for change isnt inherently bad but dont you see that there is a slippery slope here its effectively taking rights away from employers to fund what they want to fund with their own money where can you draw the line do you think that if they arbitrarily added a requirement to give a bonus to couples when they have a child that that would be okay there needs to be a balance of rights on both sides thats what the issue should be about rather than religion  gt but dont you see that there is a slippery slope herethere isnt onegt its effectively taking rights away from employersemploying people is not some sort of inviolable right  its a privilege that comes with certain obligations which are defined by lawgt to fund what they want to fund with their own moneyjust like nondiscrimination laws minimum wage overtime and workplace safety lawsgt there needs to be a balance of rights on both sidesin the contemporary us the power lies squarely with employers  any balance will involve them losing considerable ground discrimination actually violates personal rights though how does not paying for contraception violate your own rights you can still buy contraception if you want it its not illegal its just not being covered along with the myriad other things that are i also like how you dismiss the slippery slope comment without addressing the point i made about how one could develop how broadly are you going to define healthcare if it apparently even includes things people do by choice which are fairly inexpensive what about vasectomies what about plastic surgery says who employing people is a contract if an employer and an employee agree on a contract they follow its terms the contract could be anything and it is moral so long as both parties agree to it attempting to force people not to enter peaceful contracts is violating their rights gtgt  it comes with obligations of nondiscrimination minimum wage overtime workplace safety etc now it requires certain employers to offer health insurance that includes basic preventative health care services where do these obligations come from are you or government arbitrarily or emotionally deciding them if not what rational truths are these obligations based on does this randite bullshit ever get you anywhere  or is just a warning signal that youre a fanatic and that you cant communicate with nonfanatics ayn rand is pretty idiotic in a lot of things she calls reasondoes this emotional bullshit ever get you anywhere or is it just a warning signal that youre an idiot and that you cant communicate with people thinking rationallyalso youre dodging the question are these obligations based on emotion or whimsy or are they based on rational thought so apparently not  have a nice day you have it backwards being employed isnt a sacred right are you saying that employing people is a fundamental sacred right  if not then why are you replying to me no conceptually nothing is stopping someone from owning a businessof course the government interfering with running a business is what prevents new competitors from competing with all those big businesses people keep complaining aboutnonetheless employment is not a right is my main point at no point have you replied to anything in my posts nor to direct questionsi dont need any more of your slogans um it was you who started out with your slogan which is a rather flawed one its a misdirection or conflation of civil and human rights for one for two running a business isnt a positive right because of government fiatif i went to national waters and set up a business there i could employ whomever i wished without penalty tying the hands of employers actually makes it harder to hire productive employees only an idiotic employer wouldnt want productive employees so that is why government interference make things worse and your employees are not a right is a rather irrelevant statementhowever being employed as not a right is relevant in that since you have no guarantee to employment employees and employers both have bargaining power in achieving what they want and since employees compete with one another for jobs and employers compete with one another for workers its both fair and voluntary and creates greater improvements for both in the long run unless you interfere with this process then suddenly there is bargaining power for one or the other and then one or both is hurt ok so if a jehovahs witness doesnt believe in blood transfusions their employees shouldnt be able to get them either yup if you get stabbed in the heart your first order of business is to send out your resume theyd have no say in the private dealings of the employee it just wouldnt be funded by them no person is required to fund employee activities  they can choose to not run a company the government is not required to allow you to operate a company however you see fit  there are numerous restrictions on how a company can act if you dont like it dont start one or dont employ people bingocorporations and businesses dont operate in a vacuum   on top of social and economic infrastructure paid for by the american people  they get things limited liability     the former is the rationale behind all manner of public accommodation  including supreme court rulings upholding things like antidiscrimination laws   in exchange for these fertile conditions they have to abide by a few of societys rules   dont want to play game by rules just dont play it so simple yeah women just go get a different job its that easy sweet when am i getting my check for all those bullets used to kill brown people your post titles constantly biased intentionally misleading content articles you post this would better without you planet earth would be better off without  of you and id be happy to take my chances to end up in the elite survivor class  lets get it on that sounds promoting freedom religion he allowing employoers practice their religion their own private companies the employees work restrictions ok so lets just let all sorts of discrimination go on then why stop there my beliefs says that blacks and women dont deserve any health coverage should that be legal to should you be able to be the fucking dictator of your company that has to adhere to no rules that protect the public because you know without society your business wouldnt exist so you have to play by the rules of society  im the fucking dictator of my company  it is a private business employees can quit if they dont like it  i think you should be able to discriminate against anyone you want  it used to be a free country hahah so why do we have child labor laws i one hundred percent disagree with you assertion we are better than allowing bigots to be bigots i want to live in a world that punishes via social pressure mainly ignorance and doesnt let it grow stronger what good is allowing people to discriminate against eachother what is the end goal for that approach why do you think thats beneficial to humanity you are not the dictator of your private company there are plently of laws and rules you have got to follow do you really want to live in a world when you can be fired for using birth control or for being born black do you really want to live in a world where the corporation that makes your products is a driving force for ignorance and discrimination in the country  okay social pressure is good probably the first actual good idea youve saidif you run you business in a way that harms your employees or your customers then you will be left without employees or customers in time you will no longer be an employerwhy is that due to social pressure if people catch on that i dont serve black people at my pizzaria a vast majority of people will stop eating there furthermore id probably be protested so not only do i lose customers id lose employees who strongly disagree with my desicion and id also have protest outside of my private propertyis it good that i do that no its not but i wouldnt be open for long after doing thatthe same thing can be applied to all businesses dont pay the ones that dont deserve to be in business it said denying access to birth control  you obviously dont understand logic because nobody said that a person can be denied protection based on race  this is a slippery slope argument and its quite evident  why stop there is just one textbook example of a slippery slope argumentdo you understand what that is or do you need a little help  if somebody is proposing an idea they are proposing that idea  not some blown up version of their idea that you consider to be the worst case possiblei really cant stand when people like you come on rpolitics thinking that you are capable of making a legitimate argument  the first paragraph of your article may have been a slippery slope argument but at least it was somewhat coherent  the second paragraph was just a jumble of words you threw together  hilarious would laugh again a slippery slope doesnt imply that its an irrational fear just that you should be cautious about your conclusions i am making the point that anyone and everyone can make up their own religious beliefs and they can even without a doubt find support for those beliefs if they want in the bible my point is that how do you determine a real belief from one that is just made up or asserted because someone just has an opinion on something they are using the respect my religion and bow to it as their justification i am simply saying well at what point can you disregard what someone claims as a religious believe because it has no argument outside of religion or faith this means you will have to bend to every damned religious belief claim there is you cant pick only the religions you like all of them even made up on the spot ones have to fall under this same respect my religion if you are going to start exempting them from something the rest of society has already deemed acceptable
