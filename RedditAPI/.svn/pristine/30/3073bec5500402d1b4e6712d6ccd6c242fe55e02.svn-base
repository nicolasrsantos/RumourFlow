Good grief, you've hit on the solution!

During Obama's next national address, he should pause in the middle to take a big bite of a ham sandwich while proclaiming how much he enjoys a nice thin slice of prosciutto with his eggs every morning.

Then he should pray to Jesus for more pork to eat.  Facing North, just to be safe.
Here's a tidbit:  The word "Muslim" actually means 'one who submits to God'.  So to be perfectly honest, any Christian (or anyone else) who abides by the rules and laws of their faith as dictated by God is also technically a Muslim.
I agree, everyone treats the claim as a smear and an insult instead of just leaving it as 'untrue.'  It makes sense to be angry at the attempt to pander to the Muslim-fearing population and try to lose him votes, but the actual claim that he is a Muslim is neither an insult, a slander, or an 'accusation.'  It's just false.
Make my day and say "But 90% of that 23% don't care and say that shouldn't matter anyways."
I heard he only kicks Christian puppies, that Muslim bastard.
Lolz.

&gt; Fortunately, the American people are, I think, smarter than folks give them credit for.

HaHA!  Mistake number **one**, *Mister* Obama.
