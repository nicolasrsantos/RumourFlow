Alex Jones, with his fear mongering and bombast does the entire \u0027conspiracy community\u0027 a disservice by acting so crazy on national television.\n\nNo joke.  One thing I hated about listening to Jones is when I would check into the topics he would mention, it would always turn out to be a sensationalized truth.  I\u0027d think to myself \"Come on man.  There\u0027s plenty to get pissed off about already.  No need to stretch the truth on anything.\"\n\nJames doesn\u0027t do this.  One of my favorite episodes was [\"More Patriot Mythology\"](http://www.corbettreport.com/episode-207-more-patriot-mythology/).  In it, he debunks a lot of things that get circulated in the community that are not entirely true.\n\nOne I still bring up to this day is the Larry Silverstein \"pull it\" quote that we keep bringing up.  Yes, it\u0027s a demolition term, but as James points out in this episode, to \"pull it\" is to literally pull a building down with cables and heavy machinery.  This is a distinct process from using explosives which is what WTC7 appears to be.\n\nThat, and I hate the form of \"proof\" that relies on tongue slips.  For example, I do believe (believe being purposefully used since I don\u0027t have any hard evidence) crisis actors are used, it\u0027s ridiculous to point to a cop talking to reports using the term \"actors\" to literally mean a stage performer.  I mean, really man??  They clearly mean \"those who took action\".","duration":"","id":3,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_clna7wn","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":2,"links":[1],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"user_name13","label":"I agree, my favorite thing about listening to his podcast is his even keeled nature.
