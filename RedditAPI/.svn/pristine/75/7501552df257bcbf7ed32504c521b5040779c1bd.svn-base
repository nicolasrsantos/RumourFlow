Whether that\u0027s correct or not they may have perceived it to be a relatively short lived campaign. They needed a sustained conflict to justify a massive increase to the military budget, not just for spending but to transform the military and \"upgrade\" it for the 21st century - which would have been a very slow process. According to \"Rebuilding Americas Defences\" written by the Project for a New American Century... published 1 year before 9/11 and endorsed by many members of the Bush administration. Pg.51 is particularly interesting.\n\n**B)** The only real threat to the United States government is the American people. These conflicts allowed for a massive upgrade to the military but not just in terms of raw firepower but also in tactics and strategy. It was a fantastic test bed for countering an insurgency in urban environments using advanced technology from biometrics, drones to propaganda and policy. Essentially a petri dish on how to deal with a possible American revolution in the future (again this is just my opinion)\n\n**C)** It is part of a grander campaign to secure regions near the Caspian Oil basin in an attempt to cement American hegemony in Eurasia and preeminence as described by Zbigniew Brzezinski in \"The Grand Chessboard\" - who should know, being a prominent figure in American foreign policy that he was/is. \n\n**D)** Drugs. Before the invasion of Afghanistan 30% of European hereon was sourced in Afghanistan. After the invasion this rose to 90%+. Intelligence communities are rumoured to use drug trafficking revenue as a source for liquid cash flow for centuries - enough to buy government\u0027s, dismantle nations and raise armies etc.\n\n","duration":"","id":222,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cusxzxn","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":221,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"werewolf1224","label":"So what was the motive behind the invasion of Iraq?
