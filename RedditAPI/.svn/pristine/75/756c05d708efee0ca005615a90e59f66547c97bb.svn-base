That, too, is what groups like ISIL want.  ISIL does not speak for Islam.  They are thugs and killers, part of a cult of death, and they account for a tiny fraction of more than a billion Muslims around the world -- including millions of patriotic Muslim Americans who reject their hateful ideology. Moreover, the vast majority of terrorist victims around the world are Muslim.  If we’re to succeed in defeating terrorism we must enlist Muslim communities as some of our strongest allies, rather than push them away through suspicion and hate.\n\n...It is the responsibility of all Americans -- of every faith -- to reject discrimination.  It is our responsibility to reject religious tests on who we admit into this country.  It’s our responsibility to reject proposals that Muslim Americans should somehow be treated differently.  Because when we travel down that road, we lose.  That kind of divisiveness, that betrayal of our values plays into the hands of groups like ISIL.  Muslim Americans are our friends and our neighbors, our co-workers, our sports heroes -- and, yes, they are our men and women in uniform who are willing to die in defense of our country.  We have to remember that.\"\n\n[Full text of Obama\u0027s comments.](http://news.yahoo.com/full-text-obama-speech-national-security-threat-terrorism-030203313.html)","duration":"","id":5,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cxr5i6h","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Obama on Islamophobia, ISIS, and Muslims","label":"big-dreams","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_3vsl6a","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.449527675E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.449576215E9,"simScore":0.7156801102852279,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":6,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"spilk","label":"/r/shittytumblrgifs\n","duration":"","id":6,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cxrgab8","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Obama on Islamophobia, ISIS, and Muslims","label":"big-dreams","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_3vsl6a","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.449527675E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.449607712E9,"simScore":1.0,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},{"index":7,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"con77","label":"Obama has betrayed his oath of office.
