You mean like a reading test? But maybe we could exempt people whose grandfathers could vote...

Oh, wait. Right.
People likely to be uneducated are also likely to be lower-class, and to have different interests than the upper and middle classes. To disinclude them would be to inaccurately represent the will of the country.
Uneducated != stupid and gullible.
So certain stupid people can have more power than other? I am not reassured.

Improve public civics education. Elevate public discourse. Get people **informed**.
...about what gets them more cream and sugar.
An "I love niggers" shirt would somehow be amusing.

Thanks for my daily awkward laugh.
Those are the people that will decide who our president is.

Fuck.
Lemme guess. You think only people who had enough money to pay for private school should vote.

You should not vote. Just don't. Also, castrate yourself.
...so you're voting for Obama.

With all due respect, after 4 years of Bush, Obama will feel like a breath of fresh air. Sure, he still supports US involvement in the Middle East, but I honestly think that the public (yes, the public) won't support a candidate that doesn't.
Either way, he believes in secular government (see http://www.wayofthemind.org/2008/02/21/obama-on-religion/ ).
Islam is no worse than Christianity.
Contemporary, *maybe*, but from an historical perspective Christianity and Judaism simply had more time to mature.
Nonsense. Islam had a history of supporting the sciences and the arts when Christianity was still torturing people for saying the earth went around the sun.
Also, tell them it's spelled with only 1 R.
