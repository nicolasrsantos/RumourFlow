Sources probably wouldn\u0027t give this story to the NYT; the fear of retribution from Palin if discovered would mitigate any pleasure derived from contributing to the public interest.  However, a niche publication like the National Enquirer may get a story out by offering a payoff.  The story may be false, in which case it will quickly die.  But if it is true--if it is supported by, say, testimony in the illicit lover\u0027s divorce proceedings--it will be picked up and carried by the mainstream and get out into the public sphere.  While I do think the press should keep its nose out of the private lives of politicians to a great extent, if that politician is running on a platform extolling their moral virtue, it is all fair game.
