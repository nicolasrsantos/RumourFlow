So, it's exactly like Christianity then, only with brown people.
That's not what Fox says, so you must be lying, because Fox news loves America, and somebody that loves America would never tell anything but the truth!
Except that we installed those Theocracies, including the one in Iran which we're now apparently super-duper-threatened by, what with their ZERO nukes and ZERO ICBMs and all.

So who's the real villain here? The WBC-Islam fundies that we put into power? Or us, for putting them into power and regressing the entire region 150 years?
I believe they're actually very similar, the difference is actually how secular the nation is. Very few nations still exist that are legally/constitutionally Christian, and those that do are actually not very different from the middle east at all. Take a look at South America, it's being torn apart by violence from cartels and rebellions. The only thing keeping it together is secular values like humanism.

America, which I assume you're talking about as a Christian nation, is actually not a christian nation. We may have a lot of Christians, but thanks to the work of our founding fathers and a very small but active atheist/agnostic/secularist population, we don't have to deal with Christian laws being shoved down our throats all the time. Until recently, anyways, and the legislation being offered up by the conservatives right now can be easily compared to the legislation the Taliban and Iranian and Saudi Arabian regimes enacted that created the hyper-theocratic autocracies they have now.
"Islam is markedly more brutal and markedly more militaristic and political than Christianity is, when it comes to central doctrinal writings and how they are usually interpreted."

False. Islamic writings and teachings, up until the late 70s when American influence in the Middle East allowed the Muslim equivalent of the Westboro Baptist Church to gain power, are just as peaceful IF NOT MORE PEACEFUL than Christian writings.

"I don't know any Christian nation or even any currently practicing Christian sect that stones adulterers or amputates limbs for theft. While Christians have crusaded in the past, there is no doctrinal support for crusading in the Bible."

Actually there is. Numerous points in the bible call for the death of non-believers and the stoning of children/women/gays/sinners. It also does directly call for the armies of christ to go forth and war in his name.

Both doctrines are equally harmful because both of them require a person to suspend disbelief and cease questioning things so that they can accept a pre-determined "truth" which of course will be delivered to them orally by a person who's spent their lives studying this "truth" under the tutelage of someone else who spent their lives studying this "truth" under the tutelage of someone else who spent their lives studying this "truth" and so on. This means they'll accept anything they hear from someone who claims to be an authority on the matter. Which of course is how abuse always starts.
