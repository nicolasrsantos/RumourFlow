I don't think he acts effeminate.   I think its that he has shown a complete lack of lust for women.  Like when you watch Bill Clinton or a either Bush you see them get a little excited around some women.  Lindsey does not.  Does not make him gay though.  

Edit: Lindsey acts like a eunuch.  Hope that clears things up.  
&gt; Men don't have to drooling everytime they encounter a woman.

Did I say that?  You totally missed what I am saying.  People reacted differently to the sex they are attracted to.  This is just normal stuff.  Not something obscene or rude.  


&gt; He could just be a little awkward

No, that would show even more. 


&gt; He could just not be a sex-crazed animal 

This I agree with.  He could be asexual.  

 &gt;he could be a respectful person who treats men and women in the same professional manner

Even if he exhibited the behavior it would not be unprofessional or disrespectful.  It is the difference between a fake smile and a real smile.   Some people just think all smiles are real.  I am kind of envious of that.  
lol, no.  They are not lusting of women.  It is totally different than conducting themselves without lust.  A person with lust in their heart, Like Bill Clinton, conducts an interview differently with a women than a man.  Lindsey just lacks that. I should not have written anything since reddit loves twisting shit like this. 
It is something you would never notice about yourself. It has nothing to do with being gay or straight. It is just how people interact.  I know trying to explain how people act on reddit can be hard since this place causes autism.  This action is unavoidable.  Part of learning how to deal with people is to harness it, not suppress it.  Lindsey just lacks that.  Could also be from his military or trial days.  
Vote for Trump! 
Nope
Lizard people do not get off that way.  
&gt;There’s just a dislike for President Obama that is visceral. It’s almost irrational


We hear that from so many others running.   
There is no bases in reality that Obama was born in Kenya or is a Muslim.  It should not matter at all since he had a American mother.  It is not an issue.  

Bush's on the other hand is within the real of possibility.  I certainly believe Bush had an unspecific threat from Bin Laden.  That is a reason to have legitimate criticism.
