Except that countries that have a muslim majority pretty much rig everything so that the country is ruled by a Theocracy, and while there are some people out there that would claim that the US is a Theocracy, I doubt they have visited many muslim-lead countries. 
Please consider that my statement doesn't contradict yours. I was merely saying that Muslim countries are not like Christian countries, when you look at where they stand on the social, political, and economic spectrum. 
In my original post I defined Christian and Muslim nations as countries with a majority of Christians, or a majority of Muslims. Countries with a majority of Christians are generally open to people of all faiths. While countries which are a majority Muslim are Theocracies. 

That being said, there are some countries with established Christian State Religions, such as Norway, Greece and even England. I don't believe South Africa is one of them. Still, I wouldn't consider these Theocracies- even though Wikipedia does.  
I'm sure there are many I don't know any about, and a few I know some about. Wouldn't claim to be an authority but I have looked a little into the issue. 
Exactly. Obama might actually be influenced by Muslim doctrine. By some definitions, that *does* make him a Muslim. Who gives a fuck? He seems like a decent guy. I like decent people, regardless of what they call themselves.
