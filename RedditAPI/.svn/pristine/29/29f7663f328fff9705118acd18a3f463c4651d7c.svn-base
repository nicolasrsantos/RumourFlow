Bush was fighting a holy war. Obama is a just a practical commander, and i\u0027m sure Romney would be too.\n\nCruise missles and drones don\u0027t arrest people. They don\u0027t torture them. They don\u0027t video-tape what they do. \n\nObama is a nerd, and Romney will be too, when it comes to these issues. Neither one will quickly send un-educated foot-soldiers with guns to any country. They\u0027ll stick with the highly-trained subset of the forces (the special forces, etc.), drones and missles. \n\nSending the working class armed with guns and cultural intolerance to another nation is just a PR disaster from every angle: families upset, allies upset, local people will dislike americans, etc. \n\nIn terms of software development: Bush made the mistake of believing in the mythical man-month. The idea that adding more people to the conflict, always makes the situation better. In reality, sometimes it just makes things way worse, and you rather want less people, that are more qualified, to do it all themselves. \n\nAnd as an out-sider (i\u0027m from Holland), i suspect Romney will keep Obama\u0027s foreign policies in tact. He would be an idiot not to, and he\u0027s no idiot, and he\u0027s not hold back by his opinions, if he even has those.

Romney hasn\u0027t even cracked $750K.\n\nJP Morgan gave 800K to Obama in \u002708\nJP Morgan gave $520K to Romney now\n\nCitigroup gave Obama $735K in \u002708\nCitigroup gave Romney $336K now\n\nUBS gave Obama $532K in \u002708\nUBS gave Romney $$250K now\n\nYour assertion that Obama isn\u0027t in bed with bankers and finance is just false.

I do know that we pulled combat troops out.\n\nIs that \"good enough\" for me? Really. I was pointing out that Obama did not do what he said he would do. He has a long history of that. However I do understand that both he and Bush agreed on the withdrawal time frame. My only point is that Obama agreed to the schedule that Bush set, both on Iraq and Afghanistan. It proves he\u0027s not much different. We can talk about training their military and police all day long, but at the end of the day, we were there for a decade, or near it. We just needed to get out, and Obama realized that voters wanted to get out, which is why he made bashing the previous administration on global conflicts a large part of his campaign.\n\nIf Obama really wanted to be good enough for me, he would have pulled out of Afghanistan by now, Iraq earlier, and not gone into Libya. Fun fact, did you know that back when we were friends with Gaddafi, we mistakenly killed one of his sons by bombing the wrong village in Libya? lol.\n\nThe truth of the matter is, watch this video. We had planned to go into Libya all along, just like all the rest of those countries. Obama just went along with the plan.

It is illegal for a company to donate to a candidate\u0027s campaign.  \n\nIf you want to donate more than $200 (up to a $2500 limit per election) to a candidate as an individual, you have to fill out a form declaring who you are, including where you work.  This information is public so opensecret tabulate all the people that donate to a candidate who also happen to have the same employer and pretty soon it\u0027s OMG, Goldman Sachs gave 1 million dollar to Obama or why is the government giving money to Ron Paul.   What this mean is at least 400 employee of GS gave $2500 to Obama.  I can\u0027t find the exact figures but GS has around 20,000 employees in the US, where even the receptionist make about $100,000.  So I don\u0027t think it\u0027s hard to to believe that there are at least 400 Democrats/Republican amongst them who\u0027s willing to contribute the maximum to Obama/Romney of their own free will. \n\nAlso it is illegal for the companies to ask their employee to give money to candidate or reimburse them for doing so.","duration":"","id":863,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_c60pj1d","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":860,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"ricehq","label":"OK...why are Ron Paul\u0027s Top Contributors the Dept. of Defense, The US Army and the US Navy.
