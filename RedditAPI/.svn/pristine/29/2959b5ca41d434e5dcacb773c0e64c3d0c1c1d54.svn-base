Y'know, I really think that there's between 20 and 33% of the population that'll just say anything to pollsters. Seriously:

1. 30% of voters *still* approve of Bush's job as President.
2. 20% or so think that the rapture will happen *this year*.
4. 33% don't know the Earth revolves around the sun.

Looking at most polls, no matter how absurd the premise is, they all seem to find a baseline or 20% or so of people who'll take the absurd position.

Granted, it's possible that these are all the same people, but I think I'd notice if 1 in 3 people I saw on the street were wearing safety helmets and drooling. I think there's something else going on here.
3 hours a day? I can check a dozen sources during one of O'Reilly's commercial breaks. It's neither hard nor time consuming.

If you're really that time crunched, you shouldn't be watching TV, period. Even putting aside the fact that 1/3 of the time spent watching it is actually watching commercials, the actual information content is astoundingly low, even assuming it's accurate - which it usually isn't.
&gt; i have no control over how people choose to get their information.

Didn't say you did.

&gt; if someone wants to spend 10-15 minutes watching the evening news each day to keep up with world events, that's their business.

Actually, it's *our* business, because they then go an *vote* based on the "information" they get from the TV. I don't feel any sympathy for these people, and I think I ought to be able to expect more from my fellow citizens.
It's called [Argumentum Ad Populum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum), which works because it relies on the [bandwagon effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect), a (evolutionary) cognitive bias.

Or as Joe Goebbels put it, repeat a lie often enough and it eventually becomes the truth.


How can he hate Hispanics? He's actually an illegal immigrant, you know.
