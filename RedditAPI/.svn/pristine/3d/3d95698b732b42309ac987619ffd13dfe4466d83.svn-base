To be fair, alpha radiation and microwave radiation are totally different things.

Alpha particles are helium nuclei.  They can ionize other atoms/molecules, as they're missing their electrons.  This can be a bad thing, though the amount of ionization you get from an alpha particle beam is pretty low and restricted to the surface.

Microwave radiation is a non-ionizing radiation, much like visible light.
On the one hand, I agree with you: Monsanto alone isn't a reason to hate GMOs.

On the other hand, the way Monsanto and other companies making GMO seed use patent law to eliminate competition and independent farmers *is* disgusting.  I do want to protest *that* practice selectively by refusing to buy the products of GMO seeds.  But I can't, because there's no labeling.
Look, I want labeling for GMOs.

It's not because I necessarily have a problem with genetic enhancement (though, if I were buying flour for church, I would strongly prefer non-GMO stuff for liturgical purposes).  It's because I abhor the abuses of the patent system inherent in genetically modified crops.
Indeed, it does.  The thing is that I can't think of any other place that abuses the patent system quite so badly.  Even patent trolls aren't so onerous as the use of the patent system to eliminate competition in the seed business.
I want to avoid purchasing the product of patented seed.  The only way a seed is patented is if it's genetically modified.
Your name is Michael J. Caboose and you hate babies.
Let's see:

* When they prattle on about how the current Republican candidate is the devil incarnate
* When they claim that the Republicans are more worried about their pocketbooks than their rights (while they may believe economic issues are more pressing--and I'd be hard pressed to disagree with them there, most Republicans I know don't really care one way or the other about civil rights issues and are willing to get out of the way)
* Assuming that "Christian" and "Republican" are synonyms (an annoyance of mine on Reddit: a good 40% of the Christians I know identify as Democrats, and another 15% are plainly independents)
* PETA.  Just PETA
* The insistence that everything is a political act, no matter how trivial, mundane, or banal
* Posting image macros to Facebook (okay, *everybody* does this, and it's why I've deactivated my Facebook account until such time as the election is over).
Nyet.
