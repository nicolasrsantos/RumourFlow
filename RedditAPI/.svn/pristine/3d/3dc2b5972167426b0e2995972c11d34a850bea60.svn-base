And even then, when some sort of violence inevitably happens you can\u0027t misinterpret one violent act perpetrated by a crazy as indicative of the whole group, especially after due preventative effort has been made on behalf of the group that\u0027s been victimized.\n\nTL;DR:\nWith all the justifiable cause for stigma being perpetrated by practically every religion right now its the job of any religion to publicly disown and debate anybody that practices their religion in a way that\u0027s aggressively wrong. That means Christianity, Islam, etc. etc. If you want to fight \"ignorance\" promote understanding on every side, not hatred and elitism.

Just as blaming every Caucasian today for what happened to native Americans would be wrong. \n\nThe reason she\u0027s wrong too however is because we\u0027re talking about religion, and one where many have supposedly taken words and phrases out of context enough to distort it\u0027s meaning. At least this is what we\u0027re told after every terrorist attack. \n\nIf those within that faith want to stand out in a positive way and show those who\u0027d perpetrate such attacks, and also show those who\u0027d blame everyone of that faith for those attacks that not everyone within that faith agrees with those attacks, sometimes you have to do more than assume people already understand this. \n\nPeople burned draft cards and millions marched on Washington to protest the Vietnam war. Also large protests across the country over Segregation. \n\nTo show not everyone agrees also helps keep the calm. There\u0027s always going to be some who won\u0027t be convinced. But I can tell you as a 20 something year old during 9/11... Instead of denouncing the attacks, I listened to some on c-span saying how the US brought it on ourselves, and it was terrible, but what did we expect for supporting Israel?  \n\nPublic statements like that while few, made the Internet and 24 hour news channels rotation and stirred the pot greatly. \n\nLook at this clip which is famous for really stoking anger at the time. Palestinians celebrating the 9/11 attacks.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dT1Get5aG1sM\n\nI watched that very day (as most Americans we were glued to the tv for at least a month) and saw the clip air 20 times. Later rumors started that it was fake. Which is false. \n\nhttp://www.snopes.com/rumors/cnn.asp\n\nPeople from every race and religion have committed terrorist attacks in my lifetime. But in the past decade, and even if you were to go back from the day I was born until now, collectively no other religion has had as many people create terrorist attacks against so many civilians than follows of Islam. That\u0027s not a slam against their religion, that\u0027s just a fact. Followers don\u0027t have to apologize for the actions of others, but if they want to help make it so those who might turn to such things don\u0027t because it\u0027s known in be community to be wrong, and if they want to help keep the peace with non Muslims who might create a backlash against Muslims, then yes they should help by denouncing it and helping to point out suspicious behavior when seen. Be part of the solution not part of the problem, silence is part of the problem.

It clearly allows slavery, but it also mentions that \"God\" desires for people to free their slaves, and even ensures these slaves are afforded certain (although limited) rights.

In the modern era, slavery is clearly unnecessary and many modern day Muslim scholars as well as almost all older schools of Islamic study state that slavery should be abolished in every society. So whose interpretation is correct. Even looking at our legal system, many laws are upheld or overruled either based on the \"spirit of the law\" or the \"letter of the law\", and judges have used either reason for making rulings.\n\nLook, I\u0027m not going to defend all aspects of Islam, there is a lot that I disagree with it- but to treat people who believe in it and hold moderate views like they are crazy only further alienates them.

In the modern era, slavery is clearly unnecessary and many modern day Muslim scholars as well as almost all older schools of Islamic study state that slavery should be abolished in every society. So whose interpretation is correct. Even looking at our legal system, many laws are upheld or overruled either based on the \"spirit of the law\" or the \"letter of the law\", and judges have used either reason for making rulings.\n\nLook, I\u0027m not going to defend all aspects of Islam, there is a lot that I disagree with it- but to treat people who believe in it and hold moderate views like they are crazy only further alienates them. Also, consider this- whenever you make such arguments, you are basically telling them that you, who probably hasn\u0027t studied it or practiced it themselves, believes you know better than they do on how it should be followed.\n","duration":"","id":141,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_cxsf9t6","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":140,"links":[139],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"RankFoundry","label":"Common sense and decency can at least find a common ground with logic and reason and when it falls outside of logic and reason, it\u0027s quite easy to point out where and how it does so.

Lol.\n\nAs funny as that is, you\u0027re also revealing a great truth there.  The one time they got their shit together and acted modern - OPEC - they managed to rain hell on western nations and suck a lot of money out of us.  Then they went and spent it on solid gold camels and shit.  Fact is, American and European leaders have the job of outcompeting other countries and the mandate to do so through voting.  It shouldn\u0027t be a surprise to other countries when they do that.  Meanwhile the friggin kings and \"rulers\" of the middle eastern nation act like what they are, which is basically the temporary land owner installed by force and out for himself.  So it\u0027s like the people there wonder why they are going nowhere, but they have no representative to work for them, just one with a vested interest in them not overthrowing him, and then they wonder why our representatives don\u0027t help them get the better of us.  Maybe if they produced something more than strife, and had some leaders that could make good business deals they would be able to have some leverage beyond the ever-dwindling leverage oil gave them for a few decades.  Once renewables hit a certain mark, they are going to have nothing to offer the world, so we\u0027ll just ignore them like they are Africa.  Then they are really fucked.  If North Korea had valuable minerals we needed, you think we\u0027d be letting Kim starve people?  Fuck no, we\u0027d make a back door deal with China and overthrow the place.","duration":"","id":199,"color":"black","redditID":"t1_cxs8tl4","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":198,"links":[197],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Roma_Victrix","label":"Buddhism simply lacks the ideology of jihad in its founding principles and documents.

When an inner city school student is failing it is because of the student and parents. When a suburban school student has the same issues, it is the teachers and curriculum. The sad fact is that the inner city school jobs are less desirable because of the environment and often times pay. The schools that need the most support receive the least and the cycle persists. The parents and students that need the most help don\u0027t acknowledge it and accept it. \n\nAs far as proactive demonstration in the black community, I see several examples in my own city of black church groups, black outreach committees, organizations for peace, and community assistance programs.

However, a significant reason for the rampant growth in the numbers of black children growing up without fathers is Johnson\u0027s Great Society era in the 60\u0027s and the various social programs that followed. Welfare reforms were expanded to help more of the poor, which was a noble idea. The programs were supposed to be temporary until people got on their feet financially but that seldom happened. One of the most favored population segments marked for assistance was single mothers. People can\u0027t stand by and watch kids starve, so it was an easy sell. An unintended consequence was that the system encourages poor women to stay single and have more babies in order to maximize their benefits. \n\nThis problem is not limited to blacks; the poorest of every race in the country soon learned to game the system. Their children grow up without fathers, too. It\u0027s a vicious cycle, and we now have young single mothers being guided by their mothers and grandmothers that lived on government assistance throughout their lives. Often, getting a job is punitive because they would give up more in benefits than they can earn at minimum wage. (Especially when those benefits are augmented by under the table -and sometimes illegal - sources of income.) A small percentage of the poor break out of the cycle to lead productive lives with better lifestyles but the system has killed the American family concept, and crime among the disaffected and fatherless youth has skyrocketed.

This story just broke last week. \n\n[**Leaked Documents Reveal Dothan Police Department Planted Drugs on Young Black Men For Years, District Attorney Doug Valeska Complicit**](http://henrycountyreport.com/blog/2015/12/01/leaked-documents-reveal-dothan-police-department-planted-drugs-on-young-black-men-for-years-district-attorney-doug-valeska-complicit/)\n\n\u0026gt;The Alabama Justice Project has obtained documents that reveal a Dothan Police Department’s Internal Affairs investigation was covered up by the district attorney. A group of up to a dozen police officers on a specialized narcotics team were found to have planted drugs and weapons on young black men for years. They were supervised at the time by Lt. Steve Parrish, current Dothan Police Chief, and Sgt. Andy Hughes, current Asst. Director of Homeland Security for the State of Alabama. All of the officers reportedly were members of a Neoconfederate organization that the Southern Poverty Law Center labels “racial extremists.” The group has advocated for blacks to “return” to Africa, published that the civil rights movement is really a Jewish conspiracy, and that blacks have lower IQ’s . Both Parrish and Hughes held leadership positions in the group and are pictured above holding a confederate battle flag at one of the club’s secret meetings.\n\n\u0026gt;The documents shared reveal that the internal affairs investigation was covered up to protect the aforementioned officers’ law enforcement careers and keep them from being criminally prosecuted.\n\n\u0026gt;Several long term Dothan law enforcement officers, all part of an original group that initiated the investigation, believe the public has a right to know that the Dothan Police Department, and District Attorney Doug Valeska, targeted young black men by planting drugs and weapons on them over a decade. Most of the young men were prosecuted, many sentenced to prison, and some are still in prison.  Many of the officers involved were subsequently promoted and are in leadership positions in law enforcement. They hope the mood of the country is one that demands action and that the US Department of Justice will intervene.\n\nAnother good example is in Ferguson, and the way the local cops were basically extorting the local working-class Black population to raise money for the (overwhelmingly White) local government. [**Even stalwart conservatives have acknowledged that standard operating procedure by the Ferguson PD, as seen in their own internal documents, was ridiculously racist and predatory**](http://www.redstate.com/2015/03/15/many-conservatives-blowing-it-ferguson-doj-report/).\n\n\n","duration":"","id":248,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cxrtz2k","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":207,"links":[206],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Legendoflemmiwinks","label":"in what fucking way???

No, really?\"\n\nSeems like pretty much all Asian Americans get this question. My citizenship by birth is that I am a United States citizen. Nationality is a really nebulous concept, but I consider myself a member of the nation of the United States of America by citizenship, culture, language, and upbringing. My parents were born in China (although my dad grew up in the US from a younger age than my mom). They tend to consider themselves \"Chinese\" even though they have been US citizens for decades. For me, the problem is that even though when people ask my \"nationality,\" the answer they\u0027re looking for is \"Chinese.\" I don\u0027t really feel or think I am Chinese. But at the same time, the way I was raised and my mindset is different than white and black Americans in some ways. I can understand some Chinese, but I don\u0027t speak it. (I\u0027ve actually studied it formally, and I\u0027m more knowledgable about modern Mandarin on a technical level than my parents. My mom knows both Mandarin and Cantonese, and my dad only speaks Cantonese but cannot read or write Chinese.)\n\nTo some people, not being able to speak my ancestral language is terrible or shameful for some reason. I\u0027m proud of my heritage, and I\u0027m very mindful of Asian American identity, history, and politics. I consider myself more knowledgable about race and racism in American society than most people. But for various reasons, I just don\u0027t speak Chinese. Am I not Chinese? I\u0027ve experienced the kind of discrimination and lived the kind of tropes (immigrant family, restaurant family, high achieving student, parental pressure, etc.) that comes with the typical Asian American experience. Yet, because I don\u0027t fit the mold of what people think a Chinese person is \"supposed\" to be, I\u0027m not Chinese. Yet, because I don\u0027t fit the mold of what people think an American person is \"supposed\" to be, my nationality is brought into question.

Its a problem in some parts of the UK, usually with Pakistani immigrants, but with other cultures too. \n\nThe situation goes something like this:\n\nPeople in a rough place have large, extended families. The current generation of working age people are suffering, and want a better life for their kids. So they move. Often its the better off ones that can move, so they are encourage to take their parents, the grandparents, with them. \n\nWhen they arrive in a western country, both the parents end up working long hours. They have few marketable skills but need to support themselves, their children, and the grandparents. Meanwhile, the grandparents double as daycare.\n\nNow, we all know old people. They can be living in a hell hole, but its the only hell hole they know, and it was the best damn hell hole in the world. \n\nSo you have the parents, usually progressive but working multiple jobs and hardly at home, and you have the grandparents who moan about how much better it was back home, how women knew their place and there was none of this promiscuous behavior, how men wernt afraid to stand up for themselves and bring honour to the family, how the state cared about honouring God and took a stand against aggressive secular forces, etc, etc, etc. And you have the kids, young, impressionable, who hear this every day. \n\nAnd as you grow up, you parrot this stuff, which makes other kids, teens and adults shun you. Which affirms what your grandparents say. You argue with your parents who you begin to view as a disappointment, or misguided, because when you talk to them, they are worn down, seemingly converted by western values, never at home. \n\nAt least, this is one of the many theories I have heard, and it seems to hold up to base scrutiny.

Going to guess America, but maybe UK. So here\u0027s my questions - Do you guys talk to each other about Islam and these issues or just pray then go home?  Are there some people who think the headscarf is silly while other say nothing but the eyes should show?   Are there people who think sharia law should replace US/UK law, at least in your communities?  Are there people who express support for the ideas behind the radicals, if not their methods? People who blame the west a lot for all the problems?  If so, those people are more likely to become radicals, and should be reported. That doesn\u0027t mean they will go to jail, just that they will be looked at closer.\n\nThe mafia or a gang replaces normal law and order with their own brand of it.  Wanting Omerta or Sharia, the concept is the same, be it preached by an imam at a mosque or by a godfather at his daughter\u0027s wedding.  That\u0027s what we need, and what we mean when we say we need help rooting them out.  Otherwise, we end up having to look at all the muslims, and guys like Trump gain traction.  But if there really are no signs like that at all, and they act fully assimilated, then you have much larger and more systemic problems, and it\u0027s going to continue like this for some time. But I\u0027ve seen things like videos of guys talking in UK universities about how sharia should be law.  There is video evidence out there of answers to my above questions, and it seems like a lot of people are very open about their extremist beliefs.  They need to be reported, not tolerated or agreed with, and certainly not given a microphone.","duration":"","id":523,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_cxrx3k4","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":522,"links":[521],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"halalf","label":"It isn\u0027t the same as a mafia or gang that operate out in the open and everyone is aware.

I consider myself pretty religious. \n\nThe extent of my personal involvement with the mosque is that I go to the Friday prayers. Friday prayers consists of a short sermon (last weeks topic was forgiveness), do the actual prayer then leave. Since I work and go to pray on my lunch break (like most of the people that show up), the most I have time to talk is to just say hello and quickly get back to my car and drive away. \n\nAside from this, I may show up for a speech or event for a specific holiday (where the speech is related to that holiday) or during Ramadan when we brake our fast together and do the night prayers.

It may be out there, but I can tell you from my own anecdotal experience that if someone were to be an extremest from my local community, most likely no one would know. If they did, they would (and have in the past) gotten reported. One example of this - we a random muslim convert show up one day. He slowly started coming to some weekly discussion groups that were held at the mosque and started getting a little extremist in his views. Our imam told the other guys to avoid him and he was reported as well.

Are there some people who think the headscarf is silly while other say nothing but the eyes should show?   Are there people who think sharia law should replace US/UK law, at least in your communities?  Are there people who express support for the ideas behind the radicals, if not their methods? People who blame the west a lot for all the problems?  If so, those people are more likely to become radicals, and should be reported. That doesn\u0027t mean they will go to jail, just that they will be looked at closer.\n\nThe mafia or a gang replaces normal law and order with their own brand of it.  Wanting Omerta or Sharia, the concept is the same, be it preached by an imam at a mosque or by a godfather at his daughter\u0027s wedding.  That\u0027s what we need, and what we mean when we say we need help rooting them out.  Otherwise, we end up having to look at all the muslims, and guys like Trump gain traction.  But if there really are no signs like that at all, and they act fully assimilated, then you have much larger and more systemic problems, and it\u0027s going to continue like this for some time. But I\u0027ve seen things like videos of guys talking in UK universities about how sharia should be law.  There is video evidence out there of answers to my above questions, and it seems like a lot of people are very open about their extremist beliefs.

This is incomparable to the organized political system of radicalization and directed, trained attacks that define Islamic jihad.\n\nNobody is seriously worried about Christian fundamentalist violence on the scale that would interest national security.

Christian terrorists simply are not a threat.\n\nWe are dealing with repeated, frequent, global, large-scale, institutionalized warfare from Islamic fundamentalists. It is something that needs to be addressed by moderate Muslims. Christians should absolutely deal with Christian terrorism, but the President does not need to make a statement to them, because it is not a realistic ongoing threat.

They try to defend their belief system so it doesn\u0027t take any of the blame, but they have no problem coming out and saying what the person did was wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, when it comes to crimes committed by Muslims the very first thing that Muslims say it that we shouldn\u0027t blame them all. They defend themselves first, defend Islam second, and then only once they\u0027ve wasted their breathe do they come out and say \"Oh yeah, what happened was terrible\" and by then it\u0027s too late to save your reputation.\n\nThe whole \"don\u0027t generalize me\" defense really annoys me. Whether you\u0027re discussing race, nationality, or religion it\u0027s almost always a terrible defense. Most of the time when someone is discussing problems with Islam they\u0027re talking specifically about radical violent Islamic extremists, not your typical left-wing minority Muslim who was raised in America and sipping on his latte at a Starbucks in Seattle. Yet still, that same left-wing Muslim will jump into the conversation to complain about being generalized, as though it wasn\u0027t obvious that we weren\u0027t talking about him. I would commend anyone who joins a conversation to admit that they are related to the demographic in question, yet they too admit there is a problem within their community, and they want to speak out against it. But most of the time people belonging to the demographic in question only join the conversation to defend themselves from being generalized when no such defense was necessary. That only shifts the topic of conversation away from the issue at hand and towards the people who have the complaints, and further complicates what is probably an already complex issue. It also does a disservice by showing people who belong to the demographic in question that they should be spending their time defending their community from so-called \"hate speech\" which is not really hate speech, rather than dealing with the issues their community has. That only makes it harder to affect the kind of positive change needed within that demographic because no one in the community is willing to admit they have a problem in the face of what they believe to be unjustified criticism.","duration":"","id":925,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_cxs8gqr","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":924,"links":[923],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"pissofffuckers","label":"That doesn\u0027t just happen when talking about Muslims.
