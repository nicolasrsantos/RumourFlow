even religious  i dont believe all muslims are our enemies however i do believe that islam is a misogynistic brutal superstitious somewhat aggressively militaristic doctrine thats harmful to humanity at large  i recognize that individual muslims can sometimes avoid literalism and avoid enacting the worst parts of the islamic doctrine  but i also recognize that as long as these moderates support the islamic doctrine as is together with all the ahadith and various hateful and bigoted commentaries by various clerics they are passively and quietly promoting harm  so these folks may be peaceful and reasonable in a day to day life one on one but then when this happensthey wont send letters to this idiot they wont speak up and condemn this hatred and intolerance  these are not good behaviors so its exactly like christianity then only with brown people there are more brown christians than white christians thats not what fox says so you must be lying because fox news loves america and somebody that loves america would never tell anything but the truth i especially love the roundtable discussion where four white people bleat like sheep and the whipping boy is a black juan williams  no subtext there  nope hey  jesus was white with blind hair  and in the words of a former governor if texas if english was good enough for jesus its good enough for me gtblind hairat least its something he could have fixed hehe and there are more asian and black muslims than arab muslims id say its more like the catholics from the crusade era but they never got out of the s and they believe that everyone who is more advanced than them is evil and must die   im sorry where does islam dictate this gtmake war upon such of those to whom the scriptures have been given as believe not in god or in the last day and who forbid not that which god and his apostle have forbidden and who profess not the profession of the truth until they pay tribute out of hand and they be humbled the jews say ezra ozair is a son of god and the christians say the messiah is a son of god such the sayings in their mouths they resemble the sayings of the infidels of old god do battle with them how are they misguidedhe it is who hath sent his apostle with the guidance and a religion of the truth that he may make it victorious over every other religion albeit they who assign partners to god be averse from it sura gto prophet make war on the infidels and hypocrites and deal rigorously with them hell shall be their abode and wretched the passage to it sura its not that simple though  one of the issues were dealing with is that there are different versions of the quran and its not solidified and the differing factions havent drawn their lines in the sands as well  lets say we have the christian bible the catholic bible and the john smith biblebook of mormonall the other books the mormons have  the christians stopped at the bible the catholics added the apocrypha and the mormons changed the bible and started adding books  in the same way we have differing muslim factions  some take only the peaceful parts others add on oh we get to kill people who wont join us  there are doctrines that say if a later writing contradicts a previous writing the later writing takes precedent so theres that  lets take the jesus religions as an example  theyre really well factioned and the differences are somewhat well defined baptists lutherans presbyterians methodists th day adventists etc   so lets say the th day adventists added to their scriptures anyone who doesnt join us we totally get to kill and they start going to town  does that mean the baptists are out murdering  since islam isnt as well divided its really hard to put a name on the people killing infidels in the name of their god  we really just need better organization on the differing branches of islam   it gets worse for westerners trying to observe the area in the middle east many discussions about politics and every day life are clad in religious terms doesnt mean its necessarily religion its just how their idiomatic phrases work but mix that up with a century or so of political oppression and socialeconomicpolitical turmoil and it gets difficult to tell the difference between religious warfare and good old fashioned scuffle over natural resources gt one of the issues were dealing with is that there are different versions of the quran and its not solidified and the differing factions havent drawn their lines in the sands as wellthat is patently and utterly false there is only one version and every copy is bit perfect with another gt id say its more like the catholics from the crusade era but they never got out of the sactually the th century was shared by the fatimid caliphate and the ayyubid dynasty both were quite tolerant to other religions by the standards of the time significantly more than europe and maybe more than current islamic countries how many would let christians or jews server at high administrative levels judging them solely on ability the fatimids did that they also jumpstarted learning and higher education throughout alazharprobably the oldest university in the world was founded under the fatimids the ayyubid founded dozens of schools and presided over an intellectual resurgence especially in medecine and pharmacologythe islamic empires of the time were pretty peaceful all things considered aside from crusaders attacking themtldr th century islamic empires gt st century mississipi thank you my sentiments exactly religion is a corrupting influence on society  except such a doctrine has far more potential to cause great deals of harm in the middle east than the us stability and wealth go a long way to making people not do every damn crazy thing their religious leaders say  gtso its exactly like christianity was  years ago only with brown peoplefixed that for ya except that countries that have a muslim majority pretty much rig everything so that the country is ruled by a theocracy and while there are some people out there that would claim that the us is a theocracy i doubt they have visited many muslimlead countries  except that we installed those theocracies including the one in iran which were now apparently superduperthreatened by what with their zero nukes and zero icbms and allso whos the real villain here the wbcislam fundies that we put into power or us for putting them into power and regressing the entire region  years we didnt install the regime in iran you could argue that we created conditions that allowed them to come to power but they never had us support bahaha yeah they definitely had us support in the form of us sending guns and supplies to them during the height of the cold war to try and keep them from joining the ussr just like we gave guns and training to the taliban in afghanistan to help them gain power instead of a sovietfriendly group we also trained osama bin laden and gave him weaponsour country has been run by complete fucking idiots since jfk please consider that my statement doesnt contradict yours i was merely saying that muslim countries are not like christian countries when you look at where they stand on the social political and economic spectrum  i believe theyre actually very similar the difference is actually how secular the nation is very few nations still exist that are legallyconstitutionally christian and those that do are actually not very different from the middle east at all take a look at south america its being torn apart by violence from cartels and rebellions the only thing keeping it together is secular values like humanismamerica which i assume youre talking about as a christian nation is actually not a christian nation we may have a lot of christians but thanks to the work of our founding fathers and a very small but active atheistagnosticsecularist population we dont have to deal with christian laws being shoved down our throats all the time until recently anyways and the legislation being offered up by the conservatives right now can be easily compared to the legislation the taliban and iranian and saudi arabian regimes enacted that created the hypertheocratic autocracies they have now in my original post i defined christian and muslim nations as countries with a majority of christians or a majority of muslims countries with a majority of christians are generally open to people of all faiths while countries which are a majority muslim are theocracies that being said there are some countries with established christian state religions such as norway greece and even england i dont believe south africa is one of them still i wouldnt consider these theocracies even though wikipedia does   you dont know jack about muslim countries do you im sure there are many i dont know any about and a few i know some about wouldnt claim to be an authority but i have looked a little into the issue  gtso its exactly like christianity then only with brown peoplei would say thats a false equivalence  i think that while there is a lot to criticize about both christianity and islam islam is not in fact exactly like christianity  islam is markedly more brutal and markedly more militaristic and political than christianity is when it comes to central doctrinal writings and how they are usually interpretedi dont know any christian nation or even any currently practicing christian sect that stones adulterers or amputates limbs for theft  while christians have crusaded in the past there is no doctrinal support for crusading in the bible  at the same time there is doctrinal support for military jihad in both the quran and ahadith which are the doctrinal writings of islamso to my mind there are some significant differences between the christian doctrine and the islamic one  i dont like either doctrine but the islamic doctrine is significantly more harmful i dont think you know what you are talking about it is fair to say that some interpretations of islam may be markedly more brutal and markedly more militaristic and political however it is entirely unfair and false to say that none of those aspects apply to any christian i am here to tell you that there are plenty of christians around the world who most definitely hold doctrines which are markedly more brutal and markedly more militaristic and political than average some interpretations  more like most  name a country with a muslim majority that doesnt impose sharia law   name these markedly more brutal and markedly more militaristic and political christian countries id argue americathe fact that we still have debates on separation of church and state abortion homosexuality and to a lesser extent muslimspeople from the middle east in general africanamericans and other such minorities being considered a lesser people than gods apparently chosen kinda hints that our laws are very politically christiantop that off with our allegiance to israel and poor terms with the middle east in particular and youre getting into some christianinfluenced militarization too valid point yet atheist are still free  for the time being  to at least protest and somewhat walk against the grain  not the same as countries with sharia law as the law of the land  turkey would be about the only exception  but just barely  egypt remains to be seen indonesia bangladesh pakistanfirst second and third most populous muslim countries turkey albaniacheck this list for a few more that list doesnt mention sharia its a list of countries with the number of muslims living in it  all the ones youve lists have legal systems strongly influenced by sharia and barely cede ultimate authority to their constitutions and the rule of law and barely have a muslim majority  once that majority increases theyll be just like the rest   of your list pakistan wasnt one you shouldve mentioned  anyone that watches network news knows thats bullshit  i love how so many rush to defend allah and claim were the same as them  show some common sense turkey syria nigeria indonesia nigeria uzbekistan kazakhstan senegal guinea niger burkina faso mali senegal azerbaijan sierra leone turkmenistan chad lebanon palestine albania kosovo cyprus iraq rofl  seriously scumbag redditor  asks for one country that doesnt impose sharia law downvotes post with  islam is markedly more brutal and markedly more militaristic and political than christianity is when it comes to central doctrinal writings and how they are usually interpretedfalse islamic writings and teachings up until the late s when american influence in the middle east allowed the muslim equivalent of the westboro baptist church to gain power are just as peaceful if not more peaceful than christian writingsi dont know any christian nation or even any currently practicing christian sect that stones adulterers or amputates limbs for theft while christians have crusaded in the past there is no doctrinal support for crusading in the bibleactually there is numerous points in the bible call for the death of nonbelievers and the stoning of childrenwomengayssinners it also does directly call for the armies of christ to go forth and war in his nameboth doctrines are equally harmful because both of them require a person to suspend disbelief and cease questioning things so that they can accept a predetermined truth which of course will be delivered to them orally by a person whos spent their lives studying this truth under the tutelage of someone else who spent their lives studying this truth under the tutelage of someone else who spent their lives studying this truth and so on this means theyll accept anything they hear from someone who claims to be an authority on the matter which of course is how abuse always starts gtfalse islamic writings and teachings up until the late s when american influence in the middle east allowed the muslim equivalent of the westboro baptist church to gain power are just as peaceful if not more peaceful than christian writingscorrect even in muslim spain the moors allowed christians and jews to use their mosques for worship during their respective sabbaths the bible does not tell christians to go to war in christs name turn the other cheek bra although the old testament jews did conquer in yahwehs name actually it does oh well sure if you want to choose to read what it says it says all sorts of horrible dehumanizing terrible genocidal brutal things youre supposed to read what it means its a book of love displacedleprechaun except for the gays of course also women stone them and ensure that theyre being quiet in the kitchen respectively thats funny i didnt see anything saying conquer in jesus name anywhere in there i remember jesus saying those who live by the sword die by it and talking shit to peter for cutting that one guys ear off and how his kingdom was not earthly the ot quotes i already acknowledged in my previous post gtislam is markedly more brutal and markedly more militaristic and political than christianity is when it comes to central doctrinal writings and how they are usually interpretedare you fucking kidding me mohammed allowed people to be absorbed into the tribe yahweh regularly said to go into the village and murder every man woman and child as a nonbeliever its like trying to argue whether larry the cable guy is more retarded than gallagher  when it comes to central doctrinal writings and how they are usually interpretedthis is the real key everything else is bluster however i believe that if you read the two side by side without the cloud of theocracy you will find both to be reprehensible and i do find both doctrines reprehensible but not nearly in equal measurein christianity jesus overrides most of the nastiness from the old testament  in islam mohammed positively asserts defends and even performs nastiness from the old testament plus he adds some of his own like limb amputations which as far as i know do not exist in the old testament correct me if i am wrong  jesus stopped a stoning that was about to commence  mohammed would initiate the stonings rather than stop them  im just scratching the surface here  there are lots of differences between jesus and mohammed  jesus preached to turn the other cheek and he practiced what he preached by allowing himself to be nailed to the cross  mohammed became a warlord later in his life  jesus didnt fuck anyone as far as i know  mohammed fucked a  year old girl and he had many wives as well i dislike polygamy too but the  year old is unforgivable  what a differencei cant pretend that islam is equally as bad as christianity just to be politically correct on reddit  ive read enough of the bible quran and ahadith to know otherwise evil is evil is one more evil than the other my guess would be it depends on interpretation jesus did not change anything from the old testamentmatthew  do not think that i have come to abolish the law or the prophets i have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them  for truly i tell you until heaven and earth disappear not the smallest letter not the least stroke of a pen will by any means disappear from the law until everything is accomplished  therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heavenand what do you mean by equally as bad the old testament is pretty damn nasty for instance stoning a child that speaks back to his parents thats pretty damn evil in my book whether or not its more evil i cannot say  but i cannot see how this is any better than the other gtjesus did not change anything from the old testamentno he did  he definitely did change quite a few things  i am well aware of the lines you are quoting too  do yourself a favor and look into it more  he didnt change all of the old testament but he certainly changes big chunks of it and all changes for the better tooif you compare personal conduct of jesus and mohammed there is no ambiguity in my mind about who is morally superior  id be ok with someone trying to emulate jesus but i would definitely not be ok with anyone trying to emulate mohammedits definitely a great shame that jesus didnt summarily cancel the old testament though counting the first second third and modern crusades so we stopped bringing them christianity and started bringing them democracy last week most of the coverage i heard about all these new democracies however was focused on how an islamic majority could spell trouble for womens rights aka our interests in their immortal souls and oil since we clearly dont care about womens rights based on the last  months of our domestic debates gtcounting the first second third and modern crusadesi count doctrines first and foremost and then i count how those doctrines influence the cultures adopting them secondso yes i am definitely counting the crusades military adventures in the name of religion  i count everything when i speak about islam and christianity here for the record there are both dogma and doctrine in christianity specifically catholicism that are not in the bible in catholicism the first vatican council determined dogma such as papal infallibility based on biblical interpretations but men developed this dogma it is not written explicitly anywhere one could certainly argue that there is no doctrinal support in the bible at all for this dogma as many other christian religions do not incorporate popes or papal infallibilitysource some information about catholic doctrines thats a fair opinionmy opinion of muslims stems from a fairly unique introduction to them i was in russia from  to  i was there during  while over there i met several muslim families the first muslims i had ever been exposed to without fail they were always the friendliest people id ever met they were the only nonalcoholics in the country and their families were like something out of a sitcom everyone was happy and loved each otheri was over there as a missionary for the mormons im an exmormon now we used to call muslims dry mormons because their lifestyles were so close to the mormon faith all they needed was a baptismthen i came back to the usaeveryone hated muslims and claimed islam taught the opposite of christianity they hated our freedomi think that was how i started on the road to atheism seeing the blinding hatred christians had for a group of people who were practically the same as them thats a very interesting story did you find that the hatred of muslims was coming from christians in general or mormons specificallyever thought of doing an ama the dislike of muslims wasnt a uniquely mormon thing i returned to the usa in july  less than a year after the attacks the whole country still had a general distrust as time went on most people got over this fear but it took religious groups a lot longer mormons werent any different than your average christian it was my family that most disturbed mearound the time that glenn beck a mormon showed up my family was starting to lose it my parents and my older sisters just ate up everything that man said theyre paranoid and afraid of everything these days my mom keeps trying to convince me civilization as we know it is going to collapse into civil war every  months they believe every insane story ever told about obama they belong to the tea party hand out pamphlets to their neighbors and take gun classesso no not mormons specifically but my parents who are mormonim really worried about them but theres absolutely no reasoning with them the socialists and the muslims are out to get everyone   gt ever thought of doing an amaheh there have actually been a lot of i used to be a mormon ama i dont think id add much that hasnt been said your opinion is about the same opinion i had when living in the largest muslim country as an american christian  even now a great number of my neighbors and friends are muslim  the level of hospitality i have experienced has been unreal  i have even been invited to pray as a christian at their mosqueto be honest the people i have met have been living closer to the lifestyle that jesus taught then most christians i know in the usi dont think it is that unique of an introduction to islami do have significant misgivings about islam as practiced in saudi arabia and some of the pashtun dominated areas but i honestly havent been there myself to have an opinion gtthey wont send letters to this idiot they wont speak up and condemn this hatred and intolerance these are not good behaviorsso you hate all christians because they arent flooding the lords resistance army with letters and denouncing them at every turn correct to the extent that is so yes definitely  i would expect christians to strongly and vocally oppose someone like kony  similarly when various christian antigay bigots go to uganda to proselytize id expect opposition from christians  well guess what  i dont like christians or christianity  its just that islam is worse imo  ideally i dont want any abrahamic religion to be practiced  but if i had to pick either christianity or islam to be my neighboring doctrine of influence id pick christianity over islam any day i think you are confusing religious issues with socioeconomic ones afghanistan is not so much ruined by fundamentalist islam as people there trend towards fundamentalism because their economy education and technology is straight out of the middle agesin western terms try comparing a christian that grew up in manhattan with one that grew up in rural mississippi i disagree with this analysis  i know lots of areas that suffer from abject poverty which dont turn to any kind of fundamentalismi also know fundamentalists which are more harmless the more hardcore they are jains  the more fundamentalist a jain is the more harmless one is yeah but jainism is a mitigating factor that completely opposes violence christianity and islam both have a basis in a god that loves blood for every  you pull out there is a crusade or an iraq we saw whole rural communities working to protect eric rudolph who blew up abortion clinics and a gay nightclub  if there were moderates would you hear them on fox news   do muslim moderates actively fit into the american narrative about islam and its adherents   do you actively search for moderate muslim opinions and viewpoints or do you go by what you see on the tv  gtif there were moderates would you hear them on fox news how about redditgtdo muslim moderates actively fit into the american narrative about islam and its adherents best way to find out is to talk to them yourself  seriously  internet is good for thatgtdo you actively search for moderate muslim opinions i mostly look at doctrinal writings but ive talked to muslims a few times on reddit and offline  im not going to say they are all crazy lunatics thats just false  but plenty of times i talked to muslims i walked away disappointed and sad  they really dont say stuff i wish they would say  and while i can see how they are aligning with the doctrine in my mind i think guys dont you see how the doctrine is inadequate  of course once you become a true believer and you accept that the doctrine is the word of the omniscient god what chance is there to think critically about it  so if you think i dont encounter this in a discussion with muslims youre wronganyway i dont really hate the individual muslims but i am concerned about the doctrine  i worry that muslims promote islam without giving any thought to the impact the doctrine has on humanity  i watched some conversion videos on youtube and almost invariably the reason people convert to islam is not because of the doctrine but because of how good they feel about some muslim friends on a personal level  thats a serious concern because while these folks probably dont read all of quran dont read ahadith dont study muslim history in all their gory details may not know what deobandi thinking is and so on they decide its a good idea to support and directly or indirectly help spread this dangerous doctrine just because they feel good about a person  thats just unsound thinking  if youre going to adopt a religion nice community is a good thing for sure but do check out the doctrine first and foremost and try to understand what it is you are spreadingalso people who hide the ugly side of the doctrine while putting out fuzzy feelings upfront are dishonest salesmen  you know how lots of people get converted  from sufism  and sufis dont talk about amputating limbs  they dont get on a podium and get angry like a lot of muslim clerics  they smile  they are kind  they talk about nice fuzzy mystical stuff  they never mention the harsh side of islam  so on one hand as muslims sufis are probably some of the better people  but as salesmen for islam sufis are the most dishonest salesmen  they put forward the very best of islam and absolutely obscure or even deny the worst  i can even see myself hanging out with a sufi sheikh and enjoying it  but i would never convert to islam  and i would lean over and whisper into the sheikhs ear dont convert anyone to islam just share your spiritual wisdom as is  and thankfully i even know of some sheikhs who do exactly that but not enough imohow many muslims say stuff like this converting to islam is free but if you ever deconvert be careful because a lot of muslims believe that ideally you should be punished by death for apostasy  if muslims talked this way i bet theyd get a lot fewer converts  that and mentioning other similar things about islamic doctrine its often violent history and its often strict and intolerant culture would be an honest sales job at leastthing to remember is while you may just want a bunch of cool buddies to hang with someone else is going to read the doctrinal writings of islam and actually take them both literally and seriously  and then what  what kind of world are we creating sounds like christianity  sounds like christianity as described by ratheism  ftfy no it really sounds like christianity the followers are only slightly less violent due to cultural normals and secular influence  while what you said is true do you really think that the people who violent hate muslims even know about that stuff they were taught to hate it because its different and its our current scapegoat  gtcan sometimes avoid literalismmost muslims are normal people  youre making it sound like normal well to do muslims are the exception rather than the rule the thing is that christianity islam and judaism are all intertwined religions with a shared history and even a shared god and shared holy texts  youve got to understand that most of that bullshit you see from extreme muslims is cultural  not religious  sure they use religious quotes to justify what theyre doing but why wouldnt they  dont christian crazies quote the bible to justify the stupid shit they domost of the muslim extremists come from cultures that condone or used to condone the sort of stuff that makes you sick  christianity has had the benefit of several hundred years of development before islam came around which is why its so splintered and oftentimes progressive  the regions where the muslim crazies come from didnt have the benefit of an age of reason secularization democracy human rights etc  theyre mostly still living in a triballike setting with cultural norms and values that correspond to that sort of lifestylereligion is a part of it but its not the whole picture   look at the muslim societies that have been living in secular countries for the last couple generations  where are the turkish suicide bombers  canadian  german  swedish  im sure you could find some if you did some digging but the point is that theyll be as rare as any other sort of extremist no matter the religion provided that they are at least nd generation immigrantsits easy to blame islam for some of the stupid shit muslim extremists do but if you blame islam youre going to have to label every single moderate muslim a potential extremist  and thats just not right  because most of them arent  you might as well say that since all of the terrorist attacks have been perpetrated by guys in beards  that beards must be the problem  youve got to find more in common between the guys than that  start looking into their upbringing and culturemind you i think the world would be a better place if less people were religious but thats another story gtyouve got to understand that most of that bullshit you see from extreme muslims is cultural  not religious sorry i am in a firm disagreement with you heregtthe regions where the muslim crazies come from didnt have the benefit of an age of reasonwhy not  ever thought about itgtreligion is a part of it but its not the whole picturei agree  but religion sadly is an important part of the whole picture  why so  because religious identity sadly is a very important kind of identity still for a lot of peoplegtwhere are the turkish suicide bomberslets wait  turkey is in the middle of islamization  besides turkeys recent rulers have been militantly secularistic  you cant give turkey  credit for secularism that was not of their free will  its like giving ussr citizens credit for being atheistic at a time when atheism was a government mandate in ussr  thats crooked thinkinggtcanadianwestgt germanwestgtswedishwestgtits easy to blame islam for some of the stupid shit muslim extremists doextremism in the form of militancy is one of the problems  but there are other problems  islamic attitude toward women  islamic attitude toward dogs and liquor  islamic ideas about punishment very brutal and cruel  islamic attitude toward nonmuslims  islamic attitude toward apostasy  in other words even in a muslim society where people dont strap the suicide vests on you can often see the negative influence of islam  and the more muslims in one place the worse it usually goes  muslims are at their best when they are very dispersed in low numbers across the west  but get a bunch of them together especially in the middle east africa or india and bad shit happens  militarism is just one bad dimension of islam  thats the jihad dimension  but islam has plenty of bad dimensions besides militarismgtif you blame islam youre going to have to label every single moderate muslim a potential extremistmoderate muslims provide a comfortable and supportive atmosphere for the more serious muslims  they may not support extremism directly but they support a muslim who is marginally more serious  then the marginally more serious muslims supports another marginally more serious muslim  and so on  so at the end of the day everyone plays a part in making islam what it is  moderates make islam what it is by their silence and apathy in the face of islamic excesses  also even moderates wont criticize the quran  sighi dont want to sit here and pretend islamic doctrine is acceptable when it isnt  i dont want to slaughter every muslim or anything like that  in fact i want the wars to end as much as possible  however i also think we need to speak out about islam  weve got to criticize it the last two terrorist attacks in the west were perpretated by white christians against other natives doesnt matter where you are from people will always end up killing each other gt sorry i am in a firm disagreement with you hereif it was religious why are there moderate muslims  there are hundreds of millions of them  if hateviolenceetc was a core message of islam youd think that more than just a handful of extremists would have picked up the message  theres the same level of the stuff in the koran as in the biblegt why not ever thought about itmany reasons  whats your theory  we didnt see it in asia either are you going to say the same things about buddhism and hinduismgt i agree but religion sadly is an important part of the whole picture why so because religious identity sadly is a very important kind of identity still for a lot of peopleof course it is thats not under dispute  their religion motivates them to kill but what religion wouldnt do the same to a crazy person  christianity sure as hell does it every once in a while  if there was something inherently violent in islams message youd expect crazies from all muslim countries equallyyet they all come from a very specific subregion of where muslims live  hmmgt lets wait turkey is in the middle of islamization besides turkeys recent rulers have been militantly secularistic you cant give turkey  credit for secularism that was not of their free will its like giving ussr citizens credit for being atheistic at a time when atheism was a government mandate in ussr thats crooked thinkinghey in the end there arent any turkish suicide bombers  what about indonesian  all those other countries i mentioned  how come they all come from a very specific part of the world  if it was a muslim thing youd expect them from all corners of the muslim world yet they dontgt westyeah secular right  yet all those countries i mentioned have large muslim populations  if there was an inherently violent message in islam youd expect extremists to be a fairly regular occurance in all those places canada sweden germanygt extremism in the form of militancy is one of the problems but there are other problems islamic attitude toward women islamic attitude toward dogs and liquor islamic ideas about punishment very brutal and cruel islamic attitude toward nonmuslims islamic attitude toward apostasyi know some muslims who live in canada who dont hold any of those attitudes  yet theyre muslim  how is that possiblegt in other words even in a muslim society where people dont strap the suicide vests on you can often see the negative influence of islam and the more muslims in one place the worse it usually goes muslims are at their best when they are very dispersed in low numbers across the west but get a bunch of them together especially in the middle east africa or india and bad shit happens militarism is just one bad dimension of islam thats the jihad dimension but islam has plenty of bad dimensions besides militarismoh boy  i do think that religion overall is a bad influence on people so i cant not disagree with you there but you make it sound like all muslims are extremist nutcases  maybe you need to go out and meet some nice and pleasant moderate muslimsgt i dont want to sit here and pretend islamic doctrine is acceptable when it isnt i dont want to slaughter every muslim or anything like that in fact i want the wars to end as much as possible however i also think we need to speak out about islam weve got to criticize itthe abrahamic religions do need to be criticized and ill be one of the first to jump in  but i wouldnt lump all muslims together and say that theyre all crazy extremists due to their religion  thats a bit insulting  not to mention not trueinterpretation of religion is a fundamental thing at play here  you can interpret an old and outdated religious text hatefully like extremists do  or you can interpret it in a moderate way like most muslims doif the koran is such an evil document thats inherently violent enough to cause all the problems we are seeing with islam then you cant really not say the same thing about the bible  which might even contain more crazy bullshit than the koran does  two old religious texts both filled with violent and crazy bullshit  two groups of people one generally a lot more moderate than the other  a whole bunch of extremists mostly from a very specific part of the worldif religion was all there was to it youd see an equal number of extremists per capita all over the globe  you dont  they all come from a very specific place   you should be directing your research there and trying to figure out why that isedit downvoted by god i just wish the cameraman walked from behind the camera and gave that guy a hug followed by the cameramans mom to give him soup new pajamas storytime followed by sleep for  nights then let him back on camera rinse and repeat i could point to plenty of misogynistic brutal superstitious and aggressively militaristic overtones in judaism and christianity too as an exdevout catholic who almost became a priest i can point to a miriad of misogynistic behavior by catholics on their private lives and by official church policy ive seen how women are treated in strong traditional catholic communities even today even in relatively modern cities in brazil the only things that are absent comparing with radical muslims societies are the acid mutilation and cliterectomy the rest is there the utter isolation of unmarried young women rigorous clothing codes youll still find young women wearing veils and keeping their mouths shut while in mass in certain traditional catholic societies submission to the husband the impossibility of living an emacipated life without being harassed and even raped or beaten depending on the setting   and those more terrrible things mutilations and cliterectomy are present in traditional christian communities in those regions of the world where muslims do them they are ancestral practices from way before their conversion to christianity or islam so its not a question of islam vs christianity its a question of societies that didnt value individual liberties because they didnt went through the historical processes that happened in the west and when it comes to superstitions muslims have nothing on catholics and their veneration of relics you dont even need to canonize someone to have hordes of catholics claiming miraculous cures from their intervention with god by praying to some bones or fragments of clothes and im not even entering the whole topic of evangelical pentecostalism and im also dismaied when moderate christians dont get scandalized when a president of the united states decides to use religious retoric to define whos supposed to be considered a citizen or not refer to g w bushs  one nation under god episode why those moderates didnt write letters to him muslim bigotry isnt more inflexible or aggressive than christan bigotry it just happens that part of the christian world went through the renaissance and then the illuminism and then developed ideas of democracy rule of law equality rechtsstaat etc while the muslim world went through different historical processes including forced secularization which is part of the reason why a reactionary political islamism arised in the th century and a big part of it remained with some outdated cultural practices and retoric  you are on reddit dont you realize that christians and all white males that arent homosexual are evil there is definitely a bit of reddits own flavor of political correctness and groupthink  mostly its not too bad actually you dont know jack about islam  lost me at militaristic doctrine apart from that if you substitute christianity for islam in the above it is also still true  as a former southerner and as someone who has to live in this country i am concerned anytime people with the power to vote dont know what a fact is exactly if obama hid his religion or if there was any real reason to believe he was a muslim besides hearsay from biased sources then id agree with epicgeek but hes denied it hes mentioned his christianity on numerous occasions etc people should know by now that hes not a muslim and its scary that this many people are ignorant to something really basic to be fair you almost need to be a christian in america to be elected whatever his true faith is hes very sensitive to what the people want yeah but there are sources from even before obama really launched on his political career his first book written a few years before he first ran for office talks about his experiences at jeremiah wrights church forget the namei suppose he could be a cryptomuslim but theres about as much reason to believe that as there is to believe romney is a muslim sure i have no evidence either way and i have no real reason to doubt what the man believes im just playing a little devils advocate oh yeah i realized you probably didnt actually believe hes a muslim  what do you mean almost almost i am concerned that people think that where or not the president is a muslim is important gti am concerned that southerners think all muslims are our enemiesmississippian here  all is too strong of a term  most  yep  although i feel the same way about most christians  radical forms of christianity and islam both seek to oppress its society  i find that frightening   this issue should be left up to the states if certain states want to declare a holy war on islam then that is their right thanks ron do you make generalizations about race or sexual orientation as well or is it just entire sections of our country that you like to insult completely honest answergt do you make generalizations about race or sexual orientation as well nopegt or is it just entire sections of our country that you like to insultjust entire sections of our country exactly obama might actually be influenced by muslim doctrine by some definitions that does make him a muslim who gives a fuck he seems like a decent guy i like decent people regardless of what they call themselves  deleted gtno one else has any authority whatsoever to judge his religion affiliation in contradiction to both of those sourcesi disagree everyone has a right to define things however they want provided they give their own definition readily   the population semiretarded or  depending upon which state you choosebut lets not insult retarded people just say they are stupid and ignorant this is what happens when you dont date outside the family you sir are a retard yourself if you think that is true if you cant come up with a better reply than that you need to get out of the conversation  so thomas which dumb ass state are you from al or ms  is a ms area code  no one dates inside their family at all  if you doubt me come here and see   dont make a assumption based on that poll i can guarantee that a large majority of those voters were  they are the large chunk of the ignorant retards that are allowed to vote i am a mississippi resident and college student and all of the younger generation are far less ignorant and better informed than these old fucks  good to hear theres hope go vote then cancel these guys out we all are  right on  people may think that mississippians are retarded which i strongly agree with but it is the older generation that is holding our state back honestly i got down voted to hell i here with my other posts but the young voters will prove that we are making headway btw the only candidate that has been represented on campus is ron paul  tell that to my  year old cousin from montgomery who believes its cool to smoke around his newborn   he cries less when i do there are always those exceptions  they prefer to be called little people true retarded people are as as smart or smarter i think its safe to say that for many of these deepsouth conservatives words like muslim have no meaning other than bad  they know nothing more of islam than they do socialism or fascism or the true definitions of liberalism and conservatism  they just know that according to their media sources obama  bad muslim  bad socialism  bad fascism  bad and liberalism  bad so obama is all of those things wrapped up into one unspeakable bundle of badness cant beamerica is the city on a hill its very foundation is the informed well educated humble and responsible citizenryit is the apex of democracy it isim sorry i cant i just cant hysterical laughter deleted my rule of thumb is think of how stupid the average person is now realize that half of the population is dumber than thatthen cry credit to carlin  whenever someone says this i cant help but think of the dunningkruger effect  yeah really i find it similar to the conceit that most people have in thinking that they are a vastly superior driver than everyone else on the road the dumb ass that just cut you off is thinking the exact same thing  of the time ive always wondered how the dumb half of the population interprets this saying thats not how averages work deleted youre technically right but i think intelligence is a bell curve where the median and mean are very close to each other so its still a very useful saying that is more pleasing than think of how stupid the median person is however one can assume that intelligence  has a normal distribution so it is safe to say that half the population is dumber than the average person i was going to say what bbg said but he already said it basically iq tests have scores defined so that average is  furthermore it has been shown that iq has a global normal distribution so in this case median  mean also average  mean mean is one example of an average and there are several varieties of mean as well measure of central tendency  average in the qualitative sense get out of your math book registered republicans make up  of the electoratein alabama  of that means about  of alabama believes this  this is correct  only if you assume that  of independents and democrats believe obama is a muslim  that assumption sounds unreasonable to me gtthis is correct only if you assume that  of independents and democrats believe obama is a muslim  its a lot more reasonable than the assumption that all of alabama is registered republican  woah woah guys back off guys basementdad needs more space retards are the most accepting and nonjudgemental people youll ever meet dont compare them with conservatives very true i apologize you mean alabama republicans no i mean retards thats only republicans mind you  of republicansthe article never told us what democrats or independents thinkpopulation of alabama millionpopulation that voted mccain in  million of those who voted for mccain percentage k of the total population at least  of alabamas population is idioticat least this number could be much higher but the data is incomplete i also did not take into account republicans who did not votemainly because i could not find any specific data on the number of registered republicans id be interested to see if the group that believes obama is a muslim would also consider themselves very religious  in my very unscientific study of peers it seems the more religious one is facts become less important  blind faith bleeding over into other areas of life can anyone put together a combined graph of states ranked by quality of education and percentage of that states population who thinks obama is muslim andor not a naturalborn american citizen id bet  karma that theres a strong consistent inverse correlation ie the less educated a state is the more people believe that as an alabamian i feel like that statement shows just as much ignorance as the people of which you speaking of in the first place if you then asked the question do you think obama is islamic youd get a different ratioim amazed by how many people think theyre different religions gt  of republicansread the fucking title gtactually its not  of the entire population the title says its only  of republicansftfy so it doesnt sound quite so dickish although i guess if i were naked and famous i might be unnecessarily condescending too asshole im saying almost half the population is retarded based on what evidence   certainly not this article you commented on   if you think about it that whole controversy about his old pastor was a little to convenient remember also he went to grade school in indonesia you might want to see the requirements for a child to go to school there during that time its better to have had a crazy baptist pastor than to admit having been muslim at some point in your life right im not saying he is muslim now but you cant deny he was brought up as one early on is that a bad thing no but others might not be down with that no matter how dumb they are is it right to deny your past and lie about it thats another thing altogether now  gtremember also he went to grade school in indonesiaindonesia is a secular country and quite aware that religious antagonism is its greatest weakness  the grade schools there are predominately secular with the exception of the religious ones of course  particularly in jakartawhat the school was like in indonesia that obama went to i dont knowand you cant be muslim at some point in your life the majority of the population is muslim his father including his step father were muslim how do you think he was raised in a predominantly muslim country im not saying he was because there isnt enough information to prove anything one can only speculate and given anyone smart enough to run for president would definitley have an intrest and blurring these facts facts that could prove if he ever was and yes you can be muslim at some point in your life its called conversion many politicians claim a religious background in order to gain more votes what better way to draw attention away from this background than to have a crazy ex pastor now mind you i dont really believe this cause its pretty far fetched but still a possibility and that is why there is a majority in the south who probably think the way they do people jump to conclusions we all do it  this is why i dont believe in that  nonsense  my ass wtf  are you even talking about what am i talking about i am talking about how most people are dumbasses i know i was one until recently i think you give yourself far too much credit as im pretty sure the empirical evidence shows your are a dumbass it is possible that barack hussein obama is indeed a muslim all you have to do to become a muslim is say the followinggtthere is only one god and it is allah and muhammad was his messengervoila if you say that youre a muslim there are no other entry requirementsit is also permitted for muslims to lie about whether or not they are muslim if they are in lands they consider hostileobama acts like hes a muslim and for all you know he might be a closet muslim gays used to have to be in the closet toowhen people are asked this question they are stating their belief that barack obama is a liarand since he is they just may be right about whether or not hes really a muslimwhich is besides the point he acts and governs just like a muslim would lol because hes totally forcing us all to eat halal and pushing for an antigay marriage amendment obama is on record as being against gay marriageyesalso serves lots of halal meals at the white house so then santorum is really muslims then he doesnt act like one but obama does hahaha how does one act like a muslim you know because they all act the same and all hold the same political views gthow does one act like a muslimooooh say instantly apologizing for muslim deaths when a us soldier kills  random muslim women and children  but not apologizing when a muslim soldier randomly kills  christians say at fort hoodthat would be one wayor say  getting all sorry when muslims die at the hands of his crazed jackboots but having nothing whatsoever to say when muslims lob  rockets into israel attacking jews in a holocaustal fashionthat would be another way he acts muslim and also nazilikei have no idea if he actually is a muslim or a nazi and neither does anybody else but he acts like both and so if i was in alabama and a pollster asked me if i thought he was a muslim id have to say that on balance since we cant actually know for sure that yes i think hes a muslim and a nazi and is lying when he claims not to be kind of like he lied when he said hed close gitmo or was against the patriot act or the bush tax cuts for rich people or ovensbut im evidencebased others arent and are content to just trust lying democrats but hes probably not actually against it hes probably putting on that position for political gains also serving halal meals to respect guests does not make you a muslim gtbut hes probably not actually against it hes probably putting on that position for political gainsso you admit hes a liar then  and thus could easily be lying about whether or not hes actually a muslim and only claiming not to be for  as you say  political gains and so what if he is muslim does that hurt us muslims are just as bad as christians in many regards its just that theyre mostly brown people here that you dont like them gawd if he is in support of gay marriage as i think then he really isnt that radical a muslim if he even is one gtand so what if he is muslim does that hurt usapparently so since youre all so quick to deny it even in the absence of personal knowledge revealing your latent islamaphobia gtmeanwhile the poll that twothirds alabama republicans interracial marriage legal compared with  percent mississippi republicansyup ok my jaw literally dropped on that one bloody fucking shit loving v virginia was  fucking years ago and these tardholes are still fighting that battle consider my mind boggled for the night these tardholes are still fighting the civil fucking war  of them are at least now somewhere in the th century thats progress that is ridiculous as a southerner i am greatly offended by your ignorance  as a northerner who moved south for work opportunities its kinda true not all of you are but there are enough that do that it cant be shrugged off as a really tiny minority sorry but southerners are generally more idiotic and ignorantbig time hicks hillbilliestheyre dumb how about instead of calling hollaback ignorant you realize that a statistically significant portion of your friends and neighbors still believe the races should be separate in marriage  that is true ignorance isnt it about time you fly a confederate flag and reenact gettysburg why would a proud southerner reenact the battle of gettysburg why indeed im currently living with my parents in alabama and the racism is just randomand comes out for no reason for example i mentioned having someone over for company and my mom said the house looks like a nigger house just fucking out of nowhere not messy not untidy no had to make a fucking racist reference  my best friend growing up is mixed blackwhite and doesnt really go for black chicks guy is one of the most fantastic people youll ever meet but due to where we live he had trouble finding women whose parents wouldnt threaten murder for their white daughter dating a black man shit of it is im sure he got plenty of flak from the other side for being so light skinned  he even has green eyes  i grew up with him my parents know him and how great he is hes currently engaged to a white girl one of the most beautiful women ive ever seen in my life my mom disagrees due to the race issue i told her honestly she should be fucking ashamed of herself for wanting to deny someone so great happiness just because of his skin color  ive told her many times that i love her but that i wont shed a tear when her generation and their mindset is laying in the fucking ground rotting  i justdont understand the hatred i cant understand it must run deep deeper than ill ever know for her to feel that way toward someone id be happy to have a daughter of mine marry im a  year old white male in alabamai dont understand the racismbut it runs deep and is going nowhere not sure how i won my freedom from the trap but i wish i could help others do the same  there are ignorant racists here raising ignorant bigot kids oftheir ownand it breaks my heart  its  called  guilt  it is eating the western world alive from the inside out  gmorning decline of the american empire  dont worry we canucks are not far behind theyre also still fighting roe v wade not surprised and i bet you can find some fighting brown v board of ed  dont even get them started on lawrence v texas we have presidential candidates still fighting that one it is still mainstream republican not limited to mainstream mississippi  i remember hearing about a justice of the peace somewhere in the south mississippi denying a marriage license because the couple was interracial and he was worried about the potential children that happened only a few years ago it was in   deleted gt it might be technically illegalit cant be technically illegal since  years ago the supreme court declared it was legal my issue is more with the  of mississipi republicans thinking it should be illegalgt in any case if it is still on the books it is entirely unenforcedand if somebody tried it would fall ok let me amend that it could still be on the books again because it is a pain to update the damn thing and unenforced because that would be illegal as to the people its shitty as hell everywhere has their backwards yokels  yeah its like how blowjobs are illegal here in virginia in the sense that the law is unconstitutional but on the books my jaw dropped when i saw that in preparation for a blowjob this is a poll about whether people think it should be illegal not the current law roughly half of ms republicans hate interracial relationships so much they think they should be illegal which laws are currently on the books is irrelevant thats what the take back america bumper stickers mean btw  howard dean used to say lets take back americaour country im pretty sure i even had a bumper sticker that said that so i dont think thats really a fair accusation what if some native americans started puttting this stickers on their cars this is why we need to invest in education good luck getting that to happen apparently education  liberal brainwashing the powers that be keep our education system stinky because they dont want citizens to be critical thinkers even better they convince people they dont want education that and people are greedy and as soon as they get out of school they decide they shouldnt be taxed for other peoples education yestheyre very good at what they do unfortunately  lol and santorum calling obama a snob and that obama and the elites want to tell you how to live your lives  ah sad the problem here in the south is when you mix education and differing moralityie things like interracial marriages gay marriage creationism etc  its a shamebut people here get real uppity when you start messing with the way things ought to be its what makes religion so dangerouspeople are raised to believe blindly and it just snowballs  its what makes freewill so dangerous these people are expressing their rights to be stuck in the damn civil war at least the pope and pals have progressed to the th century pretty much i dont know if education is the answer this is deep hatred that goes back generations and the current generation are thought to think and act the same way i doubt they even know why they hate to them its probably how things have always been and how it should always be its probably a way for them to identify themselves but saying we are better than them if you do any type of poll and the demographic you are specifically polling is alabama republicans you are going to get some pretty stupid answers man you have no idea well actually now i guess you do   this novelty account seems limited in potential i dunno i think more and more is going to be his fault as we closer to the primaries and then the election overall white vote  mccain  obama white vote mississippi mccain  obama white vote alabama mccain  obama  so did white people only vote for mccain because he was white i am black person and i hate when white people say the reverse of course not they voted for him because he wasnt blackjk jk  but really they voted for him because hes a dinosaur who will remind them to be scared of people not like them which is much easier to take from someone who is like you just bring up herman cain next time somebody says that did any black people support him yeah i agree or michael steele for that matter i live in baltimore and he didnt even win here when he ran for the senate however facts dont stop morons in the world and on reddit for saying stupid shit constantly the red portion of this mapcorresponds pretty well to appalachiai wonder why they supported kerry and not obama sort of but western nc and the entirety of wv are also definitely part of appalachia not to mention the fact that everything from the middle of tn and westward so ar ok etc isnt appalachian at all i hate it too when people say that too  the thing is if you dont like blacks then you already vote republican and generally if you are black you already vote democrat  there are very few people for whom obamas blackness changed their decision  obamas blackness made people who were already inclined to support him significantly more likely to actually go out and voteits a question of turnout rather than support reasonable point i think obamas race probably cost him some votes among racist democrats especially in states like west virginia but overall the boost in turnout among black voters and young voters probably meant it was more of a positive than a negativealmost all of the people who are stone cold racists and would never vote for a black guy are republicans anyway i live in mississippi my next door neighbor told me that he didnt vote for obama because he is black happens more than youd think here and among people you would otherwise have respected got a friend who saw no end to the racist rimbass music jokes when obama got elected niggers this welfare that people just get stupid here when race comes upas ive said elsewhere it runs deepso deep and theres so much ignorance and hatred toward black people here and it comes from sources that id expect better frompeople that i call friends and with whom i no longer discuss politics and religion  people that i call friends and with whom i no longer discuss politics and religionwow  arent you the brave one heaven forbid you actually confront them and explain that you cannot possibly  be friends with people that full of hateyou play right into their hands when you no longer discuss things that matter  dont you see  they take that as a win  the only way to move beyond this antiquated way of thinking is to keep talking about politics and religion  in fact let them talk  they will often embarrass and contradict themselves and paint themselves into a sad little corner from which even the thickest ones among them will fail to find their way out of without at least a bit of selfreflection do you have a link for this information i dont doubt it i just want a different source than a reddit comment  thank ye even the black vote was more concentrated in alabama  nationwide alabama i hate my state ummmmis this honkywill from the io forum  did i just find you on reddit  you did who might you be get a room you two i went by hilikmed whitney fellow alabamian like the name sorry for the unfortunate state we are in i am one of the  damn straight brethren i dont think i could live somewhere where only  of the white people arent total rednecks to be fair the national average for voting republican is ish we have rednecks but we also have notrednecks which is at least according to the numbers i just pulled out of the air given the choice between a wellspoken educated man who started his career helping poor people or the guy who went from moderate to conservative and lost all his principles just before his campaign funding went through the roof id say the black guy was a solid bet  i always bet on blacki never bet on anything i just imagined the best image for thata very suave guy in a suit with nice designer glasses says always bet on black like wesley snipes then clears his throat instantly drops his shoulders and does the one finger nerd glasses push and says oh but really i never bet on anything its a series of mathematical equations that deliver the best statistical chances for success in any situation i love that film passenger  but can you imagine if the star had been a white guy and the line had been always bet on white just before he dispatched a black guythat would be proper kkk stuff interesting  in alabama and possibly in miss white democrats voted more for mccain and the voting record for blacks in these locations is more lopsided than for whites cant really blame them several centuries of continued political repression will do that oppressionalso i think people are more likely to vote for the candidate they relate to most point honestly i am dead shocked he got that much of the white vote  knowing the past of mississippi and how it tries to cling to it shocks me    i betcha that  didnt tell too many of their friends who they voted for overall  percent of black people voted for obama  percent of black people in alabama voted for obama percent of black people in mississippi voted for obamawhats your point blacks historically vote overwhelming for democrats period not just black ones i would imagine the fact that republicans try to fuck over anyone not a million probably has a lot to do with it  this is true blacks began to transition over to the democratic party around the time of fdr it was in  to be exact fdr won  percent of the black vote nationally and upwards of  percent in places like new york this was in comparison to  when most blacks voted for hoover roosevelt continued to win similar percentages in  and  it wasnt until truman ran in  though that most blacks self identified as democrats truman actually beat roosevelts  record winning  percent of the black vote in   thank you for elaborating samuel gompers and yet my local news found story after story of elderly black people registering to vote for the first time in their lives in  of course because they couldnt at all be isolated incidents in a large population that are only coming to light because of a need to control media narrative now could they white democrats in the south may not be democrats according to todays definition they could be hold outs from the s s s when no southern whites were republicans  they vote for republicans now but never bothered to change their registration  check out and travel back in time for proof  edit so your claim that the voting record is lopsided isnt really taking into account the context if your point is that more white democrats voted for mccain than black democrats voted for mccain its only racist if whites do it the policies of republicans are objectively harmful to the majority of blacksthe same cannot be said about democrats policies to the majority of whitesso no it isnt racist for blacks because their vote is clearly aligned with their interests where the converse is not necessarily true for whites voting in such ways  but democrats are taking from hardworking white folks and giving to lazy black folks that hurts white people rick santorum said so you arent going to understand this but ill try anyway politics is zerosum  it is all redistributive  the policies of democrats will generally hurt white people and will generally help minorities relative to those of republicans  so a white person wanting to vote in his own selfinterest will probably vote republicanbut this is all irrelevant  are you really trying to say that voting for a member of your own race is racist if that candidate doesnt directly benefit you  gtpolitics is zerosumthis is a false assumption that the right wing has been preying on for  years if someone is winning someone else must be losing so if the blackswomengayspoor are winning youre losing and its simply not true an injustice anywhere be it social injustice economic injustice or moral injustice is an injustice everywhere eliminating those injustices leads to a more fair open and tolerant society which benefits us allfor a specific concrete example look at the minimum wage rightwingers scream that its government interference in the free market and that it raises prices and the unemployment rate and is therefore robbing those who have to pay those prices but it also provides many workers with the legal protection of a living wage provides a bottom to the income ladder which boosts nonminimum wages and benefits the economy by having more cash flow thereby increasing economic activityeconomics is not a zero sum game the economy is always growing or shrinking and history shows that it grows faster the more people are allowed to participate in that growth lets be clear here economics isnt a zero sum game because the market can grow but politics is by its very definition the question of how the proceeds of that market are divided in other words who gets what  it is inherently redistributional and hence will always have zero sum components to it even if some individual actions are largely winwin  lets take your minimum wage example  increasing the minimum wage increases inflation and costs across the board  it prioritizes the poor over the middle class and it picks the pocket of anyone who has money saved up  most people are better off but not everybodythere are almost always winners and losers in politics  the market can grow for everyone but a person or groups share of the profits have to come at the expense of someone elses share fyi you dont have to realize youre a racist to be a racistyoure a racist no youre a racist  see i said it so it must be truejust how bad at argumentation are you why argue with those who hold indefensible positions its not like youre going to become unracist from a reddit debate now is it we downvote and move on because you are not worth our time oh boyis it time to balkanize yet deleted thats not misleading  thats the point since i typed out a reply to his comment but then couldnt post it because he deleted ill just leave this hereim not sure why its misleading  but here are a couple ways to put it in contextfirst the  election where bush did better than mccain among whites nationally but worse than mccain among whites in ms and al overall white vote in  bush  kerry  white vote in mississippi bush  kerry white vote in alabama bush  kerry second the state obama lost by the widest margin in  was wyoming  he lost the white vote there   so no its not just because ms and al are conservative states they were just voting for someone they identified with and who looked like themhey if its alright for blacks to do it whos to say its not alright for whites  oh right double standard pig liberals thats who false equivalency is false and have a downvote for needless insults once mississippi prevents state alabama ranking  terrible stupid best thing about alabama  at least its not mississippi yup our unofficial state motto still holds true thank god for mississippi i thought that was arkansass motto thats everybodys motto im in arkansas and i think youve stolen our motto  south carolina thanks both of you for your service it code nigger they use those words they cover with muslim see also terrorist sympathizer unamerican and marxist kenyan bingo especially since there is a sizeable population of muslims in africa so they can combine the exotic threat with the ageold race issue im curious to why beliefs keep coming up th year shouldnt we general idea what believes now even if he were a muslim would that disqualify him from holding public office hell yeah it would muslims arent real amurricanstm brought to you by carls junior carls junior is hardees in the south im so hungry guitar riff  banjo riff first nine notes of that song from deliverance no because were a secular nation although if he got in a public office there probably will be people claiming that he cheated polling shows that a muslim stands a better chance of election in the us than an atheistsecular country my arse deleted at this point saying you believe in the imaginary friend is still essential to getting elected in the us so not too much shame can be attached to that right now what if the skyfairy is cheesecake ice cream flavored and yes coldstone creamery does have cheesecake ice cream and its even better than you could possibly imagine teach me your ways o wise one isnt strawberry cheesecake a fairly standard haagen dasz flavour no clue never heard of that brand i doubt its the uncommon in reality it was just something i had recently that more than exceeded my normal pessimistic expectations never heard of one of the two biggest global superpremium ice cream brands with annual sales in the billions of dollars owned by general mills gotta have it personally i dont think your religion should make a blind bit of difference if you want to believe in fsm go right ahead just dont campaign on spaghetti based issues because they have no relevance to a functional government deleted deleted deleted deleted deleted because the republican party lacks any form of actual ideology other than guns religion war and taxes outside those  things they are merely for the most part an opposition political party of antiliberalsim which means that they need things to be opposed to  hmm interesting racism doesnt have an expiration date screamingthensilence has it figured out or the image macro he took the quote from figured it out dont care where he got itheshe gets it so i get it too no surprise there i lived alabama while i met great people one which remains friend to this day they serious problems alabama to of the greatest orthopedic surgeons the world politeness abundant but youre going to hear multitude white customers refer to their black servers boy youre going to disturbing level poverty extremely segregated communities the south problems disregard retarded the uneducated bigots victims impoverished circumstances racist society that coalesced making them easy prey political forces that to capitalize vulnerable people with preexisting prejudices is it somehow preferable to hear hateful views in a polite manneri get what youre saying about poverty and culture and there being a complex interaction that causes this sort of ignorance and behavior however that certainly doesnt make me an apologist for it i dont think people are properly incensed i referred to the politeness as distinctly separate from the racism i witnessed racism is inherently impolite the two qualities of racism and politeness can be and are concurrently present in the same communitycitystate also in the same city birmingham as the greatest orthopedic surgeon is one of the best cancer centers in the country at one point huntsville had the highest number of phds per capita in the nation was it ever in the world im not sure  it is absolutely amazing to me the amount of intelligence and ignorance that can exist at the same time in this state in the same zip code in some cases they just exist so separately i think i mean we mingle and interact when needed but in the endto each their own  it really is a shameso much potential wasted in fear and ignorance  gtalabama is home to one of if not the greatest orthopedic surgeons in the worldwhile im glad to see that alabama has a competent medical practitioner i wasnt expecting to see it brought into a race relations discussion it was in response to the idea that alabama is just a town full of retards which was the sentiment conveyed in virtually every top comment thanks though  gtstate full of retardshad to sorryand hey people think that i must be a stoner because im from california im using alien blue did i make a typo woops in advance if i did  alabamian here its such a shame isnt it  southern culture has such potential but racism is beaten in so deep im afraid itll be a long time before were free of it everything you said is absolutely correct and i hope others that read your comment will pick up on that you werent trying to connect politeness and racism  it is disappointing and it just makes me angrier to see groups like americans for prosperity see koch brothers just exploit southen states turning wellmeaning people into foot soldiers to combat their own interests it reminds me of current tvs documentary two americas profiling a southern family surviving on food stamps and unemployment who oppose social programs like food stamps and unemploymenton another note roll tide  who gives half a fuck which imaginary friend this fucker has most of alabama and over half of mississippi apparently  i cant tell people here that i dont believe firmly in a god theyll hate you look down on you pity you and use it as the excuse for all your lifes problems for example i have cancer people say they have me on prayer lists and are talking to god and whatever else in my head i think thanks for the sentiment but i dont dare express that i think theyre wasting their time i mean ultimately those people mean welli just wish they would channel it through something that actually helps people  true as well as a large portion of the general voting populace in this country theres a difference between being aware or thinking you are and caring generally speaking anyone who cares enough about it to think that obama is muslim even though he claims he isnt also cares enough to not vote for him because of it but probably wasnt going to vote for him anyway same imaginary friend different name deleted i mean i dont care what he is he could worship cthulhu for all i care as long as it doesnt show up in his job performance im cool the fake obama that theyve created reinforced faux talk radio working there that will change their minds its worse than semiretarded its purposeful intentional ignorance with racism sprinkled top i think the fake obama works so well because they want to believe its true its like theyve created some sort of man made out of straw  if only there were a name for what theyre doing my father school fiscal republican incredibly intelligent man retired doctor  thinks obama secret muslim it boggles the mind fox news their job alright either hes secret muslim secular atheist socialist marxist hes radical jeremiah wright christian anarchist you them apparently when i run across this with my own family members i dont bother with facts  you cant fight emotions with facts  you have to fight emotion with emotion  i shame them to death and say something like you have to be pretty gullible to believe such an easily debunked talking point  no one ever wants to appear foolish for believing a fish story  shame will make them turn the dial and pick up a hobby or something  i wish we goad the south seceding that the it itd cutting dead leg texas was talking about it there for a while but it was just that talk

obama muslim citing gadaffi source ampamp reminds me of the all the people who claimed bush said that god told him to invade iraq the source was an english translation of a hebrew newspaper

to stop with the crazy obama theories either it was a palestinian officialactually he claimed bush told him god inspired him to invade afghanistan and iraqit was on occasion muddled together with the actual general that framed the iraw war in religious term william g boykinthere was some debate that the governments avoidance of criticising the general could be understood as implied agreement

know whichever mormons muslims illuminati freemasons  hes going the full pack little were controlled the silence when people speak out against freemasons i can only assume they think masons shouldnt

entertained me you sheered the wool from over my sheep eyes i am now a practicing member of the timecube alliance under the guidance of our lord yahweh wow i pretty this guy psychiatric help i believe that he is what is referred to in the psychiatric industry as completely batfuck loco i believe he is referred to as finally able to afford that second home in maui death therapy bob you and your medical terms is that latin or something awake is actually the terminology  only when his eyes are open his youre talking to the man himself creepig the one who liberated all our minds from the illuminatimuslimmormon plot to rob us of our glorious leader moammar qaddafi well this is awkward so i take it youre not a sheeple then zzzzz for the sake of humanity im hoping he is just an awesome troll his posting history says otherwise nah sorry to disappoint you so youre telling me that a person who only links to youtube videos whenever asked for evidence can actually be serious and believe theyre right  hey guys look whos here oh subredditdrama you bestest internet friend gt you are my bestest only internet friend fine i see how it is not real rcirclejerktroll its extremely hard to tell them apart hes too crazy to be a troll this is pure grade crazy    posting history says otherwise poes law comes into play here methinks dont care hilarious regardlessdmloled he just posted in my citys subreddit reminding people to vote in the republican primaries in the comments someone mentioned dems or independents registering republican to vote for the lesser of two evils or ron paul he responded with literally the exact same stuff he was saying in this thread not sure what that means the guys rchristianity welcoming tolerant somehow turned that the religious subreddits mature ones until you talk about the mormonmuslimilluminatefreemasons rule  do not talk about the mormonmuslimilluminatifreemasons gtuntil you tell them the hidden truth about the mormonmuslimilluminatefreemasonsftfy it actually took me quite a while to realize that the post was made in rchristianity it only clicked when i saw atheist flair replying to a cross obvious troll obviousactually reading posts serious wow omg qaddafi killed the illuminati was going to them yet he outs them on reddit all the same risking his life so brave well of course hes protected by the three jew bankers and the reptilians  gtobviously there lot uninformed people there this post to votespeople downvoted me let insult them well shit im converting to mormonism ive wanted to god i dont know that ive ever seen any of my mormon friends beating the drum for judas and i hate to break it to this guy but judas was an apostle pretty sure all his other claims are halftruthslies and or truths removed from context and explanation for the purpose of portraying them as crazy or different meh the sadfunny part is that hes probably not trolling dont ruin this for me i want to be a god oh no that part is accurate so its all goodyou just have to you know never drink alcohol coffee or most teas smoke unless you have glaucoma i guess pay  of your income until you die go to  hours of church every sunday and generally follow all their other rules and be a good person then you might qualify to be a god when you die maybe i was with you up until the be a good person partthat seems like more effort than its worth what do we do when were a godwell now nobody can tell you what to do so you can do all the stuff you abstained fromyay gtpay  of your income until you dienet or gross hmm id have to ask i think the answer is whichever you feel good about but lean gross this is accurate  that makes no sense  what if you are taxed  its either but the actual doctrine teaches  of your increase which most take to mean gross including monetary gifts etc  of all your monthly earnings so gross that is though excluding fast offering which you pay for the amount of food you wouldve ate for that sunday depends on the interpretationhere its simpler because income taxes are paid by the employer as opposed to usa where people calculate and pay their own taxes  i dont get your quip about glaucoma as for tea its not most teas its teas made from camellia sinensis because it contains caffeine and doesnt apply to herbal teasnot a mormon glaucoma implies they would be smoking marijuana for medical reasons although even then they might have an aversion to it as a banned substance good ol ephedrine well with my new selfrealization program you can gt that blacks are subhuman because they did not fight in a intergallatic war prior to earth on the side of goodi thought the former mormon doctrine on black people was that dark skin was the mark of cain or something or possibly the curse of ham it was certainly vile enough but the convenient thing about having latterday prophets the lds church holds that the first president has a direct line to god available is that you can update church policy whenever you like without much fuss im reasonably confident that at some point in the next  years the church leadership will make an announcement to the effect of oh hey so it turns out god says gay people are actually ok after all whatever the veracity of his claim the idea that mormons believe this is pretty prevalent  living in the south you see a lot of antimormon prejudice  i dont like mormons myself im gay but its always amusing to me to see the infighting   gtyes we believe that we become like god if weve followed gods commandments not incorrect then  that part is not incorrect  mormons believe that as gods spiritual children they will eventually come to be like him this the kind drama that to posted often i was ayn rand loving foaming the mouth libertarian college i understand why ron paul attractive to these guys but politically apathetic adult i roll eyes the reloveution it attracts the fringe fringe supporters who religious devotion to ron paul the loudest voices support website i to the conspiracy theorists who think youtube video masterstroke thanks i will try and find more delicious drama for you my favorite claiming the th amendment unconstitutional state ratified it for ron paul supporter that uses the word unconstitutional word very understanding what the constitution contains that was my favorite part too by definition an amendment cannot be unconstitutional he also goes on a lovefest about khaddaffis awesum socialist programs like free electricity which is pretty curious for a paulbot ron paul seems to think any amendment after the th is unconstitutional gtron paul seems to think any amendment except the th is unconstitutionalftfy

yeah you dont want obama you really don want obama because hell get rid of your medicare you might as well say goodbye to it i dont know if youve done any research on obama or not but he is a muslim if he had his way wed be a socialistic country pay attention to fox news  the head of the clay county gop told the st augustine record that the woman was offscript completely embarrassing admission of script inadequacy  st augustine record photo richard french flickr","commentContent":"i live the clay county line i that the majority people i the area maintain this way thinking my history teacher obama black hes muslim to her ignorance i im white im christian which bood the class it was worth it your class is dominated by idiots tell me about it sometimes i think im the only one in the room with the ability to think for myself  is it a public school is your teacher violating some teacher rule where they cant talk politics or bring their own political ideology into the classroom no its a private school in the backwoods of the bible belt sadly private schools can do pretty much whatever they want  teacher hes not a muslim hes an atheist pretending to be christian hah this is why i forever lol and people i knew who would brag on and on about their parents caring enough to pay to send them to the christian school in the state of florida private school teachers dont even have to be certified teachers i graduated high school in  this could have changed since i was in school im sure there are fine private schools out there but in the town im from the catholic and christian schools were dumping grounds for the kids expelled from public school yea it is typical of a lot of private schools i attend this school mainly to play football because our team makes it to the state championship regularly and because they offer an early admission program where i can take college courses while still in high school  sadly as a floridian who went to private catholic school i was the one who taught my publicschooled friends about evolution and cosmology  on the other hand one of my friends went to a fundamentalist school three miles down the road where they taught that stars are nothing but the twinkle in gods eye and that the un is plotting a takeover of the united states  its crazy out there i dont think there are any actual laws against it but itd still be a pr nightmare for the teacher and her boss so since most of the class seems to not object shell keep going  if youre in high school there is a good chance youre right  yeah man youre a unique snowflake and theyre all just sheeple they are dipshits though  welcome to the american education system  were trained to be idiots from an early age our country ftfy  out of  conservative republicans believe obama is muslimone out of threetell me again how its just a fringe element that the liberal media is playing up my republican friends deleted im sure weve got one around here somewheremaybe in the junk drawer bbca the gop is the fringe now can you be surprised that at least  of this country are idiots hell  are voting for romney even when most are a part of the  i was offered proof of it he said the call to prayer was beautiful and he didnt wear a lapel pin with a flag on it yup proof  holy shitive been such a fool a blind fool to be fair even madonna called him a muslim oy vey madonna also lip synchs her performances so tell me what ja rule thinks of the attacks on september th its not like madonna is even human anyways flotus has better arms surprised they didnt start chanting usa wait a minute i originally came from duval county which is right next to clay county and my education this was high school though was rich and void of ignorance granted i went to one of the best high schools in the country but the studies were very politically correct i did see a few super religious nuts studentsbut it was not a majority who is teaching this crazy crap colleges  i assume when you say that you went to one of the best high schools in the nation youre referring to either stanton or paxon right i went to paxon for one year anyways small world  yeah went to stanton  gt who is teaching this crazy crap sandalwood terry parker etc etc i went to ctk and bk  in th or th grade i mentioned something about evolution to my neighborhood friends who went to public schools  one stops and stares me down  youre going to hell for thatapparently most public schools in duval wont touch evolution with a  year old stick but the baptist sunday schools have no problem teaching their side of the storymy gf was teaching in the duval public schools for a while and every other day she had some complaint about teachers giving religiously biased lessons or praising jesus etcimportant to remember that not every school is a paxon or a stanton well  of my brothers went to sandalwood but it was some time ago i know there are areas that are bad off but i thought it had improved and the religious nuts were fading away   lemme guess orange park  im so sorry   why when i hear about something fucking stupid a teacher did its always a female teacher im sure the breath this person would warn you that scary black christian church went to with reverend wright consistency is not a big concern for these rednecks   hell take away your medicare and turn the country into a socialist state i love the contradiction there its really telling that this is actually what they believe  socialistic nope when you are quoting the mental giants in the tea party it is important to be accurate socialist state is how they state it now if they were to write it it would look like this sooshalust stat gotta love that th grade home schooled education  i was just going from the op the lady said socialistic twice in the recording  probably couldnt spell it if she tried though lol was just joking with ya man i cannot wait til the teapublicans go the way of disco and we do not have to draw such a fine line between a joke and what they actually say p  i think its going to get a lot worse before its better  like theyre going to drop down to clan of the cave bear levels before they yoyo back up hey no reason to drag rednecks into this  i believe you mean republicans wait red necks republican color is redmon dieu hey wait a minutethats not american get him boys no need hes already surrendered  interestingly enough im a graphic artist so i studied a lot of propaganda i spotted this chestnutnote the use of color very subtle goebbels would be proud for lack of any simpler subliminal statement this literally says romney will put the white back in red white and blue holy shit  yeah rednecks are a nice group of people they just get misunderstood a lot because college student just keep committing suicide on their property and it looks like murders haha funny looking movie  theyd be the ultimate martyrs its hilarious but its alan tudyk so      its still hilarious hey college kids we got yer friend ill gladly support a redneck liberal just like obama im half and half the greatest woman i ever knew grew up in north carolina my grandmother who was irishgerman descentive hung out with redneck truckers and they were kind of cool even if they were republicans they just throw a bunch of crazy out there and just one has to stick per person most of them dont get outside and are also unemployed rednecks would imply they have a job working on a farm somewhere pastyfatnecks would be more accurate i have literally had an argument with someone who said the president was a muslim and he was a racist because he went to the church of rev wright ive never understood this talking point  wrights church is clearly the stronger point given that its actually based in reality yet they keep pushing the muslim angle yeah the muslim angle is so frustrating because its not true and even worse it implies that being muslim is a bad thing  thats the shufflestep isnt true  doesnt matter the thing is if you reply with isnt true it twists into youre accepting it does matter and if you reply with doesnt matter it shifts into i guess youre saying its true the calculus of stupid how you manipulate people who cant keep more than one thought in their head at the same time wow i had never even realized that ugly side of the tactici guess you just have to say muthen having any religion is a bad thing  my point is being muslim doesnt make you a bad person no being weak minded enough to follow a book when it says to kill makes you a bad person  you seem nice gnometard king of persuasion deleted as an atheist people like you give us a bad name no one gives a fuck that youre atheist they give a fuck that youre a nice person  but hes an atheist so he cant be a nice person eating babies and all that republicans are not based in reality therefore i dont think they really believe hes a muslim they just think theyre clever enough that they can get other people to believe he is but it would be much more clever to use actual facts instead of illogical madness would it not i wouldnt call radical black theology a christian ideology by any measure of the term its filled with a bunch of racist scum  probably why obama went there for  years he hates white christians  youre saying you wouldnt associate them with christianity even though that is the religion forced upon them by slave owners interesting deleted african americans were raised with your stupid ass dogma because it was taught to their ancestors by your backward ancestors that were too lazy to do field work for themselves take your insults and your winky face and shove them up your ass  hey he is sort controversial deleted i sir am not a fucking sir and while i appreciate how hard youre trying to troll here you should understand how badly youre failing none of your arguments here are in any way mutually exclusive to mine youre simply trying to create diversions because you cant even use logic in your trolling im sure jesus will forgive you for calling my mother an inbred whore i hope you get the shit kicked out of you before then so you learn that sometimes things do have consequences then again im sure youre quiet as a mouse around people you see in person so they dont learn what an inconsiderate little twit you are lifes fun when you can be a dick on the internet with no repercussions isnt it deleted yup he hates them so much that they have persecuted endlessly since he came into office oh wait  deleted because speak english retard lol is totally a grammatically correct sentence how exactly has obama demonstrated this hatred that you speak of irishmanerrant actually wrote nearly perfect english he had exactly one grammatical error putting a comma after an ellipsis with an otherwise logical and mildly humorous comment you however dont speak english clearly i count three grammar mistakes the only thing you have going for you is spelling deleted well it did look perfect to me until you pointed out that he accidentally a word my brain totally skipped over that and filled in the missing been whoops your smiley face implies a happy exterior yet your radical ignorance and racism projects exactly that ignorant racism good luck in life  i know i heard hes gonna make flava flav undersecretary of enslaving white people the funny thing is matter wasits were living mccarthy era two replacing communist with muslim its sickening and this coming atheist youre absolutely right what powell said was great and really needed to be said i think he should go on tv and say it again because people have forgotten check out the comments of that stompingrabits he even contradicts himself deleted oh itll get cranked to  but i do look forward to all the explaining they try and do especially if they lose congressdems still suck for not making congress a lock this season it is curiously notable that this years republican ticket is the first time in history where there is a major party ticket with no protestants on it and yet evangelicalsmany of whom believe that both mormons and catholics are not christiansare a significant part of their political base other than the fact that being a communist would actually be politically relevant  except freedom of religion is a little closer to what being an american is all about have you no sense of decency sir at long last have you left no sense of decency and hes atheist and fascist and handful things you the timeedit muslim atheist socialist fascist or as gingrich once saidgti am convinced that if we do not decisively win the struggle over the nature of america by the time theyre my age they will be in a secular atheist country potentially one dominated by radical islamists and with no understanding of what it once meant to be an american that would be the relevant quote yes this explains why he wanted to colonize the moon deleted yes lunatic excellent choice of words  i hope we fund this project so we can send newt and anyone like him there  the last thing we need is those assholes at the top of our gravity well cause if there are two groups that get along and could make a functioning government its secular atheists and radical islamists peace and chicken man peace and chicken and gringrich was the smartest perhaps too immorally smart of all the candidate choices  how far the gop has fallen newt gingrich is a stupid persons idea of what a smart person looks like  alan grayson ha ha good joke oh my god thats hilarious do you have any source on it id like to see it i dont understand how we could ever turn out to be a secular atheist country run by radical islamists how are people so terrified of that happening stupid everyone knows that the country will be run by atheists and antitheists by that time i think that of perhaps all of the gop nomination hopefuls gingrich had rhetoric that would most cornsistently make me angry that someone could be so ignorant and that this man actually believed the things he was saying he wants to take away medicare and turn america into a socialistic countryall of my wat you do realize that medicare is a socialist program right you cant be for one and against the other yes i know logic doesnt work but still jackiechanwtfjpg hes a communist socialist muslim from africa that wants to destroy americano mom hes just a democrat  you forgot fascist nazi  hes a communist socialist fascist nazi muslim atheist damn dude thats like all the bad things in one tomaytotomahto tomato tomato my brother just dropped my new favorite combination on me last night hes a big government marxist  im going to bet your brother isnt terribly familiar with marx except as a coldwar era boogieman my sister told wouldnt vote obama xtian no worries that the book mormon completely changes key fundamentals the xtian mythology voting based souly on religion is the stupidest thing about anything  i dont care that he has been great for the nation no god no vote im gonna vote for a god fearing warmonger instead  souly  i see what im assuming you did on purpose there i feel as you do and i have to watch myself because i have to stop myself from putting too much weight in his rational stance on religion obamas while i think this is a huge thing i want to actively prevent myself from making decisions on things he wont ultimately be able to affect or liking him simply because he panders to a view i hold dear ie how would i be different from someone supporting romney who wants a religious leader were i to support obama on his rational stance on the same matter you have it backwards  its not obama has a rational stance on religion therefor i support him in the hopes that hell somehow make america more secular  its obama has a rational stance on religion therefor hes far less likely to try to enact religious morality as public policy well yeah thats exactly how i rationalize it  hmm  its almost as if the tendency of religion to turn off peoples reasoning causes horrible effects on our civil society and culture not the least of which being the belief that after the  apostles died all authority to lead the church was lost and all other christian churches are wrong as if an unbroken chain of authority stretching over  years to the current pope is more plausible a chain which involved a pig at one point during a dispute  no st peter was really a rabbit  upon this cottontail i shall build my church i have never heard of this  please enlighten me i agree to an extent but at least with something  years old we dont have enough concrete evidence to say definitively one way or another  with mr smith we know he made it all up if you believe in god joseph smiths story is just as plausible as the rest of the claims of christianity at that level yes but we do have actual evidence of his fraud   the scroll he translated was found and it turned out to simply be egyptian burial procedures  xtian is that really a thing it is   assumed to be derived from xmas   the x abbr was originally used by the catholic church prior to the th century oh source its as good as any   my source was being raised catholic huh when i was in th grade i wrote xmas for pretty much everything and a teacher yelled at me because it was disrespectful to the christian religion id never thought about it since i love having my knowledge appended thanks gtxtiangtmythologyholy shit son your bravery level is off the fucking charts still the best response you can come up with after all these years  people why countries think were retarded other countries here pretty much  yup  i confirm all three previous responses confirmed  alaaho akbar britain calling in thanks for the big mac but some of you really take the piss incidentally why other states think the south is all retarded too southerner here a lot of us are upset at our home states too dont worry well if it makes you feel better we voted down gay marriage too im sure its a soothing balm to know that ignorance and bigotry are shared  all countries have people like the woman described in this posthaters gonna hate and all thatwhat makes america look a little silly is that idiots like this are not only tolerated but even supported by a sizeable portion of the mainstream media and political bodies which leads to public acceptance after long enoughasimov said it perfectlythere is a cult of ignorance in the united states and there has always been the strain of antiintellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge i had a long converstaion with my friends about this last night every country has its fair share of morons and idiots the main difference between the us and most other countries is that in those other countries the idiots and morons are ashamed of being idiots and morons while in the us they are not only proud of it they are being celebrated for it just take climate change and evolution denieres these idiots are heroes to large parts of the populations while they are being laughed at in most other countries feels good to look at countries like sudan and malaysia though at least were not that bad  at least were not as bad as those countries that only sometimes have functioning governments little to no education system and ongoing wars it is not that we dont have crazy people here but the crazy people tend not to make it as far into power crazy is simply not as tolerated we dont think youre all retarded maybe  but not all gee thanks hell rid your medicareif way wed socialistic countryread those times the effect bash your head wall repeatedly keep your government hands off my medicare he ripped the football charlie brown america we want years aaugh lives barack obama goes to target and rips tags off of pillows in his spare timei know its true because i saw it on foxnationcom obama once killed a puppy with his bare feet that was me sorry them ate it he also leaves expired coupons on shelves in grocery stores good grief obama raped and murdered a woman in  they say  glenn beck obama raped and murdered glenn beck in  and wears his skin to pretend to be him  a woman glen beck punches kittens in the face kittens are terrorists that hate war veterans and everyones fathers so the mainstream media says but in reality its the puppies that are the real terrorists crapping on lawns pissing on the carpet chewing on my shoes this meme was unfunny from day one so obama is also a little white girl named lucy my grandparents live clay county pretty mild discussion politics grand mother blurted that i wasnt alive when hitler was power proceeded to tell the thing happening with obama she then told was muslim that i scared i was floored they very republican whole life shit crazy its truly scary what is going on here facts mean nothing in fact the irony of bringing up hitler and his propaganda techniques fox is basically going by the goebles playbook no see since they bringup hitler first they cant be the ones using nazi tactics i felt the same way the first time i talked to a birther it was actually kind of nice knowing that i was better than someone in every imaginable way sad thing is that someone will probably end up assassinating him and then theyll go to their graves convinced he would have been hitler if not she watches fox thats all its not a character defect its just ordinary misinformation be patient with her its not her faulti wish there was some penalty for misleading the public but i guess the first amendment means anything goes there lots this bs going the scenes why earth would religion matter why people care much because some people need a book to learn how to live their lives and theyre not even following the book correctly i tried to read some other books but i soon gave up on thatthe paragraphs aint numbered and they complicate the factsi cant read harry potter cos theyre worshipping false gods and thatand dumbledores a poofter and thats bad cos its not goodmorality is written there in simple white and blacki feel sorry for you heathens got to think about all thatgood is good and evils bad and goats are good and pigs are crapyoull find which one is which in the good book cos its goodand its a book and its a book dr seuss has that effect or read it for that matter because some people cling to their guns and their religion who brought up guns cuz merica its a bit from a speech or town hall meeting where obama was talking about the people of pennsyltucky you know the sudden redneck wasteland between philly and pittsburgh ironically no one is after their guns in fact id trade them guns for their bibles wed be a lot safer in a world with more people who make decisions based on facts and reality rather than beliefswithoutevidence iono why you got downvoted youre right obama hasnt pushed any big scary gun control stuff in the past  yearsthere was a selfinflicted ammo shortage for a while afaik caused bywait for itpanic buying by gun enthusiasts fearful of new government regulations  a lot of conservative commentators somehow claimed the government was secretly behind the shortage and the ensuing price increases  because people care about being narrow minded bigots  never mind the fact that brewery installed the white house muslims drink and you can pretty much see he is not responding to the call to prayer every day which ispretty damn important if youre a muslim his wife has a

the point changing the this poll it effect the poll presently useful demonstration stupid people are we have to change the result of the poll or else itll create a hole in the fabric of space and time you need to divide by zero to restore balance to the universe its a trap get an axe  to  not a muslim still too close  osamas not a muslimwho knew i voted five times didnt change a percentage point its a yelling contest really idve thought reddit could yell pretty damn loud cant you reddit  yeah sorry reddit i know you hate being referred to in the singular well do it live i have a man on their boat were gonna need a bigger boat i can has cheezburger good thing my head has built in paradox absorbing crumple zones vin diesel can divide by zero deleted i added a yes vote    yeah people are idiots his middle name is hussein for god sakes of corse hes muslim  i dont like the hussein thing  ive had enough of hussein paula abdul is a terrorist too and his mother was an atheist do you want a godless heathen who is also a radical muslim terrorist in office dont forget he also goes to a crazy christian church hes also elitist  and hes black also not black enough i thought strange percentages were a part of american political tradition no silly thats just dead people votes paid for votes lost votes found votes and multiple registration votes all perfectly normal here in the good ol usofa can we please be overtaken by china soon i agree  everyone knows obama is  muslim  not muslim and  undecided  idiots youd think theyll get its a rumor especially when its under urban legends ahrnold says its not a rumah actually it is somewhat important if people are unsure see the results after the poll they are going to be influenced its just how the mind worksit seems very odd to me that some random aboutcom article basically dedicated to saying obama isnt a muslim has  votes vs  saying he is possibly its being forwarded in a a chain email itself or is being flash mob polled or just rigged like it is by reddit now anyway although there are  undecided although if you where to rig a pole having all your voted on the one option would look obvious the thing isnt set to block your ip so feel free to clickthru and vote  billion times  clearly bill oreilly is already doing it i put in my  cents i log in just to support this statement with a written a statement samecuring stupidity is easy lock them in a room with lightarms and let darwin sort it out gtcuring stupidity is easy lock them in a room with lightarms and let darwin sort it outexcept that below a certain threshold one may be too stupid to figure out how to use a firearm oh damn they dont tend to manage to reproduce either a firearm doesnt need to be loaded and discharged to be used  anything can be used as a club aka pistol whipping curing stupidity is very easy just remove all warning labels and it will sort itself out lather rinse repeat guys at work all think hes muslim  they all have gun collections  they dont hunt  they just like having lots of guns  you know in case of revolution what are they in a facebook group that txt messages them in case one starts maybe  i asked them what they use all the guns for  they said theyre prepared its comforting in a way i suppose to be ready for things life can throw at you i worry about some of the same things as those guys i wager mall ninjas are a common occurrence though tbhto them im the crazy nutball i didnt go the  guns and k rounds of ammo route i went the build a nice little hobby farm that is fun rewarding and more sustainable route it is a lot more work than gazing over at some fancy fnfals and dreaming of the fun i could have if civilization would hurry up and collapse and i get my chance to measure up and be one of the smart guys ltsarcasmgtplus the dragons tongue beans are tastier than the ones at the storedont get me wrong i shot a  pound hog  weeks ago everyone can get a good laugh over the mall ninjas though that reminds me here have a laugh awesome link  you cant make that kind of shit up  i am sure that there is a technical psychological term for that guys specific disorder but since i dont know what it is im comfortable with just plain old fucknut crazy   thats not a fair generalization i own a bunch of guns dont hunt and am waiting for the revolution and still prefer to see a president obama to a president mccain well arent you something do they have bikes in case of revolution harley davidsons well better than a car but i think a bicycle would survive a revolution much easier you should tell them if they really want to prepare for a revolution they should be diy or die and then scream up the punx worst comes to worst and you make some neat punker friends and confuse your coworkers then again harley driving gun toting people for the most part are easily confused nice generalizations and did you calmly explain that he isnt anyone that thinks hes muslim is immune to explanations id hope not or a win isnt as likely as many people would like to think  at first i was picturing arms as beams of light  i didnt understand until i read the comments below another

bet its just poll spamming check the date on that old piece  peoples stupidity is one of the few things that can always be taken for granted mob mentality can work in mysterious ways sometimes judging by the audience that rush limbaugh and hannity gets that pretty much accounts for the hopelessly lost percentagelive with it you forgot oriely ding ding ding its something reddit needs to realise poll invasions only serve to invalidate the poll theyre supposed to be representative of the general public not a small subset gt theyre supposed to be representative of thegt general public not a small subsetno there are different types of polls online polls like this one are supposed to be representative of the people visting the website and bothering to participate you cannot do an online poll on some random website and then claim that it should represente the opinions of the general public i believe that online polls are only valid if you accept this factif you actually believe that this poll is supposed to be a representative of the general public its already invalid with or without the invasion by redditors just because they arent doesnt mean theyre not supposed to be yes an online poll will only measure the visitors on a certain day who can be bothered to click the poll but most polls on reddit are not some random website they are on big sites with a wide target audience and whilst youll still get some skewing youd expect a reasonably representative responseaboutcom msnbc bbc would all expect large numbers from a wide range of people and usually would be expected to get semi credible figures however the second the polls become advertsied on somewhere like reddit encouraging a certain response and appealing to a very narrow group of people itll skew the poll beyond acceptable levels and make them worthlessonline polls have a level of inaccuracy theyll never compare to carefully carried out random stratified sampling but they are more representative than you seem to think gt just because they arent doesnt mean theyre not supposed to beno serious organization assume their online polls represents the opinions of the general publics i dont consider fox news to be serious assuming that your online polls are a good representation of the general public is as stupid as knocking on random doors at  a thursday afternoon and ask the people about tax breaks for workers by lowering support standards for aged people or something similar you wont get a representative resultgt youd expect a reasonably representative responseno you dont not unless you dont know what youre talking aboutyoure referring msnbc heres what msnbc says about their online pollsgt gt live votes are not intended to be a scientific sample of opinion instead they are part of the same dialogue that takes place in our online chat sessions a way to share your views on the news with your fellow users and with msnbccom writers and editorsas for bbc their own guidelines tells them that they should normally not report the results of online polls in radio or tv or in news not directly related to their web sites thats how seriously bbc takes their own online polls sstupidfreaking completely paranoidg uh no they really are stupid not paranoid stupid no they are stupid for believing obama is muslim without any evidence in that direction and they are paranoid for thinking a muslim president in a predominantly christian nation would be the end of the world deleted it must be sad to be an ignorant piss ant wheres the why the fuck matter what religion follows option because if the invisible guy the president believes in isnt the real invisible guy then the real invisible guy gets mad and no longer powers our economy with his invisible handjesus have you never even read anything about economics gtjesus have you never even read anything about economicsyour typical carpenter from the time that the romans were running around probably was undoubtedly pretty ignorant regarding economics  given that he was also probably illiterate its pretty unlikely that he ever read any economics works the carpenter is a lie but the cake is delicious citizens of rome considered politics extremely important and most male landowning citizens were quite versed in politics the same cannot be said for recent times jesus isnt your typical carpenter  reals yo  homey made a mug dat saved sean connerys doubleohfuckin life  respek yeh well he had to be illiterate and stupid to become a carpenter out in the desert considering theres not alot of lumber in that part of the worldbut then his choice of occupation matters little when he really didnt even exist any more than the lilliputians do now its a desert once upon a pretty time before all the wars it was a veritable paradise sadly theres a rather large minority of america that believe that religion makes a huge difference it does look at your governments funding decisions on stem cell research and on foreign aid for hiv prevention i dont think the religion of the president matters as long as he does a good job  but if someone really went to a concerted effort to conceal their true religion to the point of attending a christian church for  years it would be a problem  not because their religion matters but because that would be an intense level of deceptionluckily its all complete hooey in this case because its important to understand how it informs his beliefs  i think it would be important if he was part of john hagees church or a militant jihadist mosque  obviously theres nothing intrinsically bad with any religion but understanding the nuance of their faith is important  btw nonbeliever here im wondering why anyone supports him if he follows any religion  ive posted this before and people sidestep it because they are in love with obama the man is a christian  but arent most of his supporters on here atheists  isnt this man delusional to believe that a savior was born from god without an earthly father  made blind men see raised the dead healed the sick etc  that the bible is gods word  that homosexuality is a sin  if obama is a christian then this is what he believes  and according to most here christians are certifiable morons weak people who cant live their lives without something to believe in  we cant have it both ways  either this man doesnt deserve to lead so much as a boy scouts troop or there is something very real about christianity that must be ok  im really not trolling here but this really bothers me about people  is it ok to defend a man who earnestly believes in fairy tales  is he really representative of you gt  the man is a christian but arent most of his supporters on here atheists isnt this man delusional to believe that a savior was born from god without an earthly father made blind men see raised the dead healed the sick etc that the bible is gods word that homosexuality is a sin if obama is a christian then this is what he believesnot necessarily just because you say he believes that doesnt make it so and many christians dont because i went to a public school for the americans amongst you its like the  date thing  here in the uk a public school is the more exclusive kind of private school we had a large chapel and two attendant church of england vicars on site all re lessons were taken by them perhaps this is unusual in religious education classes i dont know but these vicars did at least give a lesson or so to hinduism buddhism and the like but these two old boys were quite specific that the bible is metaphorical that its a set of set of rules and analogies to guide you though life  and that a modern anglican may revere jesus essentially because he was a good person rather than any magical holiness about him we are after all children of god in this metaphor which to my mind works just as well if you replace god with nature he represents what i beleive in more than any other of the candidates even if he is a christian and im nonreligous who would you suggest is more representative of us is there a presidential candidate that is an avowed atheist gtthe man is a christianat least thats what he says along with the vast majority of us politicians its a sad fact that theres only iirc  openly atheist senator when statistically for their backgrounds we should expect to see atheists making up about half of the senate ive read alot of things on obama and yes im a supporter but i never read anything about him believing everything said in the building he attends on sundays is that in his book that came out i dont see christians the same way a lot of people have doubts about the fairy tale but are afraid to admit it if people had  doubts about it then they probably would never go against the bible i dont go to church but i do believe it teaches good values and perhaps obama is there for the overall values you are right but the obama supporters on reddit will make a million excuses why you are wrong they are drinking his cool aid    i dont believe that obama is muslim but let me ask you why would a country whos majority is christian want a muslim leader  since the religion matters to them in the first place its very understandable that they would not want a muslim president this country may have a christian majority but it isnt supposed to be a christian country big difference people should vote for the best candidate regardless of what imaginary friends they havedont have why would you vote for any man delusional enough to believe in fairy tales  is schizophrenia something we should ignore when looking at a candidate should vote sure but if you have an imaginary friend it probably seems perfectly logical to vote based on which clique of imaginary friends the candidate sides withi should add that i dont particularly like the use of with phrase imaginary friend to reference god as it seems patronising to those who choose to use a personification metaphor to express their spirituality but just makin the point i think patronisation is the whole idea here gt big difference people should vote for the best candidate regardless of what imaginary friends they havedont haveif they arent allowed to choose the criteria for best themselves what good is democracy anyway it isnt any good its just stable gtwhy would a country whos majority is christian want a muslim leaderthats the problem as far as im concerned as a nonreligious person i dont understand why they insist our leader must follow the same religion as them i do understand that theyre more likely to prefer a person of their religion because they may have more in common as far as political stands go but if the choice is between a muslim who would make a great president who even matches them in the majority of their political views and a christian who happens to be a warmongering maniac who will probably end up nuking half the planet they will vote for the lunatic because hes christian i simply cant understand that unless theyre the nutty kind of religious folks who long for the end of days or whatever this country is not as christian as the media and the fundamentalists would have you believe gti dont believe that obama is muslim but let me ask you why would a country whos majority is christian want a muslim leaderyour belief is inconsequential the facts are what countsindia is a predominantly hindu country and we have had like  sikh prime ministers and a christian oneseriously is usa india  now theres a country to copy off of sarcasm seriously are you seriousatleast indias religious nutjobs have a track record of not caring if their leader is part of their faithsome of the worst religious nutjobs in the world are here in the usa define worst  how is one religious nut job worse than another the worst is the nutjobs who actually have power to influence politics at a massive scale a stealth muslim muslim their holy text pretty strict thatedit some interpretations eg sunni vary not applicable areas see muslim cleric details dude no shit  muslims when confronted about their faith are supposed to declare to the rooftops what they are  otherwise they arent muslims unless claiming to be muslim would put you in danger in which case it is acceptable to lie and claim that you are something elseassuming of course you do all the proper rituals and penance once you are out of danger deleted ya rly in islam there are certain situations in which you are allowed to say you arent muslim like when someone is going to kill you or do something bad to you or others also i think the first  or  years not positive of the length after the prophet muhammads revelation he only revealed the message of islam to his closest friends and basically kept it a secret until he had a big enough group to spread it except for the muslims that dont know theyre muslims until they start singing all along the watchtower said the joker to the thief this is actually a difference between sunnis and shiitessunni muslims believe that if you hide your religion you are more afraid of man than of allah and hence this is forbiddenshias are allowed to hide their muslim faith if under duress  this is called taqiyya im being oppressed  im being denied my right to sweeping generalizations about muslimsedit ltsnarkgt that would fall under freedom of speech so yeah you should have that right absolutely  of course others then have the right to decry you as an islamaphobe or whatever what about his right to be correct about sweeping generalizations about muslims see comment i am not  positive but i think it applies to any muslim i cannot a muslim either perhaps i am a stealth muslim but then i wouldnt be a muslimim so confused right now i thought i read the opposite somewhere but only when they were in foreign nonmuslim territory  does anyone have a source pointing one way or the other a practicing muslim is allowed to hide his faith to protect his life i believe if in a foreign hostile land  and christians and jews are supposed to be free to worship as they like in muslim lands im a muslim and thats exactly correct thanks for confirmation  good to know i learned something in college  so that means antidenses comment is wrong right  why did it get upvoted so much well every interpretation of their strict text is the right one eg shiites sunni so i guess im right in a wrong way p  see millstones comment in this thread well its not completely wrong but it just needs that little exception to be correct other than in lifethreatening situations muslims arent supposed to pretend to be something else yep im pretty sure its a scientific fact that if they dont they spontaneously combust ive read that on the intertoobs so i t must be true qed   barack obama has far too high of a reflectivity to be a stealth muslim  youd need to paint his ass with carbonyl iron ferrite and give him bat wings before id believe itdoes the koran really outlaw doing that to people the koran says you can do whatever you want in a war with nonmuslims  here you go read up on your little holy book hes stealth muslim dubya stealth mensa member undecided what kind response that it opinionthat reminded that horrible west virginia video paraphrasing i vote obama hes american hes muslim then the videographer actually hes christian the response well i agree with thatits fucking opinion its fact it undecided unknown this perpetuating the stupidityedit thanks natty  i noticed was opinion question blame the original poster  the question isnt is obama a muslim its do you believe barack obama could really be a stealth muslim its ostensibly a hypothetical question hence it makes sense to add an i cant decide answer gtits not a fucking opinion its a factnot necessarily according to some muslims for example under islamic law the son of a muslim is by default a muslim and a laws been proposed in iran that would mandate execution for apostasy including apostasy for children of muslimsof course i dont think hes a muslim it seems though some of the more lunatic muslims might think otherwise think how badly that will mess with the middle eastern muslims minds when they figure out obama is an apostate yet he is also interested in withdrawing from iraq  i really wonder how theyll deal with the dissonance  theyll probably just believe hes still a muslim because were all stupid like that thanks ignorance racism obamas real opponents john mccain hillary clinton ahemto southern christians its that hes muslim its that all black people areyou christian you arent white this prejudice them they people who acts them good christians isntobamas minister was the prototypical muslim to them wearing funny clothes africa angry they shit the koran completely evil the middleeast africa muslims darkerthey live people who exactly them small towns im indian when i walk there its martian walks the fucking door they to speak slowly to english till start talking i live in the south and i consider myself a christian and i agree  with this post most of the people here are completely ignorant and to be honest cant be trusted operating a voting machine i know a person that i consider a friend who honestly thinks barack obama is a muslim extremist and is in some kind of elaborate plot with osama bin laden to take over the us and he never really says what would happen after that he just leaves me in my stupefied state not knowing whether to punch him in the face or to punch myself in the face for even associating with these kind of idiots you want to correct poll what good will that dowouldnt that mask the problem people thinking obama muslim the poll is worthless anyhow nobody has noticed its under the urban legends section of this site  fuck you frank

fact that people elected frightening undoubtedly one of the stupidest persons in congress when i worked on the hill we would rate floor speeches like olympic judges based on how batshit they were gohmert is like the michael phelps of guano he makes jim traficant look like an elder statesman i have no idea how his staff can stand to work for him i go to school with one of his former interns they are just as batshit crazy and these are rich powerful white folks not just random crazy folk  why would rich white people not be bat shit crazy theyre eccentric crazy is for poor people theyre determined  zealotry is for brown people no real reason but being bat shit crazy might hinder one from getting or staying rich  cause according to many of them those are minority problems  to be fair to jim traficant people tuned into cspan to listen to him rant and rave in his peculiar hair and bad suit  gohmert is far less entertaining he might have a phd but to me hes a phul foollouis gohmertwe listen to his hourly sermon on the floor every friday its a treasure trove of comedy upvote for michael phelps of guano michelle bachmann is the mark spitz of political insanity isnt she shes really not even close a lot of the crazy shit that comes out of her mouth is an act shes saying what she thinks people in her base want to hear in person her crazy eyes look comes across more like a deer in the headlights shes also really really fucking hot i dont know whos hitting that but it aint her husband she is  years old and while may have been hot as a younger woman her age is taking the shine off she is also batshit crazy with a whole lot of stupid mixed in i find it interesting that it was back in the s that the swine flu broke out under another then under another democrat president jimmy carter im not blaming this on president obama i just think its an interesting coincidence rep michele bachmann carbon dioxide is portrayed as harmful but there isnt even one study that can be produced that shows that carbon dioxide is a harmful gas rep michelle bachmann if we took away the minimum wage  if conceivably it was gone  we could potentially virtually wipe out unemployment completely because we would be able to offer jobs at whatever level michele bachmann  yeah we have a stellar intellect here folks  im not saying shes smart but i am saying shes cynical gotcha she is definitely that that third bullet point is stellar if you could say one thing about african slaves its that they were employedby that i mean the logical conclusion of offer jobs at whatever level is slavery because at least youre working the minimum wage statement is not stupid or irrational i think you might want to think your statement all the way through she is all but saying that we should go back to dickensian era england and the only thing she left out was repealing child labor laws rep steve king according to rumors i do not find that difficult to believe in the slightest eh i think shes in the ann coulter category somewhat  ann coulter is truly a conservative but shes smart and i think she says all of her bullshit just to rile people up and get attention  i think that if i were to meet her in person shed be th the crazy she is on tvi say somewhat because i think bachmann is truly a conservative but is an idiot and believes probably  of what she says when i work for incompetent people i normally just convince myself to view it as a stepping stone im not an american but it seems like every day or so theres a new stupidest person in your congress or elected official seems like the bar is set pretty low to become a servant of the people the house of representatives is based on regional representation with  members the regions are fairly small and we have some very dumb regions the regions are also very rigged as well to be elected in one way or another this is what marylands third congressional district looks like looks like its right at the corner of gerry and mander oh holy shit haha thats just something else nothing says we care about ours jobs more than the people we represent better than good ol fashion gerrymandering  yep all you have to do is get elected what are the criteria for lawmakers in your country money representatives in congress as opposed to senators who must win an entire state get elected by sometimes incredibly small and incredibly homogenized ideological voting bases  depending on how you draw out their electoral map in whatever swatch of whatever part of the state they represent you can make it so that the people that they have to win over are to a person all insanely rightwing  you still get crazy rightwing senators and we have them its just a tad bit harder and less likely  and so the political logic goes that you can be as crazy as you want to be with no political repercussions if you happen to represent a district thats in rural alabamamississippitexas etc  in fact youre actually rewarded electorally because the only people that challenge you with any hope of winning in a primary have to play race to the right as hard and as fast as they possibly can i dont understand why there isnt an aptitude test for lawmakers most professionals that affect a lot of lives have to prove their competence every now and again their released scores can help the public determine whos a more competent candidate we only really judge them on how smooth of a talker they are there should be some objectivity in deciding not just who youd have a beer with only issue i see is that congress never wants to make it harder for themselves and it could become easily politicized especially since academia is a political weapon to certain idealogues people have a right to choose their government that means that they have the right to vote for people that others would consider to be unqualified true and having an aptitude test is only more information people can still be antiintellectual the reason these idiots manage to get into congress is due to the failure of our mass media  the media has been coopted by government so thoroughly that this shit gets a passthe media should be asking gohmert about these idiotic statements at every opportunity  for examplereporter  representative gohmert who are the people you are referring to when you say there are so many muslim brotherhood members in the current administration  since there so many of them you must surely know who they are to make that assessment i think the american people would like to know who these people are that would imply some kind of accountability being batshit crazy has no effect on credibility anymore in fact saying insane shit really only serves to up your profile and garner additional funding from our monied overlords who want everybody thinking crazy is normal  the war criminal allen westhe violated the ucmj but officers retire and pay fines from florida was actually called on his mccarthyite claim of there being cardcarrying marxist in congressgtat a town hall meeting with constituents in jensen beach west was asked how many members of congress are cardcarrying marxistsgtaccording to cnn affiliate wpec west responded i believe theres about  to  members of the democratic party that are members of the communist partygtwests campaign manager tim edison pointed reporters to wests next comments when he says the members in question belong to the congressional progressive caucuscnn storyhe lost his reelection bid it was depressing by how narrowly he lost it to  lets hope he never gets into politics again they have to agree to be interviewed and i am sure they are tired of pointy headed smart people asking them to explain what they said and making them feel dumb there are also state and local congresses that dont influence policy but are full of small town idiots it can be difficult to tell which ones are actual bad politicians and which are fake bad politicians savant of the people i dont think that word means what you think it does i realised after that it meant he would be exceptionally good at somethingnot likely it would be different if they were more comical than embarrassing the bar is not set low dont be ignorant you cant just waltz out of a truck stop porn shop and become a congressman i think americans have the healthy tendency of bringing to light the shortcomings of our elected officials which is why you see a new this every week  showing a this is only half the fight though its meaningless unless it comes with censure and or replacement as much as it pains me to say but i guess bachmann is really smarter than someone else when louis gohmert opens his mouth the only question is how stupid will he be but if cosmology tells us one thing it is symetryso if there is intelligence on a scale from smart to stupid  there has to be antiintelligence toomaybe we have found this now it is hypothized that listening to antiintelligence is not measured in how stupid will he be  but in how much stupider the audience gets after listening no there are far dumber folks like hank guam might capsize johnson and sheila jackson is the flag neil armstrong planted on mars still there lee true gems there dont forget about shelia lee jackson  how  its an undisputed fact that there is an islamist influence in the obama whitehorse  just look at the facts study it out love it   no the white horse belonged to romney but failed to deliver the election to him please educate me with names and addresses ago i can join the knowledgeable racist sexist homophobic gunpacking churchgoing old senile white trash voters and on the other hand you have antichristian over medicated indoctrinated pseudo intellectual young kids who think that they know everything about politics and government because they made a b in their freshman civics coursewhere are the fucking normal people gtantichristiani dont think you know what that means go visit ratheism and find out what it means you can be atheist with a particular grudge against christians duh theres nothing abnormal about being antichristian i guess my point was that many young wana be atheist are not really atheist they are only antichristian touched a nerve there youre a christian and youre accusing them of being indoctrinated did parent say he was christian or is this a conclusion you jumped to ha you say antichristian like its supposed to be a bad thing to be honest hes mostly there so that the oil companies can get nice tax breaks and favorable regulationthat being said the last person to run against his was dr shirley mckellar a former major in the army nursing corps with an rn and a doctorate in nursing management  i would say that she would be a much better choice and did vote for her but this is deep east texas  it didnt seem like she had all that much support and her website wasnt all that great either nowhere as nice as ghomerts she got  of the vote in  the fact that people like him arent actually charged with treason is depressing what has he done that was treasonousedit downvotes with no response  circlejerk commence the whole political system in america is frightening  its idiots like him that believe obama is the antichrist although he is exaggerating one cant ignore some of the people obama has appointed such as dalia mogahed im all for reaching out to the muslim world but moving from propping up dictatorships to then supporting civil islam political parties doesnt exactly send a bold message that the us supports secular democratic values that uphold human rights gohmert bet you one your wild accusation would accusing you kkk members advisors our you were that  thing with glenn beck that young girl now one you do know that gohmerts districtis a hotbed of white supremecist activity right  the chance of having a kkk member in his political circle are actually quite high from marshall myselfthats not really the bad part of east texas we dont really have the kkkstyle stuff there just gardenvariety overt racism ahh the good ol s i aint saying theres nothing wrong with them i just dont like them racism i am from wv and thats about  of the population here random dudei am not racisti just prefer white people menoim pretty sure thats racism its quite natural to gravitate towards people that resemble yourself whether that means tall white skinny whatever racism is when you dislike people for being a race what youve described is a guy that feels comfortable around people like him unless he followed his statement up with and all niggers are thieves anyway then no hes not a racist more likely hes just a simpleton  wow crazy relevant thank you yea thats exactly what i described he followed it up with and i really appreciate the contributions made by all members of our society i am sorry if you construed my first remarks as racists i just feel more comfortable around white people then we all gathered around and sang a song about how jackasses try to justify other peoples responses as not being what they blatantly are it went something likesuck on my junk jpreston suck on my junk a lot cause were all in the mood for some bullshit and youve got us feeling alright huh i didnt originally downvote you because you had a point i just wanted to clarify something but now i realize youre a bit of a prick so enjoy marshall highfiveour next door neighbors routinely share overtly racist shit with us apparently they feel that if they see a fellow white person theres no problem just being racist as fuck its not about what is promoted but what is tolerated  overt racism leads to tolerance of batshit crazy statements about obama and being open to someone doing whats necessary to bring down the dictatorship of the socialist muslim from kenya thats arguably worse because its much harder to pin down the ones responsible for spreading it in part because now you are not allowed to point out someone as racist without being racist yourself   any geographical region that elects characters like gohmert or ron paul must be hotbeds of white supremacy  love him or hate him implying anything racist about ron paul is just pretty ignorant i guess you missed his opposition of the civil rights act his sponsoring of the iranian student expulsion act his speeches in front of confederate flags and his newsletters  deleted yes it does the confederate flag was the flag of a nation that based its identity on white supremacyits like saying the nazi flag doesnt always equal nazism  order was only restored in la when it came time for the blacks to collect their welfare checks the poor lined up at the post office to get their handouts since there were no deliveries  and then complained about slow service ive lived in that area all my life never met a white supremacist nor have i seen evidence of kkk activity i am not a gohmert fan by the way  i have lived in longview for most of my life  ive seen a number of white supremacist tattoos and such around this part of east texas  my grandparents were robbed by the kkk in the s because they thought they were jewish  most people around here are racist to some degree  gohmert talks just like most of them  he is a good an accurate representative of my districts interests    im in longview as well tattoos mean nothing to me this area was referred as a hotbed of activity do you believe that  i know its purely anecdotal but i did walk into a mexican food restaurant to see a man with ss lightning bolts tattooed on his neck and a giant iron cross tattooed on his head he was there with his inbred family i understand that you may believe that it isnt a hotbed for racist activity but the fact that youve lived here your hole life probably doesnt give you a whole lot of perspective i cant think of one place ive ever lived besides maybe the foothills of kentucky where openly displaying racist tattoos wouldnt cause more of an uproar you saying tattoos mean nothing to you kind of shows the lack of perspective you possess  nothing  so i guess youre getting a forehead swastika next week ya p ha ok you got me i try not to judge people based on their tattoos  waitwhy wouldnt you tattoos are a choice you made when someone starts tattooing white supremacist icons on themselves theyre painting a pretty clear picture of their belief system tats mean everything you have a wp tat i will ask you about then confront you to your face to many people do not speak up when your see or hear racist crap call the boneheads out confront them if thats your thing shame them do what ever it takes to wash this country of that garbage i overheard some old women at olive garden talking about how the kkk was set up in lufkin but they couldnt get going in jasper  also the aryan brotherhood has a known presence in the area wait which olive garden in lufkin out by the movie theatre chilis and the burke center  it was maybe a year or so ago that i heard this it was while i was waiting on a togo order damn seems like good quality and lovely service really can be found in many places in the us i used to live in a town south of jasper i can confirm that its a hotbed of racist activity but not as bad as it was prior to jbj that incident shined a real spotlight on se texas no evidencenoneand from thisthe lufkinhudson area is a hotbed of activity for both the abt and the aryan circle just my experience certainly not a hotbed of white supremacist activity  i grew up in dallas and never met a cowboy  oh how racist can his district be    oh god east texas really really east texas well at least vidor isnt in his district so that says something right offtopic in the texas panhandle where half of my family is from you can find vitiated old buildings in the middle of nowhere with fuck obama on them also my grandmother was rather racist but she was kinda mean to begin within bowie texas former sundown town which is in the more north central part of the state they had one black family when i lived there in the s they moved rather quicklyokay some parts of texas are really fucked up but it aint all bad el paso is nice makes up for dallas right  actually dallas voted for obama in  and  plus gore in   most large urban counties apart from tarrant county voted for obama tides are shifting i was mainly talking about dallas drivers and the neverceasing construction on the interstate but good to be pleasantly surprised i was not aware of those voting trends i happen to be used to all the construction around here it really breaks up the monotony when they switch to working on the other side of the road and i have to take a brand new route to work in the morning the general trend is citiesurban regions are more liberal rural regions are more conservative that the cities in texas swing more democrat isnt that surprising its because our representation systems give much more weight to rural voters compared to urban ones based on demographic trends conservatives in a truly equal x voters to  politico would be a rarity austin is awesome tyler texas  never been to a more racist city you need to have a chat with utheoldamerican then my dad lives there ive driven through many small towns full of trash all over the state of texas and oklahoma tyler on the other hand is different it really throws you for a loop because that town is considerably large for the amount of worthless pieces of shit people that live there thatsthejokegif you do know that youre not close to what anyone would call correct right im from tyler and its not even a lukewarmbed of white supremacist activity its a very conservative town though racism here exists just like it does in every state in the union and tyler is the only town in tx district  no there are several towns in district  cant you get anything right im sorry you appear to be unable to understand subtlety even when applied with a sledgehammer  yes there is more than one town in the district  the link i provided in the original post showed them  do you know what a link is perhaps you should read up on the word irony it was present in my previous post oh alliteration which type of irony the fuck it is  who says hes not in the kkk himselfedit  whoa gt who well until  there was a former kkk member serving as a us senator  who personally filibustered the civil rights act of  for  hours no strom thurmond died in  and he filibustered the civil rights act for over  hrs the longest filibuster in history thurmond was never a member of the kkk though he was one of three congressmen to switch parties from democrat to republican in the two years following   i was talking about robert byrd dwv  he actually led his local chapter of the klan byrd is a stupid argument he disavowed them what excuse does the gop have gt byrd is a stupid argument he disavowed them what excuse does the gop havethat they didnt have a klansman in the senate and that the klan was considered the militant wing of the democratic party not the republican party robert kkk byrd d  wvthanks for playing though you mean the same robert byrd who publicly admitted his mistake and denounced the klanas opposed to thurmond who was repeatedly reelected by the republicans and went to his grave an unrepentant segregationist  thats the guy you won thanks for playing  gt thanks for playingwhat a dick gtyour wild accusation would be like someone accusing you of having kkk members as advisors our like saying you were part of that  thing with glenn beck and that young girl or perhaps holding in your hand the names of  communists in the state department agreed  ill bet he has a whole list of brotherhood members just like mccarthy and the communists im sure that he has some sort of list yes right hurr in mah pocket i vote democrat because their corruption and cronyism is at least understandable between reasonably cogent individuals  the republican party is just bat shit crazy and their corruption scares the shit out of me this pile of shit doesnt smell as bad as that other pile of shit so i really prefer to step in that one as opposed to the other its just common sense right the gop corruption is so patriotic that it doesnt care if the nation survives just as long as they are wearing red white and blue after the shitstorm calms down actually the accusations are not that far off base do some research form your own opinion then decide if you agree or disagree actually its up to the person presenting an argument to include proof which substantiates it  please provide links to legitimate sources so not theblaze or breitbart thanks that offer some sort of proof of this claim and ill be happy to read it  but youre the one saying obama has muslim brotherhood members advising him so you provide the proof  thats how that works  actually does this mean you will accept cnn msnbc as legitimate sources stop being lazy do the research on your own this way it becomes your proof without outside influence the burden of proof is on you put up or shut up do your own research the record is skipping time to play another guess he doesnt understand that in order to form an opinion you should already have the evidence of said opinion before speaking out and proving you are  ignorant welcome to the willful ignorance of the republican party  heres my researchnope not a damn thing to prove muslim brotherhood involvement in this administration not one damn thing care to prove my research wrong  exactly they should just study it out  youre the one making the claimif youre going to claim that the administration is full of muslim brotherhood members its on you to actually prove that you dont just get to declare yourself right until someone proves you wrong debate and discussion does not work that way  ok you name one  since you read up and stuff clearly you just need to study it up study it out ftfy i am not saying all the decisions have been bad many that affect you and i are questionable until you take the time to do research on your own you are spewing out nonsense take the time to educate yourself  youre acting on the assumption that i am not well educated or at least educated on this particular subject  i would like to invite you to reconsider before i ask for your sources and then systematically demolish any source suggesting the muslim brotherhood is represented in obamas administration you are assuming allot for a proclaimed well educated person if you did do any research the only thing you would be demolishing is your own opinionbtw when i say educate yourself it is meant as learn on your own i never questioned your education the thing about the younger generation if it is not done for them it is not true or fact lazy people you still have yet to name one muslim brotherhood part of obamas administrationim going to write you off in    do you own research gtyou are assuming allot for a proclaimed well educated personwhat the only person ive seen make any assumption is you all were doing is being skeptical like any person with critical thinking skills i need to be provided with proof before i believe something and youre refusing to provide any most likely because there is none from what i can see youre just assuming there are muslim brotherhood members in the obama administration gtif you did do any research the only thing you would be demolishing is your own opinionummm ive done my research and i cant find anything to back up what youre saying at that point usually youd provide me with some evidence i dont think youre going to do that though because there is none gtbtw when i say educate yourself it is meant as learn on your own i never questioned your education the thing about the younger generation if it is not done for them it is not true or fact lazy peoplelol this is just an excuse that allows you to avoid supporting your own claim the idea that you have to support the claims you make didnt originate with the current generation because theyre too lazy to do research einstein didnt say nothing with mass can travel at the speed of light prove it oh no you do thatso you can just avoid giving any evidence any when we demand some you call us lazy and tell us to look for ourselves ive looked for myself but im assuming youre just going to attack the sources i used and tell me im dumb or something  i read many of your post and replies you appear to be a  year old adolescent that has never been with a real women you have strong political views that borderline socialism those views conflict with the constitution you are promuslim  i never said anyone was a associated with the muslim brotherhood i said it is not that far off do your own research decide for yourself i do not see a name in that post why did you chose to respond if you did not want to answer the question that seems like a pretty questionable decision she knows they will get slammed when they admit infowars is their source of this information  if i posted a names ignorant reddit would say i am wrong if you take the time to research on your own the research is you from there you can form your opinion without outside influence so you continue to dodge the question and provide exactly zero information to back your claim  i claim that you are a member of the muslim brotherhood if the readers would take the time to do the research on their own and form their own opinion they will find that i am right i have now provided even more information than you have to back up my claim will anyone reading this take the time to find out no of course they wont the claim is absurd and i have not met even the lowest bar for backing it up you are relying purely on confirmation bias to sway people because you have nothing to back up your claims  that actually goes for almost all of the research you have probably done as well i can confirm based on my own independent research that ufourcounters is indeed a card carrying member of the muslim brotherhood milaha i believe you solely based on the fact that your argument was more persuasive than then those of that dirty muslim spy fourcounters i am not dodging anything or trying to sway anyone as the rest of you are attempting to do all i have said do your own research if you and the others were not lazy you would find the information on your ownmy personal opinion both democratic and republican parties are joined at the hip voting for one is the same as voting for the other gtuntil you take the time to do research on your own you are spewing out nonsense take the time to educate yourself thats not how logic works unless youre an idiot you dont assume something is correct until its been proven wrong i think santa clause exists obviously im right go do your research  by research do you mean pull out of your ass im still not seeing a single name from your socalled research nor one from gohmert if that is how you lean and the only way you are able to comprehend that is your choice so with all that research of yours you still couldnt come up with a single name congrats you just proved gohmert is full of shit based in your screen name your replies are all politically motivated to suit your thinking and only your point of view i never said anyone was a associated with the muslim brotherhood i said it is not that far off do your own research decide for yourself see the thing is that research isnt needed or warranted to counter a baseless assumption no research needs to be done here his comments had no merit and were downright asinine  then you are a idiot you must believe everything the democratic and republican parties publishron paul had some good ideas not saying he would have made a better president he did have better ideas for america than clinton obama romney this is how you troll people very subtle dodges the question gracefully getting people riled up just enough to get them questioning but not enough to dismiss you very professional the problem with reddit there are three reddits within reddit some days i fall into all three categories intelligence redditignorant redditstupid redditthe internet has taught some have learned this  that everything you read on the internet regardless of the source should not be considered reliable and requires additional research to learn the unedited real truth reddits problem most are lazy judgmental and if it does not fit within their narrow thinking it is wrong    troll i read many of your post and replies you appear to be prousa yet you are a sympathizer what i do not understand about you whos side are you really on  no we just like proof when someone makes wild and insane claims and please dont tell me to go do my research ive done my research and its obvious that youre wrong oh and every day you fall into ignorant and stupid reddit  im going to bite because i find this admonition to do your research form your own opinion pretty frequently used among people of a certain bent would you care to point an inquisitive stranger in the general direction of relevant sources i understand that citations may seem awfully stuffy and stickuptheass but this attitude of the truth is out there if you just research it is not helpful to anyone  you are right do your own research is frequently used on reddit i am sure it is do to how many lazy people browse redditpoint you in the direction to do your own researchwwwgooglecomwwwbingcomwwwduckduckgocom  lol obvious troll account is obvious just because i love to play games i did my own researchi came across claims

some of them spoke out against the bush administrations imposition on civil liberties following  but plenty of nonmuslims did the sameso tell me did i miss anyone because i dont see a smoking gun i dont even see a dripping water pistol i have researched and have found no indication that a member or members of the muslim brotherhood is working on the whitehouse and none of you will give me a single name look harder or really look reddit is full of fucking morons make your own decision of reddit cannot tell anyone why they are for gay marriage or against gay marriage reddit follows the stupid person in front of themnone of my posts were about who was who i took the time to read many of your replies you are either a muslim or a muslim sympathizer  you sound so  wise since i have not been given a name by any  of the great and sage men calling other people names and accusing others them i must be a muslim  wow you simply amaze me i took the time to read many of your posts and replies you have strong political point of views why are you pro socialist and not proamerican so the test of being proamerican is to agree with you you are so broad minded    yet insane congressman texas theyre trying to corner the market ill bet bachmann wont willing to move bachmann is another crazy who thinks the muslim brotherhood has infiltraded the white house all the media and possibly all of the government i think shes more in it for the publicity and just tries to appease the more radical rightwing voters this guy is scary because he actually believes what he says she gained national notoriety when she wanted a mccarthyist style investigation of congressmen for their patriotism then she made all these weird statements about one world government fema conspiracies then she got really nutty the woman is as crazy as one might assume by her demeanor maybe palin wouldve been a better example i doubt she can even come up with an original opinion her staffers just feed her what to say my brain hurts please change to infiltrate i really doubt it shes still worried that iraq might get nukuelar weapons i dont know she did go to law school and pronunciation  spelling everyone always gives gwb a hard time for this too dont get me wrong its hilarious but they arent as stupid as a lot of people make them out to be why the hell am i defending someone who claimed she wasnt a witch in a political ad youre thinking of christine odonnell well then thats another point for bachmann i guess im you has to be the worst campaign slogan ever interestingly enough im not a witch is one of the best ive ever heard im going to get a lot of flack for this but the schools they went to and graduated from have very little to do with their actual intellectual acumen  sometimes its a just a joke but people really do pay their way into these institutions  if youve donated enough money or have enough prestige its expected that your offspring will get a diploma by the end of their stay   this new yorker article goes into great detail on what places like harvard are all about  the part about equating the harvard brand to ferrari and how its managed the same way is really illuminating  ive got sincere doubts about that in my defense typo mixed with having a new linux install where the language hadnt been selected in my spell checker im ocd and usually obsessive about spelling no youre not because you still havent fixed it crazy midwestern housewives vs wealthy racist knownothingsthe only way to win is not to play til white goldman sachs executives members the muslim brotherhood that would explain their actions  texas mortified this guy speaks small the state yup i am it boggles my mind that he and cruz are what we have to show for representative democracy in action   i want hutchison back and thats saying a lot rep steve stockman  i certainly am texas is proud this guy speaks for them in neighborhood guys gohmert sit yelling their conspiracy theories the street corner id hate to the district where they elect this to represent them the legislature im from gohmerts district and its actually a pretty big mystery weve only lived here for about a year but the area has a pretty good number of intelligent liberalleaning people in fact theres a huge initiative in my city one of three proper cities in the district to encourage people to eat vegan the antigmo people are loud and while i hate the antivaccination crowd those people tend to be liberalleaning as well and we have a good number of themthere are plenty of churches and there are two megachurches in longview but its not like this homogeneous region of gohmert clonesbasically its really weird and i have no idea how he keeps winning by such huge margins here liberal leaning overly religious people tend to not really be that liberal the antigmo crowd are marginally more intelligent than climate deniers and the antivax crowd are absolute morons those are both groups that run with the conspiracy theory nuts and that is gohmerts bread and butter they dont see left vs right they see everyone conspiring against them those groups though tend to be outspoken against gohmert the people ive talked to who are antigmo view the entirety of the republican establishment as the ones on the side of big business the harrison county democrats for instance make it clear that theyre against such practicesi agree that youre still dealing with conspiracy mindsets but from what ive seen you have rational centerleftists and nutty leftists the church comment was a concession to gohmerts base as a possibility in longview im going to guess that only a small percentage of the people you just mentioned actually vote or campaign for a better candidate i dont want to believe that but given the numbers youre probably right do something about it next go around we can do this the republicans must be around there somewhere  the district has a cook rating of r which is incredibly high  john boehners district is only r and thats still pretty high  according to wikipedia your district was jerrymandered in  to bring in more republicans to defeat a democratic incumbent  it also describes tyler and longview as republican strongholds obviously they would have to be with the margins hes winning all im suggesting is that its not as loudly republican as youd expect one might think our district was all americanconfederate flags and obstinate hate the republican base that votes for him is less culturally prominent than one would think given the particular level of support he has when you gerrymander a district you want to put as many people from the other side in it as possible while still leaving your side with a solid majority i have no idea if this is what happened there but it would actually make sense to take areas with a bunch of hardcore republicans and put them in the same district with a bunch of crazy vegan antivaccinationists but not enough of the latter to actually win anything this gives you all of the advantages of a solidly republican district while effectively disenfranchising a whole bunch of people who would vote against you the same of course can be and is done on the democratic side his headquarters are in tyler and smith county was dry until   he wins with the old money religious vote gtonly lived here for about a yearthats probably why youre confused i grew up in tyler and the level of cultural republicanism there is insane people there are just going to keep voting for gohmert and the other crazy guys because thats what theyve always done theyre not interested in considering issues and creating informed opinions or thinking for themselves they just blindly accept whatever their parents and their green acres baptist church pastor tell themyou notice the liberals because theyre loud you dont notice the rankandfile conservatives because they arent loud because they dont have to be when they hold a  majority you should run in the next election  i wouldnt win even if i pretended to be religious whats clear is that gohmerts strategy actually works somehow moreover i feel that the best strategy to beat him would be to run as a conservative albeit a slightly less nutty one i lean centerleft but im also pragmatic enough to say better a not nutty conservative than a nutty one the democrats here wouldnt necessarily support such a strategy and gohmert has his primary on lock i too am from gohmerts district tyler is becoming quite a metropolitan city it has its growing pains but what quicklyexpanding city doesnt being a college town helps with some of the liberalness that is pushing it to a more moderate ideology  i think why gohmert continues to get elected is because of apathy if everyone knows the candidate and the area youre in isnt a blighted city like detroit just begging for change voters say meh hes as good as anyone else might as well longvrew born and raised  gohmert is a constant embarrassment for me  he makes the daily show regularly texas is one of the most partisan gerrymandered states in the country  gtthe antivaccination crowd those people tend to be liberalleaningltgeneralizationgt yeah but they are just a time bomb waiting to go off as soon as vaccines are finally deemed safe they might start marketing homeopathic remedies or doing some other crazy liberal things ltgeneralizationgt deleted and  million rep louie gohmert unspoken official officer the ku klux klan dont stoop to his level lets call him what he clearly is a racist moron who should not be allowed to purchase a weapon let alone be a member of the house its not about his level its a fact i hadnt heard that links articles pictures i live in his district and if you know something i dont like him being an official officer of the ku klux klan i have the means to get that information to the public and get him voted out of office next election  not everyone in his district supports him so ill be anxiously awaiting any supporting articles pictures stories etc that you have on this claim   you see his margins of victory he is a lock he got  percent last time he is your congressman until he becomes your senator is this the mccarthyism i thought this foolishness faded to its hilarious idiocy keeps coming reason is there people there who intrenched this fantasy world to people this platform this sad very sad its worse than mccarthyism since ostensibly communism was genuinely ideologically opposed to the practices and policies of the united states even if mccarthys paranoia was overblown it was betterinformed which is not saying much exactly i say we start looking through peoples affiliations and then maybe start publicly persecuting them cant let the commii mean muslims win i dont think we will ever grow past the possibility of witch hunting and if we do we are far from it right now  we are in the cold war    ill admit it isnt exact but it is close enough that all the old rule books from by gone years once thought thrown away are being reused  replace communist references with islamterrorism  iraq is the new vietnam  afghanistan the new korea war  israelpalestine divide is eastwest germany crudely down to the divided capital of jerusalem  iran is the off and on ersatz for the ussr when youre out if ideas you can always try organizing a witch hunt or a lynching they were using that kind of talk to knock down health care reform wellit with fair amount certainty that gohmerts office greatly influenced members the aryan brotherhood is true look record you should have said that in the manner of faux newssome people say gohmerts staff has aryan brotherhood members and former kkkers on it many people say you make a good point  shouldnt the tea party rebadged the kkk brotherhood im all for that sort of truth in packaging really  what about them strikes you as particularly racist  is it their opposition to obamas policies yes actually anyone who doesnt agree with obama hates all black people facts spitting on african american congressmen for one ah okay  so one tea party member spat on a black guy  did he do it because the congressman was black  that seems like an awfully big assumption to make wouldnt you say making large assumptions about what any conservative would do or why is part of bbs stock in trade he always believes the worst about a conservative and never believes anything negative about a liberal  oh please  yea nevermind all those minorities they elected they were prolly using them like slaves right guys  good idea well except there are africanamericans in the tea party and latinos maybe not a good idea i wouldnt be surprised if the teabaggers were renting them thats got to be it since individuals in those ethnic groups cant think on their own and stuff well like most people they tend not to take actions contrary to their own interests paying them sufficiently can tip that balance also they might just be really stupid like most other teabaggers maybe they dont think perpetual welfare is in their best interestthere is a transcendental movement beyond victimhood and helplessness called self reliance  until they can avail themselves of it you have to love rpolitics sometimes all blacks think alike if you see one that isnt a democrat they are being paid by republicans they should know their role and vote democratic because we know whats good for them as opposed to illegal immigrant amnesty in which case the democrats are just buying them outright thats quite racist most teabaggers would resent such a comment and argue that they have the right to own blacks and messicans outright like rand paul if unequipped with a legitimate argument spew bullshityoure doing rpolitics right not that thats good the default reflex of the left calling anyone who disagrees with them a racist  how classysorry but youre a racist for usurping that horrible judgment of people by their skin color for your own political gain   chance youre a white dork who has never understood what conservatism is all about  lol enjoy your bliss no because the kkk was full of democrats no not racist but number one with racists im pretty sure its both at this point sadly  the democratic and republican parties are joined at the hip voting for either candidate gets the people the same results get behind more political parties more choices better choices because you hear about something having bipartisan support everyday rightthey really arent the same do you understand how the two party system really works has nothing to do with bipartisan when will iq test requirement office as george carlin said look at how stupid the average person is and realize half of the country is dumber than that stupid people elect stupid representatives its as simple as that the very moment enough of the public demands it which will never happen you dont need to pass an iq test as soon as its a requirement for voting when they are found to actually be indicative of

the  presidential campaign a may ppp survey found that  percent of  likely gop primary voters classified the president under that religion since his reelection in november  a host of conservative voices have referred to obama as a socialist back in march gop strategist henry barbour told the hill that weve got a socialist in office right now earlier in december televangelist pat robertson

the jews only technically in that they control the lizard people who control the media  jews controlled by lizards controlled by muslim socialists where do the reverse vampires factor in between the illuminati and the mudmen i agree with does ill credit wit to be fair and i happen to agree that he is witty and very charming he has a team of writers for events like this  he can still pull the jokes off bad presentation will kill a good joke most higher up politicians probably could theyre professional speakers fool me once shame on  shame on you fool me  you cant get fooled againthis is an apolitical comment meant merely to show that presidents arent always good public speakers to be fair that is one of my favorite presidential quotes and its fool me once shame on shame on you gangster hands a fooled man cant get fooled again lets look at the clip im going to say uthehm was correct  i saw that clip  times and i am pretty sure i am still right but i apologize if that correction sounded bitchy george w bush isnt a genius but he probably deliberately affected some of his stupidity to appeal to his conservative base that holds intelligence in contempt one instance of one politician out of context does not a point make he said most politicians could  obamas comedic timing is still impressive hell he was way funnier than conan at this thinghe does have excellent writers remember when the seal fell off his podium and he just filled the time whole they adjusted the camera yeah john mccains jokes are totally awesomebomb bomb bomb bomb bomb iran this kills the joke yeah thats a good example nogeezhis writers god damn good lovable spoken like a true redditor  pointing out obvious bias on reddit and the truth that in fact not everyone in the usa shares the lovable sentiment  or based on  election results like an american citizen personally i hope that lovability had very little to do with the way people voted then again we are talking about the american public isnt the reason people were said to vote for bush in part at least was because he was the kind of guy youd sit and have a beer with which citizens one in four voted for him one in four voted against him and two in four didnt vote at all this is not a mandate this is barely a boydategore vidal on this sort of reasoning when reagan was electednote i voted for obama but i dont buy into this idea as readily as most just because half of americans are too lazy to vote doesnt mean he doesnt have a mandate in fact the americans who didnt vote essentially said that they gave the right to an electoral mandate to whoever did vote you cant say he doesnt have a mandate due to their laziness believe me as a campaigner everyone was given a chance to register and vote we hit every door and every person so if they didnt get out and do it its their own fault i understand what youre saying but i disagree fundamentally i think thats a far too idealistic attitude its not really about people being unable to vote though there are many people who cannot in my opinion its about how meaningless voting feels to people for example i voted for obama in california i feel like it meant nothing and even if i had voted for jill stein which i should have or romney my vote would have done absolutely nothing at the individual level my vote was practically meaningless there are many reasons not to vote not just laziness blaming people and telling them they deserve this or that is both dangerous and distasteful we have a two party system with very little difference between the two at the presidential level you cant lump everyone into one category and you certainly cant blame those who are legitimately disenfranchisedregardless the point still remains the quote still stands logically speaking a majority of the overall citizenry did not vote for obama or reagan no president receives a mandate from the people and any opposition to him is perfectly legitimate and trust me that label is very hard for me to grant to the gop but the opposition is not exclusive to themedit i guarantee you i would not be getting as many downvotes with these two posts if romney had won the election  nearly half the voters didnt vote for him and not even close to half of the citizenry even voted actually  of eligible voters voted in the  general electionwhile less than  and  it was higher than other elections back to   was about the same as   is nearly half and hes also technically right that less than half of the citizenry voted not even close was incorrect even though turnout was over  of eligible voters that was only about  out of about  million which i would say is close to half of the citizenrypoint being by far most americans didnt vote for obama gtpoint being by far most americans didnt vote for obamabut it doesnt matter because they didnt vote they use eligible voters to determine the amount of people who vote because the  million general population number includes people who cant vote including children convicted felons and immigrants so yes more than  of eligible us citizens voted including some that likely live overseas twofifths is nearly half in the way that fox news is nearly accurate youre giving them too much credit you dont vote you dont countfrankly though the nonvoting demographics  everyone under  basically skew liberal if they had voted nothing would have changed point being most americans have never voted for anyoneyou can not use the entire population of the country as that includes people under voting age as well as those who have been disenfranchised  look at the line marked vap that is the percentage of all citizens who were of age to vote  it is smaller because it includes the disenfranchised and a few other groups including i believe those who legally attempted to vote but were denied or discountedelections are decided by those who show up  and those who are allowed to show up yeah as opposed to the usual landslide elections right and yet the majority of voters still did vote for him why do you thing only liberals because reddit is mostly liberal are capable of love and conservatives are hating misogynistic racist bastards with poor dental hygieneim not saying youre wrong just wondering why you think that i think you completely missed his point  i wish was socialist muslim as long as he was secular id agree i love this i consider republican however im sick tired the obamabashing i live texas where mention obama treated treasonironically its nice to this great man take the criticism stride keep trying hardest the job was elected to do president obama you proud i agree the obama bashing is terrible and is driving this country backwards  in nc its gotten so bad the batshit tea partiers have been so vocal about opposing anything obama supports  it reeks of masked racism too  its masked  i mean maybe like a pantyhose mask but its never seemed much more opaque than that to me well some of it is blatant but for example theirs a tea party advocate here who writes articles criticizing anything obama does and he uses super weak reasoning and anyone with halfabrain can see through how bigoted it is and he goes out of his way to dismiss any notion that his views are bigoted with the logical fallacy of appeal to tradition  its so bad he wrote an article how our town doesnt need to build a solar energy farm despite the jobs it could bring because obama subsidises solar energy and fracking for natural gas is the better option because theres so much of it  he mentioned nothing of how controversial fracking is or any plans for a fracking to come to our town the whole article was basically obama like solar energy solar energy badsorry to ramble but its crap like that which hardens bigoted policies and encourages younger generations to keep them in policy gtlogical fallacy of appeal to tradition yup and traditionally we didnt have a black president i run away from anyone who spouts values politics or who waxes nostalgic for the great society of the s yeah the guy is definitely of the persuasion that civil rights were a bad move he also had a great article how the boy scouts shouldnt allow gay members because they didnt when he was a scout and it worked out pretty great for him and other white straight people  i feel the jokes year thats because people continue to say the same things about him i feel like muslim socialist was big for the first campaign but the reelection campaign was more like the economy is horrible and your policies dont work yeah youre right the economy isnt improving at all   talking about election talking points too complex a concept for this thread i see now what you were actually saying   nonono its still bushs fault dont you see because fdr was able to fix the great depression in four years right this is a once in a generation global collapse it isnt just some market correction thats easy to fix not to mention what can he do with a republican legislature that oppeses him at every turn  god bless i help think that the heads the people those pictures huge  obama admids was muslim socialist go to bed spatula man  i feel like he was trying to satire the people who originally called obama a muslim socialist well i expected more sense of humor in a subreddit called rhumor tell the benghazi again the nonissue propped up by the rightwing echo chamber uh no thanks they do a pretty good job making fun of themselves without a punchline on that one  you have got to be joking waityou really are that disgusting of a person way to play spin politics on the lives of  good men you are dealing with children he acts as if what he just said isnt the same thing that echoed in the air when chris mathews farted in the shower  i forget that this place is full of indoctrinated  somethings who have very little life experience it is i do find it amazing how much your ideas change in  years though give them time they will wise up yeah the biggest joke obama ever foisted upon the nation was his presidency  a bunch of inept dishonest incompetent fools turning the knobs on what used to be a great nation but hey sorority whores can get free birth control now even if they go to private religious schools  its a real win for the nation gt sorority whores can get free birth control now even if they go to private religious schools its a real win for the nationyou sound like a hungry troll  not a troll  i cannot abide moochers  if the aforementioned sorority whores want to lay on their backs and be used like sexually disposable artifacts which they evidently are i couldnt care less i do not however wish to pick up the tab for their behavior  at the very least they should admit what they are and charge accordingly   at least that way they could afford her own medical care and the rest of us grown ups wouldnt have to pay for their various diseases  gt us grown upsi was going to make a cutting yet hilarious reply to this but then i got to thinking about how unutterably sad your life must be and i got all bummed out oh dont feel sad junior  i am quite happy at the moment   why  i am busy not hiring people i am busy helping other companies move jobs out of the us  i am busy not starting any new businesses  i am busy not giving money to any cause that has the slightest chance of being affliated with left wing actionyou and people like you deserve precisely what is coming its tragic that the thoughtful and reasonable people that work hard will also be harmed by your stupidity gt you are undoubtedly a troll but ill play its okay because people that think like you are a dying breed then we can make real progress and one day you will be dead and your actions will be of little significance to anything save for making you feel better but of course its all about you vs them anyway right i dont think you actually know much about the things youre describing aside from maybe what you hear on rush limbaughs show youre a silly person nothing wrong with sex better for everyone if its safer especially at the point of the governments gun amirite  i dont care what the sorority whores do  in fact the less safe sex practiced among liberals the better  no group more deserves stds and all that go with that   i however  care that they are forcing private sector religious institutions to do things that are in direct conflict with those religious institutions beliefs and i am not catholic btw so you believe that all corporate subsidies should be cut too or do you only believe in the cuts which try and control peoples social behaviors there should be no welfare for anyone  not for corporations not for soccer moms not for lazy ghetto scum not for white trash not for sleazy sorority whores  no one  you are not entitled to the money of other people   government exists solely to keep us free not make one group of people pick of the tab the for the bottomfeeding scumbags in society ie the core democrat base  to the extent that government needs money to do this taxation is proper  but ripping money out of one persons pocket and putting it in anothers is plainly immoral  which is why the left likes it so much  the left never met a slimy cause they couldnt support not for physically amp mentally disabled people eitherour society is a cooperative one where we are committed towards helping each other live this is how all of human history happened this is how we ever progressed beyond singleminded primates you talk of other peoples entitlement complexes but yours reeksyou did not get yourself where you are today alone do not act like it you are wrong gt our society is a cooperative oneit is not cooperative to take money from one citizen and place it in the pockets of another  that is called stealing  the problem with all you people is that you think your so very special that you get to decide what should be done with other peoples property  well guess what  you are not all that special and you are not particularly equipped to decide just what works best  cooperation is voluntary not done under threat of force  which is how government always operates   if you dont think so try not paying your taxesgt not for physically amp mentally disabled people eitherthats a red herring  that is not where the majority of entitlements go  entitlements go to older people that have failed to save for their own retirement  they go to pay people whove had more children than they want to pay for themselves  they go to people with personally bad behaviors to bail them out of the results of those bad behaviors  they go to buy cell phones for people hoping to buy their votes in the next election  you live in a world of illusion  there is no constitutionally enumerated power to proved welfare for anyone  rich or poor  these are just cheap vote buying tactics  if you care so veeeeeerrrrry much spend your money to support the charities you care about and quit dipping into my wallet because you think you know better what to do with my money  some ghetto crack whore or some white trash piece of garbage or some drug addict or some hiv positive promiscuous male prostitute is not more entitled to the proceeds of my lifes work than my own familygt ou did not get yourself where you are today aloneno i didnt  i got there because i had a family that cared and a rule of law that made success possible  i am happy to pay for the  government necessary to maintain that rule of law  i am unwilling to pick the tab for the drug addicts drunks whores and losers that the left pretends are all victims when they are nothing more than people with self inflicted gunshot wounds  before you presume to further lecture me let me clear this up for you  i grew up poor among poor people  and let me tell you something sparky theyre mostly poor for a reason  their own choices and behaviors  you want to prop up lousy behavior be my guest  with your money not mine  im done paying for losersthe left  pretending stealing is noble and then screaming when somone calls them out for their moral turpitude do you understand what sandra fluke was actually advocating for or what the birth control coverage regulations actually do hint they do not involve free birth control in any sense whatsoever they involve the forcing of private sector religious institutions to do something in driect contravention of their stated religious beliefs offer insurance that provides birth control coverage but since lord obama and the rest of the pusfilled left have decided that being able to be a whore and prevent pregnancy at the same time is a right the constitutional protections on religious liberty can just be tossed out right  after all hopenchange is our new messiah  the only religion that is acceptable is the state itself   you people are revolting  i cannot wait to watch you drown in the sewer floodgates youre opening  in the mean time im busy shipping as much work offshore as humanly possible  this nation no longer deserves the blessings heaped upon it  but you admit that its not actually free right you do understand that there is no mention no plan and no reality to free birth control right   despite the frothing at the mouth can you at least admit this is a false premise  thanks in advance its isnt free in the absolute sense since someone always has to pay for it  but the sorwhores that demand this are not paying full market value for the service  thats why they are forcing their schools to offer insurance  so they can lay the costs of their whoring off on other people as well sounds like you were turned down by some sorority girls in your past  you should work on your hatred a little harder  you have a winning personality i bet  i never wanted anything to do with the sorwhores  i dont need those kinds of disease and i prefer people with some class and tastei have a lovely personality  chicks dig me men want to be me children adore me and pets fawn all over me lol i bet you think bush was a great president huh  no just far better than the anal wart on the body politic we currently endure  out of curiosity what is your age and political education like  where do you get the facts that shape your opinionsi mean this in the friendliest way possible i am genuinely curious i have lived in three countries and immigrated to the us when i was young  i have studied the constitution and its surrounding foundational documents  ive seen where obamas road leads and it is a very bad ending  i am disgusted that sorority whores and their ilk are more important to the goverment than people just trying to live their lives peacefully without screwing their neighbors out of what is theirs  i am disgusted that about half the population would rather mooch than work for this too leads to a bad endgame ive seen communism socialism the echoes of facism and none of what obama wants will work  hes an evil leader and his followers are fools beyond words  fortunately i am just old enough now that i will not be here to watch the bitter harvest of what hes sown you seem really fixated on sorority whores how come lots of women use birth control even ones in gasp marriagesyou want to talk about restricting access to birth control then were going to have to talk about nicolae ceausescu were also going to need to talk about street kidsand come on this socialist nonsense is exactly that sure he isnt perfect but he isnt exactly left of center guy could have run as a republican before reagan at any rate yall grasp at any straws you can find because it just kills you to have a black president yup yall racist and no amount of backpedaling or deflection or red scare bullshit is going to make it any less obvious youre an idiot  the issue has nothing to do with restricting access to birth control  it has to do with forcing private sector institutions to offer it as an insurance benefit against their stated and explicit religious beliefs   rejoin us here when you manage to get your iq somewhere between profoundly stupid and just stupid which countriesthat was interesting thanks for the reply one in europe two in north america  i have also traveled extensively to work and play in about a dozen more mostly in europe but also in asia  my family also had reason to travel to eastern block nations during the terrible regimes of the ussr  i am painfully familiar with the obama road and where it leads did you know that in every nation the soviets took over they immediatly began instituting three things   gun control  restrictions on the use of cash and  restrictions on travel without detailed paperwork  sound familiarone more time no one can make political collectivitism work  whether it fails rapidly or slowly it always fails and it always does so while inflicting great pain upon individual citizens

credit mykhaylo palinchakshutterstockcom this week president obama met with muslim leaders in a private political meeting for the first time in his sixyear presidency the meeting set off predicatable angry reactions from the political right with fox news sean hannity even sayinghe wished obama had demanded that the leaders publicly denounce radical islam obama further raised the hackles of the christian right when he said at the national prayer breakfast that no religion has a monopoly on violence sayingand lest we get on our high horse and think this is unique to some other place remember that during the crusades and the inquisition committed terrible deeds in the name of christ slavery and jim crow all too often was justified in the name of christ the reaction to these comments was apoplectic rush limbaugh called it an insult to christianity the tea party news network said obama threw christians under the bus the daily caller surmised that obamas remarks were designed to curb criticism of islam all of these critics failed to engage with the substance of what obama was saying the president was not attacking christianity he was simply noting that just as isis may be using the name of islam to rally followers to its violent agenda extremists within the christian faith have done the same thing historically violence has been in the mainstream of christianity throughout history if anything obama didnt go far enough in his remarks christianist violence isnt a relic of the crusades it continues today and in many of its forms is just as violent as what we are seeing from isis christian violence in the past century in the spring of  middle east historian juan cole decided to compare the body counts between violence committed by christians and that committed by muslims in the thcentury he found that muslim violence has claimed the lives of around  million people mostly during the iraniraq war and the war in afghanistan while violence by christians claimed the lives of close to  million people heres what that looks like on a pie graph    some of this christianled violence is wellknown the world wars the holocaust the colonial wars in southeast asia and africa critics of this analysis would be quick to say that this violence may have been by christians but it wasnt in the name of christianity but in virtually every conflict cole ticks off the combatants were overtly religious and often invoked their religion as part of their military campaigns just as many of the islamist militants today are not fighting solely due to a religious grievance but are organized around groups that share a common religious and cultural background but religion has played a more explicit role in some of the thcentury conflicts involving christians for example the  sectarian warfare in the balkans culminated in an explicit genocide against muslim bosnians by serbian orthodox christians as balkans researcher keith doubt explained in a  paper the serbian orthodox church was one of the prime movers in the campaign to scapegoat bosnian muslims and justify the eventual ethnic cleansing and genocide that took place he notes that the role of the church as protector of the serbian nation gave the church increasing social control and with this power clergy fermented a xenophobic and bigoted attitude towards muslims in formeryugoslavia the church there was so involved in the eventual atrocities it actually dispatched orthodox chaplins to bless serbian forces such as the elite panthers commando unit which has been accused of committing numerous atrocities before they set off on operations the church would offer serb warriors communion without requiring confession giving them absolution for the crimes they were committing to create a greater serbia if the serbian orthodox churchs role in the genocide in bosnia has been forgotten by many the role of catholic churches in rwandas genocide is likely even less known during that mass slaughter churches became sites of slaughter carried out even at the altar one of the figures indicted in the genocide there was father wenceslas munyeshyaka who used to wear a gun on his hip and colluded with a hutu militia who massacred hundreds of people seeking shelter in his church after the genocide concluded various catholic clergy actually helped church ministers who were guilty of murder flee the country and resettle elsewhere including one who allowed all of the men women and children hiding in his church to be killed when the church was bulldozed the bbc actually ran a story in  of a rwandan girl who converted to islam after the genocide because churches actively participated in it but mosques did not todays christian violence months before isiss brutal beheadings were turned into western headlines the associated press ran a single paragraph on a beheading that took place in the central african republic the paragraph noted dryly that a christian militia there beheaded a young muslim man one of the last muslims left in the village his colleagues had fled the story ended up in a blurb on page a of the new york times human rights watch goes deeper into the situation in a brief published in december  the vast majority of muslims in western parts of the country fled brutal attacks by christian and animist antibalaka militia in late  and early  those who were not able to reach cameroon or chad became trapped in the enclaves where they have spent months living in difficult conditions un officials as well as african union au misca and french sangaris peacekeepers supported evacuations in late  and early  helping thousands of muslims to seek safety including in cameroon  by december  an estimated  people most of them muslim had fled the country and another  were protected by peacekeepers in a handful of western enclaves  carnot yalok boda and berbrati among others in other words what isis is doing to yazidis and other groups it has deemed the enemy christian militias in the central african republic are doing to muslims we just arent hearing about it because the victims arent as easy to relate to as isiss western captives even the isis televised executions of journalists arent particularly unique to islamist terrorism theyre copying a technique pioneered by christianled mexican cartels who for years beheaded and otherwise assassinated journalists who objected to their agenda we rarely identify the cartels as christian in nature but there are deep financial links between mexican churches and the cartel organizations no monopoly on violence none of this is to argue that christians are uniquely violent that would be as wrongheaded as the fox news argument about islams insidiousness it is just to point out that any large organization with enough people in it is capable of succumbing to tribalism to the idea that our group is good and other groups are bad and should be feared or disenfranchised or even killed thats as true of christianity as it is islam or judaism or buddhism or any largescale ideology or religion president obama wasnt wrong if anything he understated his case zaid jilani is an alternet contributing writer follow

christians today commit the atrocities yester year apply to fight the violent muslim ideology then you will something gt now if you can determine why christians of today dont commit the atrocities of yester year and apply it to fight the violent muslim ideology then you will have somethingfunny you should say that gtsecularism is the reason why people have the mistaken impression that christianity has been reformed and isnt a threat to us the way islam has become no christianity has not been reformed its been leashedive said this kind of thing before but never so succinctly  thanks for that  dont mind if it goes in my arsenal i dont mind at all steal whatever appeals to you a million dollars appeals to me     your heart appeals to me not sure if hitting on me or going all hannibal lecter on me    probably the wrong forum to bring up the whole thou shalt not steal thinghow about dont be a dick what if he was a vagina he could literally swallow the money waddle out with it the guards would be none the wiser has no one in this forum hear of wheatons law spoken like a true internet pirate  hitchens said something along the lines of christianity being leashed or declawed or something similar i wish i knew the quote because he put it quite well  i would use the word leashed the problem with christianity being leashed is that it can be unleashed we have current events demonstrating what happens when you do youre right on the money one thing i encourage any white male to do when in the south engage a typical southern christian in a conversation and just let them run wherever it takes them if you dont let on that your an atheist or a secularist and allow them to think you agree with them its pretty likely theyll eventually discuss how we should just kill all muslims and atheists and gays deport all latinos and re  enslave blacks all this under a dominionist theocracy its kind of alarming how widespread this thinking is  i wouldnt exactly call that the typical white male of the south at all  i disagree as a white male living in the south that exact logic is on my fb feed far too often damn some pretty strong stereotypes youre throwing around there  its ok here because they are just southerners who gives a fuck what a bunch of backwards jesus loving bigots think i mean they are always stereotyping everyone anyway  i honestly wouldnt blame religion for that humans can twist and create whatever ideology they need to justify violent behavior religion is merely the cover at the surface of a more fundamental problem this is why you see both followers of main stream religion who are extremely kind and respectful and those who are ignorant and destructive i dislike the mindset of this group believes in x we should just get rid of them i see it in both religious and nonreligious groups when did it become okay to get rid of people because they think differently id protect the right of even those who hate me to talk about it because the implications of not being able to are far worse as long as no one is breaking or bending the laws that weve set up for ourselves there shouldnt be a problem if we treat the content of common discourse as a sign for the health of our people then cure those afflicted by ignorance in ways that seek to drive them to change by their own volition just as the mindset of racial equality was pushed during the s and is still pushed today i did that just the other day it was fascinating that very thing happened the discussion was with the builder of my house i will do the right thing and let him know i am an atheist when the house is completed  really we bitch about stereotyping but this gets up voted i forget stereotyping is ok as long as it is against people we dont like  leashed by our education the leash is their tax exempt status or lack of it that sounds well and good but i disagree i think its simply our relative wealth westerners have much more to lose than the typical resident of a middle eastern country  agreed the leash is not just secularism but economic prosperity education and modernity in general imagine if america someday suffered economic collapse and regressed into a place with the educational and living standards of the third world and then was attacked and occupied by the invading army of a more advanced nation is it really so difficult to imagine a violent strain of apocalyptic christianity rising up as a reaction to that saudi arabia easily proves that wrong extremely high wealth but its one of the if not the shittiest muslim country to live onthe common denominator between all countries where muslim extremism prospers is lack of secularism not wealtheducation of course its important but thats necessarily tied with state secularism saudi arabia have many rich schools and universities but those have maps with israel erased out of course secularism is important what i was trying to say is that it needs to be reinforced throughout the whole society  a government that is nominally secular but that rules over a society filled with ignorance and fundamentalism is not much good i am not sure how else you get there except through education modernity and a decent standard of living gtsaudi arabia easily proves that wrong extremely high wealththats somewhat concentrated in the royal family though isnt it whats the inequality like there horrible inequality i think uae is a perfect counterpoint they have a relatively wealthy populace and low violence despite high levels of religiosity the common denominator is poverty among violent countries this holds true right down to the neighborhood level money gives people a reason to maintain  saudi arabia is unequal uae is a counterpoint to yours high median income and low violence despite high islamic belief its poverty high poverty and poor conditions equals high violence plain and simple this is true whether youre looking at a country or a neighborhood  mine too excellent article and in the places it hasnt been leashed they still kill in the name of god   had the privilege of living with and talking to many of those affected by the lra in gulu regretfully theyre all still staunchly christian despite the events because they dont recognise that christianity played a part in the deaths of their friends and family they just see it as a civil war and every day we have to fight to keep it on the fucking leash as it tries to break back into the school systems into the courts into law and politics christianity is losing ground in the west islam is gaining power elsewhere perhaps in the west as well im sure you could argue i cant help but wonder how much secularism was helped ahead in europe by the fact that the catholic church was a distinct political entity from the various european kingdoms compared to how in islam the caliph is a combined religious and secular leader up until the enlightenment the pope was as much a secular as religious leader its only been in recent times comparatively speaking that the church has been treated as a primarily religious organization although they still spend a lot of money trying to sway elections and political leaders my point exactly european kings had the pope sticking his finger in their pie so no wonder they paid attention when someone started talking about separating church and state not really monarchs relied very heavily on the concept of divine right for the legitimacy of their rules there is some truth in your statement if we apply it to the rise of protestantism  the way the pope used to rule isnt that different from how the caliph rules today the difference is that the religious conservatives have a tighter hold over nations at present and so long as they can convince their people that the west is a dire threat to them theyll be able to maintain it the indiscriminate bombing weve been doing among muslim communities in search of terrorists isnt helping disabuse them of that notion amazing its almost like killing peoples friends families and neighbors is pushing them into the open and waiting arms of religious fundamentalistsseriously though i wish more people understood this no dude they hate our freedom people do understand this but bombs and guns cost money money that someone wants to make i think its clear that the bombings arent effective enough if ive learnt anything from game of thrones its leave no survivors the dead cant harm you yeah they paid attention by burning that person at the stake when you start talking about a separation of church and state you start towards questioning who should be in charge of that state  this comment showed your lack of understanding of islamic history first and foremost caliphs actually became nominal rulers as early as th century they got slapped around poked their eyes out killed and stabbed other people were ruling including and not limited to buyids seljuqs and khawarizms even during the ottomans the religious affairs were directed by separate people for muslims they had the shaykh alislam the orthodox christians they had the ecumenical patriarch of constantinople and the jews had the hakham bashi it is interesting because the division was religious not your ethnic background this was before nationalism while i like the article i dont quite understand what it postulates  how exactly does secularism stop radical islam  its not exactly something you could export  i dont see how sitting on your hands and blindly hoping isis will become secular solves anything western societies that currently uphold secularism should continue to do so even for muslim communities that immigrate do not turn a blind eye toward internal conflicts this isnt really a problem but the political right likes to accuse us of being soft on muslims and tolerating sharia lawfor muslim countries we need to tackle the problem like police more than armies targeting muslim communities with drone attacks may be killing some terrorists but its terrorizing the communities even more we need intelligence work to identify and capture the extremists not shock and aweif muslim communities see that were interested in protecting them as much as ourselves well have a much easier time accomplishing our goals as for isis thats a problem thats going to require an international solution and so long as we present ourselves as a military threat rather than people seeking justice were not going to make much progress take a common immigration country like germany then apply laws that actually make integration work not like in its current state currently a sizeable number of immigrants do not speak the language do not understand you do not want to understand your countrys values and that you cant just commit honour killings because your  year old sister has a german boyfriend    you need to stop the uprising of ghettos everybody has to pull their weight germany has a very difficult history and so everyone seems to be extra careful around foreigners my gf worked in the department for illegal immigration she was able to send  cases away last yearthree it is incredibly hard to get rid of illegal immigrants that may sound harsh but if you live in a country like germany cant understand anybody just stick to your fellow immigrant friends beat your wife and kids and hate western values then for fucks sake why are you here    this is a problem of this secularism many immigrants from the middle east possibly dont get the concept and want to apply their religious laws over the states laws    to stop radical islam you have to support those muslims and other people who are actively against the radicalisation of islam work with them to find new ways to make things work better you can only win against isis if you fight together with the muslim countriesnot just on a military basis what isis currently does is incite hate and violence versus all muslims whether they are integrated or not what is needed is for the enlightenment to spread into the muslim world there are people like ibn warraq who has dedicated his whole career to doing that i do wonder though to what extent the enlightenment can be spread that way it was very much a product of a set of social political and economic circumstances that might be hard to replicate elsewhere not to mention things like cultural factors  what you absolutely can export the separation of religious institutions from government same as any other democrat ideals that have been exported throughout human historythere are thousands of examples of how when you mix religion with government you get poor resultsgti dont see how sitting on your hands and blindly hoping isis will become secular solves anythingno one is suggesting this at all im not sure where you got this from of course secularismthanks for the info good article but the suggestion to just go arrest them is pretty fucking daft  what you think im suggesting we put on sheriffs star badges and ride in on ponies seriously give me a break if we can break in to osama bin ladens compound to kill him we can take him prisoner as well that we didnt speaks more about our priorities than anything else pakistan an ally close to numerous air bases in afghanistan good luck doing that shit in the middle of a tribal region in the heart yemen or in raqqa if you seriously think its just that easy then youre fucking deluding yourself the raid on bin ladens compound had months and months of planning and even then why do you think it was such a hard call to make because its a ridiculously difficult mission to pull off its not fucking easy to drop off and extract a team from the middle of nowhere and its even more difficult to extract them with who knows how many prisoners not to mention theyre not exactly gonna go willingly and in many situations the forces going in are heavily outnumbered which would inevitably lead to causalitiesthe us military is strong but it isnt some invulnerable juggernaut that can do whatever the fuck it pleases at whatever time in every single corner of the globe   great essay excellent bookmarked for later referencethanks  this the solution is the one that ibn warraq  the apostatetoendallapostates from islam  has been telling us all along to spread the enlightenment to the muslim world textual criticism of the bible beginning with spinoza who shocked europe by writing a book which said that the bible was manmade helped set the enlightenment in motionthe criticism of the quran and the hadith which recount the sayings and acions of the prophet demonstrating their manmade nature has already been done extensively its just that this criticism is silenced in the muslim world we need to print up the critical books and just air drop them into the big cities of the muslim world i like the idea of dropping books first of all i respect your opinion but ibn warraq daaaaamn so you are taking an advice from an islamophobe who is sheer existence is to defame islamhow can you employ those same things to a different culture from europe to middle east a common sense would see the turmoil of many dictators lack of education extremely poverty and huge instability in the region helped shaped the fundamentalist extremism modern extremism is actually new like th century newyou need to read robert dreyfuss who is a foreign policy and defense writer for the nation magazine he wrote a good book called how the united states helped unleash fundamentalist islamdo you know who ruled saudi before alsaud family before the big old money hexag offered a potential solution you criticized his solution without offering of your own id like to hear your solution it wasnt clear i implied my solution if you have a stable enviroment a healthy middle class and a functioning economy with stable government you are less likely to succumb into violent attitudeshexag just visited a guy who is a false authority on the matter except none of the muslim nations have been able to pull this off independently or with outside help they are shitholes that wallow in their ignorance whether this is what the common people desire or not is irrelevant as they are never in the position to bring about any meaningful change the two forms of government that seem to thrive where islam is most prevalent are either dictatorships or theocracies you mean predominately muslim countries your comment indicates your true bias against muslims and lack of awareness of middle eastern problems like saddam and the many goons around him give a shit about islam they were promoting arab nationalism and violence is one way they dealt with dissents not to mention the friendliness of western nations with these various dictators yeah you need to recheckonly iran middle east and pakistan south east asia have sort of a connection of being an islamic government especially pakistan was solely created for that reason but now they are notthe last time the middle east in which it was truly in peace was during the pax ottomana in the th and th century saying the ottoman empire was a good government is about as factual as saying the roman empire was they were not there is no one worth supporting or agreeing with in the middle east in my opinion there is simply the completely cynical and bleak reality that we stand to lose less by supporting one violent regime over othersas for my bias against muslims im going to just come outright and say im an antitheist the organization around religious screeds is what is truly dangerous not the religious screeds themselves however islam is not a religion of peace neither is christianity or judaismpeople choose to have faith or choose not to unless it is forced upon them and religious individuals disproportionately push their dogma on the youth in comparison to the godless so you know what yes islam like most religions is not the direct cause of violence or corruptio nor misery but it sure as hell enables it more easily gt it wasnt clear i implied my solution if you have a stable enviroment a healthy middle class and a functioning economy with stable government you are less likely to succumb into violent attitudesim afraid that this is not true it is a seductive illusion a comforting storyafter having argued online about the problem of terrorism in the name of islam there are other kinds of terrorism done by other ideologies i have come to understand that a whole swath of the planet  muslim and nonmuslim alike  is in total denial about the cause of islamic terrorism good muslim people look at moral disasters committed by muslims like the slaughter of the yezidis or the torturous immolation of the jordanian pilot and they tell themselves comforting stories likegt these savages they have no religiongt these savages they arent really muslimgt these savages they are just using islam as a tool to do other thingsgt these savages their savagery has nothing to do with islam its just a product of economic and political andor economic circumstances etcgt etcthese claims appear to many muslim people to be true but upon inspection they turn out to be fictions they are comforting illusions that muslim people and many western liberal types tell themselves so that they dont have to confront just how terrible their deeply cherished beliefs really are muslim people believe that the quran is the perfect word of god that islam is a perfect godgiven system of life that contains the perfect answer to all questions of human lifebecause they believe these things  which are all actually false  and because they love their god and cherish their faith when they see the terrible evils being done in its name they tell themselves all types of stories so that they dont have to change their minds about their religionsmany of my fellow liberals also engage in this kind of comforting storytelling  terrorism is really caused by insert comforting illusion herebut the reality is that the terrorism done in the name of islam is caused by islamic doctrines of jihad martyrdom etc islam is sectarian in a way that other religions are not hatred for the infidel is whitehot in islamgthexag just visited a guy who is a false authority on the matterwell i dont really think of ibn warraq as an authority but he is a fine scholar who has written many fine books by the way have you read his books i have read several of them and they are very well done he has received high praise from some very serious scholars on islam including david cook author of studies in muslim apolyptic and understanding jihadgtdr david cook professor in religious studies at rice university texasgtas a scholar of islam myself i find ibn warraqs attitude to be very refreshing and his scholarship for the most part to be accurate and devastating in pinpointing weaknesses in muslim orthodoxy his third essay some aspects of the history of koran criticism  ce to  ce could almost serve as a history of our field and of its systematic failure to critique the foundational texts of islam as those of other faiths have been critiqued it is an embarrassment for islamic studies that no critical text of the quran has been produced however even were this basic elemental work done there would be still a great more to be done in order to counter one of the most fundamental muslim presuppositionsnamely that the text of the quran has remained absolutely unaltered since the time of the prophet muhammad in the seventh century of the common era ibn warraq counters this nonsense which one hears on a regular basis even from educated muslims who should know better by demonstrating the prevalence of variant readings of the quranic text that the existence of these variants known as qiraat demonstrates the falsity of the orthodox muslim position vis vis the quran is obvious and yet bizarrely rejected even by mainstream scholarsunderstandably muslim people of whom warraq used to be one having grown up in an indianmuslim family in karachi pakistan dont like what warraq has to say they shouldnt rule him out warraqs scholarship shows beyond any doubt the manmade nature of islamif you want to have a look at his books you can get some of them for free here gt im afraid that this is not true it is a seductive illusion a comforting storyhow is it a comforting story that was actually a solution in an unstable enviroment reached by logical conclusion how are people functioning in society are likely to commit any form of crimesgtafter having argued online about the problem of terrorism in the name of islam there are other kinds of terrorism done by other ideologies i have come to understand that a whole swath of the planet  muslim and nonmuslim alike  is in total denial about the cause of islamic terrorism not only do you exaggerate but you are completely writing a false statementgtgood muslim people look at moral disasters committed by muslims like the slaughter of the yezidis or the torturous immolation of the jordanian pilot and they tell themselves comforting stories likewait a minute so you know what every muslim things about hahah and then say good muslims to differentiated between the socalled bad muslims and good muslims like you care im baffled first of all another false statement because muslims dont share collective consciousnessgtthese claims appear to many muslim people to be true but upon inspection they turn out to be fictions another false statement with no basis but only from your own words saying the word many doesnt help your argument in fact it shows how exaggerate muslimsgtthese savages they have no religiongtthese savages they arent really muslimgtthese savages they are just using islam as a tool to do other thingsgtthese savages their savagery has nothing to do with islam its just a product of economic and political andor economic circumstances etcgtetcwhich muslims said that you brought no

thisthis was no comforting story it was reality what i posted you are just throwing all my points out if you have a functioning government there would be as much terrorism as now you didnt even look at the history before the rise of islamic fundamentalism that is one of the many indication in which the period was actually more peaceful than today th and th century middle east was no war zone stable rulers were everywheregtmany of my fellow liberals also engage in this kind of comforting storytelling  terrorism is really caused by insert comforting illusion heregtbut the reality is that

friends are wise and intelligent they focus on multiple problems that arise while you only one they show sign of intelligence and i would like to meet them if they have reddit account and maybe spark a discussiongtwell i dont really think of ibn warraq as an authority but he is a fine scholar who has written many fine bookson what are you comparing national security advisers and foreign police people are not goodsorry i feel incredibly bad for you in fact i would have respected you more as human being if you only had done your research by yourself instead you go to islamophobic website which only fuels your antiislamic views so im trying to understand why you love ibn warraq so much when there are countless people with degrees in foreign policy and islamic studies and middle eastern expertyour basing your opinion on only one man here and probably many who act like him so you dont endeavor on the other side of the coin like a true atheist would have donegthe has received high praise from some very serious scholars on islam including david cook author of studies in muslim apolyptic and understanding jihadso another person demonizing islam boy you are one good fellagtthat the existence of these variants known as qiraat demonstrates the falsity of the orthodox muslim position vis vis the quran is obvious and yet bizarrely rejected even by mainstream scholarsfail huge fail qiraat is just reading not an alteration of variant of the quranjesus h christ lord have mercy on usgtunderstandably muslim people of whom warraq used to be one having grown up in an indianmuslim family in karachi pakistan dont like what warraq has to say they shouldnt rule him out warraqs scholarship shows beyond any doubt the manmade nature of islamif you come to my library you will see many books  or more my hobby is collection books actually it ranges from linux linear algebra islam history roman and i have antiislamic books i like to read both views with a clear openminded brain that is what researcher is suppose to do sorry man but ibn warraqs scholarship is not to be compared to great men who came before him who devoted their lives int his matter since coming from their mothers womb this is funnynot only that you recommend me to go to an exmuslim subreddit so clearly everything there is an antimuslim that is me being a an proroman historian while you be a propersian history and invites me only to collect antiroman books what makes you think that is smarthopefully his the holly flying spaghetti monster can give you an added health and long live gt how is it a comforting storysigh ive had this conversation online with so many times now that i cannot continue make the argument every time because it inevitably involves writing a huge amount i cannot spend the time to write an entire book to every muslim online who is desperate to believe that the bloody madness which is burning it way across the world right now is caused by something besides islamic religious belief so i am going to say what i have to say and leave it at thatthe first thing that you have to understand is that you are operating under an emotional need you for whatever reason are desperate to believe that the terrorism that is happening right now and has been happening for years is caused by something  anything besides islam so your mind is searching for explanations that might point the blame for the mayhem elswhere  economics politics something like that there are articles making this claim but unfortunately their arguments are full of holes big enough to fly a boeing through in case you think i am motivated by prejudice or belief in another religion im an atheist i am not furthermore there are many people from the muslim world  believers and apostates  who say the same as i do islamic doctrine is the primary cause of terrorism committed by muslims in the name of islam here is ali rizvi rizvi was born in pakistan and grew up in saudi arabia and libya he was raised as a muslim but left the faith read what he has to saygtnot only do you exaggerate but you are completely writing a false statementim not exaggerating and my statement is not false in fact your reply is just another example of the total denial that i have described above notice that you dont actually provide any evidence against what i have said if you want to see the evidence for the state of denial that i point out above try reading the articles that get published after a terrorist attack hundreds of such apologetic articles appear after every terrorist attack muslim writers are in total denial about what is being taught in their mosquesgtwait a minute so you know what every muslim things aboutwhere did i say that i know what ever muslim thinks about i made no such claim i challenge you to offer a quote to prove it at no point did i claim to know what every muslim thinks aboutthe rest of your reply above is just more timewasting bickeringgt which muslims said that you brought no evidence to your table you did in a comment above mate gthow can you employ those same things to a different culture from europe to middle east a common sense would see the turmoil of many dictators lack of education extremely poverty and huge instability in the region helped shaped the fundamentalist extremism what you are saying here is that the dictators lack of education etc helped shape the fundamentalist extremismwhile this is true the problem with focusing on these is that fundamentalist extremism has a very strong grounding in the fundamental beliefs of islam jihad against the infidel however freely defined is considered to be a religious dutyfor muslimsand come to think of it werent the prophet muhammad and the caliphs that followed him also dictators of a similar kind thats the truth after all the prophet muhammad and the caliphs that followed him were the saddam husseins the colonel qaddafis of their day a cruel tyrants that ruled over a violent empire the religion of islam is the ideology that emerged during the days of the caliphate  the ideology of a violent expansionist empire and it shows some christians are just as bad as muslims today too uganda especially they do some awful things to homosexuals because of what the bible sayschristians in st world countries have adapted the secular dynamic morality of the enlightenment but other christians are just as barbaric as muslims gt uganda especially they do some awful things to homosexuals because of what the bible says christians in st world countries have adapted the secular dynamic morality of the enlightenment but other christians are just as barbaric as muslimseven more to the point they wrote those laws on the urging of christian leaders from the us which tells you how those leaders think the us should be run seems to imply to me that christianity and islam are both violence promoting mythologies with the major difference being that many christians are just bad christians but too many muslims are still good muslims good and bad referring to how closely adherents follow their scriptures youre close why theyre good or bad under your criteria has a great deal to do with what rules they live under and consequently what expectations they have if they follow or dont follow those rulesmuslims can get away with being good muslims because theyre not subject to the same penalties that apply to good christians in the western world when we compare good muslims to good christians in nonsecular parts of the world there really isnt much practical difference beyond the methods they use a prime example of that is how people always point out only muslims want to kill people for not believing in their ways despite the fact that the bible talks about killing apostates and those that turn from their

witch the foundation of violence and the level of promotion of said violence differs fundamentally from the christian and islamic doctrines im assuming you havent read either if youre quoting bible verses out of context like thatgtyoull hear excuses such as well thats the ot or you have to understand the context or that only applied to israelites so on and so forth same atrocities different daysnot sure why you see them as excuses instead of reasons a doctrinal difference between christianity and islam is that in christianity the doctrines fundamental principles of peace and selfless love resists the more primitive and barbaric scriptures but with islam anything in the doctrine that promotes peace is later abrogated by the conversion by sword principlesyou can point to the bad bible verses all day long but will just be met with some new testament abrogation of those verses its the other way around for islam thats a dangerous and significant differencebasically you can use the christian doctrine to decouple violence from christian religious principles you can not use islamic doctrine to decouple violence from islamic religious principles just because these two religions have both promoted violence from its followers does not mean they are both analogous in relation to their philosophy on aggressive behavior christian doctrine contains a leash on the violence in the new testament islamic doctrine has no leash on its violence other than the sandburying reaction of the individual muslim and their comprehension of their own holy scripture gtjust because these two religions have both promoted violence from its followers does not mean they are both analogous in relation to their philosophy on aggressive behavior  thats my point  regardless of how a much a religion promotes peace followers can easily find justification for horrendous acts  just as any call for violence can be explained away as an issue of contextinterpretation you say that you cannot use islamic doctrine to decouple violence from their principles but ive seen quite a few islamic scholars say that abrogation doesnt always apply or applies differently depending on the situationbookverseanything can be explained away or ignored when its about a persons faithgtim assuming you havent read either if youre quoting bible verses out of context like that  interesting you sound just like my friend  years ago when he said i couldnt possibly understand what the scripture meant because i wasnt a christian just like a multitude of other individuals ive encountered throughout my years attending various churches and groups they always say the same thing yet are invariably guilty of the same  using verses out of context ignoring the context altogether to suit their needs or inferring divine laws that are never touched up in detail or even referenced in the slightest for that mattergood times i agree judaism is doctrinally worse than islam jews celebrate the genocide of unbelievers in many passages of their torah and the genocide of unbelievers isnt celebrated in the koran huhhebrews and ezekiel are from the christian nt bible unless im missing something then i would be grateful like it if someone could explain where i erred  my sentiments exactly they cant execute their atrocious agendas here in the us so they find another avenue deleted deleted i dont disagree with you and i didnt mean to imply that no christians commit violence in the name of the religion today  i just think it intellectually misleading if one thinks that the events happening in africa compares to the events happening due to radical islam the real issue that im concerned is challenging religious ideology specifically the bad aspects blasphemy laws penalty for apostasy atrocities against people who are gay etc today the vast majority carrying out the death penalty  for violating these religious rules or support this ideology are people who are subscribe to islam  with that being said the violence committed by christians today also need to be reported and spoke out against as well regardless if it appears to be less prevalent  gti just think it intellectually misleading if one thinks that the events happening in africa compares to the events happening due to radical islam why the lords resistance army is pretty much indistinguishable from isis in terms of viciousness but i get your point about scale  im ignorant to the acts of the lords of resistance so i need to do additional research yes i think scale is important which people seem to not acknowledge   the scale is genocide how is it intellectually misleading to point to christian religious violence in uganda and elsewherewhen there are extreme social conflicts alongside desperate poverty there will also be violence often that violence will be carried out under the banner of religion its not as if specific doctrines are all that important to causing the violence whats important is that the impulse to violence already exists and religion is one way of mobilizing peoplethe huge mistake people like sam harris and bill maher make is in not interesting themselves with the social and political situation in the middle east which makes them largely unfamiliar with the conflicts theyre looking at they see people using religion to justify violence and think the doctrines of the religion must be causing the violence but there are real social and political conflicts that are playing out in the middle east and elsewhere and you have to understand them if you want to understand the origin of the violent conflicts going on in similarly turbulent and poor regions of the world other religions  christianity and buddhism in particular  serve as the focal point for similarly horrific violence yes yes its not only religion the cause violence agree its poverty politics lack of resources etc what religious doctrine and this case islam allows justifiable death sentences to be carried out insulting the prophet blasphemy death apostate death infidel death today a millions of muslims either commit support or agree with this ideology and tens of thousands of people have died in the last  years christianity also condemns blasphemers adulteres homosexuals and a hundred other classes of people to death the laws of the old testament are incredibly harsh and jesus says explicitly in matthew that those laws still hold details of islamic doctrine have really nothing to do with why theres violence in the middle east as little as details of christian doctrine are the core reason for violence in uganda of course the doctrine of christianity says the same thing the large majority of modern day christians especially in secular nations dont act on or actively support  those violent passages as millions of modern day muslims do today the difference is that terrorism is completely unattractive to better educated wealthier people of any religion in more stable societies without the same enormous social and political tensions that exist in much of the third world in predominantly christian countries that are poor and politically unstable there is also extreme religiously tinged violence in the central african republic and uganda christian groups have invoked their religion to justify mass slaughter of muslims the kidnapping of children to fight as soldiers and a thousand other terrible acts of course there is a concrete political background to this violence and claiming it has to do with details of doctrine as many people want to do would be incredibly naivein general reading this thread its as if most of the posters want to ignore the incredible amount of violence western nations have engaged in in the middle east in order to further their own agendas many posters here see violence committed by muslims and jump on it because its another opportunity to attack religion but the entire background the invasion of iraq by the united states the deliberate destabilization of libya and syria in order to topple governments unfriendly to the west the significant support given by the united states throughout the s to radical sunni fundamentalists as a counterweight to the soviet union and arab secular nationalism  its as if none of that exists as if it can all be ignored and we can just pretend the middle east is in the situation its in right now because of some lines picked out of the hadiththats the problem here its possible to be atheist but to also be educated about history and politics and not to try to boil everything down to passages you dont like in various holy books as pleasing as that might be and while its repugnant do you notice that you have to go search the dregs of the world to find christians committing such violence in the muslim world it is not only common but the very basis of law in many countries and we invite their delegates to come visit us in luxury and treat with us to imply the two groups are generally equivalent is being seriously disingenuous  sure theres just less of them but how are their actions any different  both still commit atrocious acts they dont question their own actions and beliefs to cause harm to another person in the name of christ allah harry potter is all equally messed up gtsure theres just less of them but how are their actions any differenttheyre different because of their motive the christians today committing violence on that bad of a scale are the christians who arent interpreting their own doctrine coherently and following pseudochristian principleswhereas the muslims today committing violence on that bad of a scale are the ones who are actually taking the quran seriously and doing what it says christianity has scripture in its doctrine to resist the promotion of violence islam does notgt both still commit atrocious actson completely different volumes and on completely different levels of promotion you want to understand this distinctiongtthey dont question their own actions and beliefsthe murdering christians dont question their actions and beliefs which is why theyre motivated towards violence from a religion of which promotes inhibition of such actionthe murdering muslims are questioning their actions and beliefs so much so that they get the answers they need straight from their religious doctrine and clearly end up the way that islam intends its followers to behavegtto cause harm to another person in the name of christ allah harry potter is all equally messed upits all bad but one source is much more explicitly influential than the other and thats an objective fact that many even here are in denial to people dont take my word for this study both doctrines study their principles study them chronologically and then begin gaining confidence behind your opinions only then theres so much misinformation along with red herrings flying around these issues that it can become incredibly complicated to parse honestly the middle eastern nations are basically just a step up from most african nations in terms of overall prosperity and economic strength so the middle east could be considered part of the dregs of the world the main difference has been oil and the fact that arab nations didnt just let western nations take all the access to itwhen you start looking at the slightlyless crappy nations like turkey and indonesia it starts getting slightly better far from ideal of course because both indonesia and turkey pull some backwards shit but better nonetheless turkey is mostly secular for example saudi arabia is an unusual circumstance they are essentially being elevated by their oil alone societally theyre still quite restricted and backwards their only really strong point is their economy which again is because of the oil this is why saudi arabia will transform back into a backwards shithole once the oil revenue dries up unless they make some significant changes and create economic sectors that are selfsufficient and could replace oil revenues when needed but you are pretty much doing the same with muslims outside of middle east and africa  muslims arent murdering people sure there were few instances of terrorist attacks here and there but those people are mostly trained in those shithole  you will also find random murders of gays by christians most likely fueled by religious views problem is that in countries that are run by theocracy or broken governments crazy fundies will have ability to act upon their religious views and get away with murder in highly secular countries we are governed by laws where such crimes are punishable so they dont brake them  gt muslim violence has claimed the lives of around  million peoplewhile violence by christians claimed the lives of close to  million people  million compared to  million isnt equivalent youre absolutely right see what youre missing is its a medieval mindset versus a modern one not about which religion has done more cumulative damage the crusades ended hundreds years ago much of the muslim world however has not advanced since then  the american invasion of iraq was just over a decade ago it took the lives of hundreds of thousands of iraqis before you go on about how the other people are savages you should consider how western nations behave in the world and how so many people barely bat an eyelid about their country killing savages abroad youre the only one talking about savages here but since the invasion of iraq was neither about installing christianity nor eradicating islam youve just introduced a red herring  the iraq war had every bit as much to do with christianity as terrorism has to do with islam neither is caused by religion but in both cases many people who support them rationalize their position in religious terms if iraq werent a muslimmajority country and the us a christianmajority country bushs demonization of iraq would not have been so effective many americans saw the war in religious terms as good christian americans doing battle against evil muslim savages take a guy like chris kyle who was motivated partly by his religion to go to iraq on multiple tours and rack up a kill count of  people or take all the conservative political figures in the us who framed the war on terror in religious terms do you recall ann coulters remark about invading the middle east and converting it to christianityof course the iraq war was motivated by economic and strategic considerations but a lot of support for it in the us was religiously motivated terrorism in the middle east also revolves around real issues like the palestinian desire for freedom from israeli occupation but its also cloaked in something people can identify with religionfinally im not pulling savages out of the aether its the way many of the commenters in this thread talk about people in the middle east and its disgusting to read theres plenty of current and recent violence instigated by christians both in the name of religion and using religion as a motivator the article op linked talked about it just curious do you consider europe to be the dregs of africa were not talking world wars here just look at whats happened in the last  years the article had plenty of references i came here to say the same thing i dont think i could have said it so well though penn gillette was just speaking of this on his podcast he spoke on how much more he respected christians after how he called them out on his program called bullshit paraphrasing why he said he did not denounce islam like he did the other religions he plainly stated that he felt he was chickenshit and was afraid for himself and his children there was only one serious death threat for calling the mother theresa a fucking cunt and lots of thank you emails for making them rethink how they were doing things i dont think islam would have done the same i see people asking how we can make islam change to become more like modern christianity  that kind of thought is like saying we should take away a psychopaths gun and hand him a machete instead if we can teach them that maybe we can go a step farther and convince them there are no gods instead go to northern africa and you see christian violence alive and wellwhether its children being stoned to death for being witches or gay people being subject to summary execution or the abuse people subject each other to in the name of catholicism in the philippines another very good example yes exactly this whole christians did bad things too is just liberal cognitive dissonance they want to support muslims because they are a minority that the christian conservative right wing likes to target but in doing so they become apologists for an even more backwards regressive and misogynist ideology  either way the quote that has spurred this discussion is grossly misconstrued all obama said was dont throw stones in glass houses and not to let the extremist represent the religion over all his point was exactly that people could use the klan or the inquisition to represent christianity but they would be wrong to do so except muslims account for the largest religion in the worldtheres that massive hole in your incredibly narrow minded argumentmy motive for pointing out that christians did bad things is simply because i cant stand double standards and hypocrites rather than hating on extremist groups things have started to expand to the entire religion itself even though many muslims are willing to coexisteven the quran has passages about living in harmony with christiansi think isis and other extremist groups are horriblebut relating them to muslims is like relating the westboro baptist church to christiansalsoim not liberal nor conservative im all over the place because i read unbiased news with an open mind and come up with my own opinions as best as i can i would suggest anyone who feels that a single party encompasses their beliefs to reexamine how they where their opinions stem from i think he meant theyre a minority in the west europe north america japan australia etc and conservative rightwing types do like using those minority populations as scapegoats gteven the quran has passages about living in harmony with christianswhich are later abrogated by the scriptures promotion of conversion by sword you realize mohammed was a warlord and that the islamic fundamental principles dont actually promote productive peace right it promotes peace alright but its not the kind of peace any nonmuslim would agree togti think isis and other extremist groups are horriblebut relating them to muslims is like relating the westboro baptist church to christiansyour ignorance to islamic doctrine is overwhelming especially in tandem with your confidence behind your misleading opinions about it followers of isis are about as bona fide muslim as the islamic doctrine permits wbc is not this can be and subsequently is backed up by the actual doctrines behind these religions rather than peoples impressions of these doctrinesgtim all over the place because i read unbiased news with an open mind and come up with my own opinions as best as i canthats great but unfortunately youve evidently become herded into the false impression that the doctrine of islam is somehow on par with the doctrine of christianity in terms of violence promotion this couldnt be further from the truth by the expression of both doctrines there are very specific distinctions that you and many others have overlooked and the burden on you is to correct your presumptions about these theistic complications if youre going to argue that isis represents bona fide islamic doctrine then youre going to have to accept wbcs reading of christianity is bona fide christian doctrine wbc simply insists on applying mosaic laws to the tee despite jesus talk about love and peace he specifically said that he was not overturning a single one of the old lawsand those laws include death for all sorts of minor transgressions against the faith gt alsoim not liberal nor conservative im all over the place because i read unbiased news with an open mind and come up with my own opinions as best as i can i would suggest anyone who feels that a single party encompasses their beliefs to reexamine how they where their opinions stem fromliberal and conservative are philosophies not parties even more so our democrat and gop are focused on getting elected more than theory historically speaking their ideological base has switched im liberal but i dont identity as a democrat your argument might hold weight if the first world countries of the world had some representative population of muslims as your point would suggest instead the countries that are inhabited primarily by muslims are also coincidentally mainly backwards theocracies clinging to archaic forms of rule and discourse  says a holocaust denier leashed bullshit it only looks that way in north america and only if you allow for media bias when a christian does something awful he isnt always called a christian while you tend to hear right away when its a muslim but here is a small sample of recent fun acts of christian inspired violence growing concerns of a genocide by christians against muslims in central african republic american christians funding the killthegays bill in uganda how many gay suicides have we had now because of conversion therapyinvasion of iraq   george bush jr god told me to invade iraqthe last fucking residential school in canada only fucking closed in  for christs sakerwandan genocide in a nation that is  christian serbian ethnic cleansing of bosnians here is a fun list of rightwing conservative christians terrorist attacksobviously there are others like shooting a couple doctors who perform abortionsit is a complete myth that christianity has matured in any way and thats just some that are easy to point to one could also make a more complicated argument that most military actions around the world have strong religious elements most wars by the united states for example enjoy much christian support with christian leadership sometimes as noted above enjoying direct communication and support from god that sounds exactly the same to me as any imam talking to allah about who to bomb  there are a significant number of young christians joining the military here in the us with the express idea that it will give them a license to kill muslims and they relish the opportunityi have witnessed this first hand i have as well it was a prevalent attitude when i was in high school too the classmates of mine that were christian and joining the military did so for religious reasons righteous indignation   gt it s a complete myth that christianity has matured in any waythis exactly  the only thing that has changed is that our society has outlawed many of the things that are directly prescribed by the bible  it is against the law to follow gods command in many situations arent christians killing gay people in africa right now  great comparison  christians in africa are killing tens of thousands of gays and witches just like muslim fundies are killing tens of thousands of apostates blasphemers infidels gays witches and other muslims the christians in africa are killing witches and blasphemers too laughable comparison its amazing people have to go to uganda to identify something remotely comparable to the violence committed by people who believe support or agree with islam and sharia law the sheer numbers are not even close  plus if you did a comparison of christians who think you should kill for blasphemy adultery apostasy etc to the muslims around the world again you wouldnt come close gt christian violence was just as bad as muslim violence todayyeah if you dont count the christian violence that is just as bad today like labeling children witches and burning them alive all lead by the us christian pastors gtafricawell i really dont mean to be racist but you know so a human life is less valuable because its an african life you should work on that because what you just said is hitlerian levels of racismit doesnt matter if you meant its not surprising or its not as bad  both are equally racist and equally offensive theres a whole section of the article titled todays christian violence yea this guy obviously didnt read the whole article the fuck how many people are dead in iraq because god told george fucking bush to invade  hundreds of thousands itll take a loooong time for a two bit terror group like isil to match those numbers gthow many people are dead in iraq because god told george fucking bush to invadeif you think that bushs alleged belief in the christian god is the reasoning behind sending troops to iraq or the middle east in general then youve been mistaken you might be more familiar with the political motives of american leaders but its a very similar story in the middle east if you think belief in allah is the reason for the current turmoil in iraq and syria then youve been mistaken could the same not be said of isil thats it then another no ur wrong on reddit cheney told bush to invade  there was a lot of money to be made and cheney and his cronies are all about the graft george bush has claimed he was on a mission from godwhen he launched the invasions of afghanistan and iraq funny his dad said that too yeah but was that what he actually believed or is it what he thought he needed to say to get a chunk of the population to go along with it oh if god told him then it must be something i can get behind does isil actually believe in the quran or is it what they thought they needed to say to get a chunk of the population to go along with it i suspect there is a bit of bothit is a time honoured tradition for leaders or wannabe leaders to convince the devout in their population that they have the ear of their god are their gods chosen leader divine right of kings or are a god themself ancient egypt rome etc it is hard to believe what some people will believe despite cognitive dissonance remember that muslims are brainwashed on a daily basis more than even the mormons in the us are  muslims are supposed to pray on their knees to the invisible sky fairy five times a day  and if they dont in most countries they risk their livesthe cannot speak their minds  they cant even ask questions without the secret police aka corrupt mullahs on up listening at every turn  so they lie on even anonymous surveys about even the most common sense thingstowing the party line at all timessimply because they have learned not to trust anyonewere talking about populations raised in nations that arent qualitatively different than north korea or the former soviet unionthat kind of brainwashing and fear committed over centuries makes it very hard for the average muslim to grasp even the fundamentals of things like free speech free association and freedom to travel what is the difference if bush was sincere or not it is a holy war either way either he thought god told him or xians believed him either way our brothers and sisters died also their iraq war summaries started with a bible verse hard to deny the connection in one scenario hes a hypocritical  manipulative bastard in the other he is just deludedi agree that he was dangerous  no matter which is true  look how hard you at trying to make this not be religiousyou would not give this much slack to any other religion trying to not make this be religioussure bush was a religious guy no argument therebut that doesnt  mean he couldnt have cynically used that religion to manipulate people hundreds of billions of dollars changed hands  many men became millionaires overnight  they made a killing and thousands of american servicemen and hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilians died for nothing at all even today there are people who think capitalism shouldnt be leashed he might have felt a god told him to invade but lets be fair  the invasion was done under nationalism  i dont think he said according to scripture luke chapter  verse  is says kill all infidels that make fun of the virgin mary  xian violence has for the most part simply become less overt  it still abounds  i say forthe most part because uganda etc  its only less overt in places where it is illegal to directly follow the barbaric laws laid down in the bible  killing people for working on saturday gets you put in prison these days christian violence still exists look at the evangelical christians in uganda who got the government there to start killing gay people in gods name look at the worshipers of christ in russia  who are also murdering gay people look at the pope insisting birth control including basic disease prevention is amoral even if you live in africa and you know your husband has aids that is violence and death as a scale isis can never imagine  this is misleading heres whygtthat is violence and death as a scale isis can never imagineeven if i granted you this as fact it wouldnt compare to the scale of muslim extremism in general its very disingenuous to compare all current murdering christians with just isis when talking about the level of violence being promoted by these two religions really theres nothing too special about isis in regard to islamic doctrine there is however much controversy regarding christian doctrine in relation to christians who are murdering others under abrogated abrahamic doctrinealso and more importantlygtthese days christian violence still exists look at the evangelical christians in uganda who got the government there to start killing gay people in gods namelook at the worshipers of christ in russia  who are also murdering gay peoplelook at the pope insisting birth control including basic disease prevention is amoral even if you live in africa and you know your husband has aidsall these christians are doing this in the name of their misunderstood perception of the christian god theyre cherry picking the violence promotion and theyre neglecting their own religious doctrine when it comes to functional and peaceful behaviorbut isis as well as all the other muslim extremists theyre not misunderstanding anything in islamic doctrine theyre following it down to every collective principle and religious motivation theyre only murdering people because theyre not ignoring the doctrines unabashed aggressive influencethis is quite a significant distinction ive pointed out between the two religions and their corresponding doctrines this is the distinction thats key to understanding in the concern for muslims and islamic influence gt all these christians are doing this in the name of their misunderstood perception of the christian god theyre cherry picking the violence promotion and theyre neglecting their own religious doctrine when it comes to functional and peaceful behaviorgt but isis as well as all the other muslim extremists theyre not misunderstanding anything in islamic doctrine theyre following it down to every collective principle and religious motivation theyre only murdering people because theyre not ignoring the doctrines unabashed aggressive influenceislamic religious source material says many different things on many different subjects many of those pronouncements are in conflict with one another or can be interpreted in several different ways its easy to say that christians who do bad things are just misunderstanding christianity because the true interpretation is something else but its just as easy to say that about islam you can point to a hadith that seems to justify killing nonbelievers and someone else can tell you youre interpreting it too broadly and then point to a passage in the quran that forbids violence as a means of spreading islam its easy to play this game with any religion with a large body of source materialgt really theres nothing too special about isis in regard to islamic doctrineyoure seriously misinformed about this isis has just about the most violent interpretation of islam out there theyre nowhere near the mainstream and most people in the middle east are appalled by their actions and would distance their religion from the religion of isis i dont know where you got the idea that isis has some runofthemill ordinary interpretation of islam but thats most definitely not the case and it shows a massive level of ignorance to believe so didnt bother to read the article i see dear god i thought i was going crazy there for a second i dont understand why there are so many people in this thread arguing over this issue when its clear that they didnt read anything more than the title of ops post the number of ignorant comments with up votes here is too damn high you must not have read the article it specifically discussed current christian violence not yester year the last sentence is the most important evolution our generation needs to go through considering the dates of the creation of islam compared with christianity id say we have another  years to go before we see a watered down version of islam that has its place in western society  i hear what you are saying and without proper reflection i tend to agree with your statement about islam has not had the opportunity to go through the water down process  although because we know more today have the ability to communicate around the world command of resources technology etc the process shouldnt take nearly as long  who am i kidding we are talking about humans where critical thinking empathy promoting health happiness and wellbeing are still a rare tools utilized by the majority i dont think so the pressures that drove the enlightenment we much more established worldwide now as is other technologies that drive secularism and liberalism shouldnt be anywhere near that long christianity isnt watered down  its simply illegal to practice it  accurately  we do not allow people who do not suffer witches live to remain in western society serbian christians were attempting to kill all of the muslims in their country in the s can we not pretend that all xtian violence is in the buried past because they won thats why  not was it still pretty much is today its just not promoted as such answer  functioning governments that have just laws they can upholdthe exact problem with most of the middle east if you want christian violence go to africa plenty of witcheshomosexuals being murdered there  actually it provides insights that will help solve the problem a lot of people believe islam is intrinsically doomed to have radicalviolent extremists due to the innate and violent nature of its passages and scriptures its nice to show people that what was once a book that caused people to do incredibly horrible things the bible can also be a book that is sacredly used by many and doesnt cause violence in another time i think its at least useful in convincing those who believe the problem is inevitable as long as the quran exists we know that there are a lot of moderately practicing nations and we need to somehow bring out that side of the quran in the radicalized nations gt reflecting on the violence of past does nothing to solve the violence that fundamental islam is committing todayno it certainly does work to help solve the violence  understanding how christianity overcame its most barbaric tendencies may help teach how to help islam overcome its barbaric tendencieswhy is that point lost on so many the problem is that today when the usa it europe kill thousands of people we dont blame christianity when any muslim doors any bad thing anywhere we hold every muslim responsible the violent christians in the usa are in prison or dead if people think that just because christians arent lopping off heads in the middle east means that theyve somehow moved past their violent ways are kidding themselves extremely devout christians have within the past few decades attacked abortion clinics with bombs and killed the doctors that work there in the name of jesus not to mention all of the horrible atrocities being committed in africa against homosexuals again done in the name of jesus one of which is called necklacingthere is just something about religion that works people up into such a frenzy that theyre willing to commit horrible atrocities it doesnt matter if youre a christian or a muslim the most extreme of both will kill for their god  no one is pretending that christians havent committed violence approximately how many people have died or killed in the name of christ in the last  years due to abortion clinic bombings and african christians killing homosexuals  first of all lets quit pretending like christian violence doesnt exist anymore   second acting like we can have control over violence that fundamental islam is committing today seems like a waste of time particularly when people are talking about trying to fight fire with fire  that has never workedviolence and poverty breed extremism and the west sure as shit isnt doing anything to eliminate violence or poverty in muslim nations  hell we breed that shit them being unstable is good for business most muslim violence is considerably less about religion and considerably more about fighting perceived postimperialist invaders  we can all jump to examples of lunatics murdering people over drawings all we want but thats aggressively ignoring and denying the fact that violent muslim ideology is built around repelling the forces that they see as holding them down  and lets be honest theyre not exactly wrongyou want to know why christians of today or westerners in general dont commit the atrocities of yesteryear  the answer is real simple we have independent unmolested sovereignty  there arent any random drone strikes blowing up our underfunded schools  no western christian nations are being invaded based on made up bullshit justifications  there arent puppet governments being installed across europe that are overtly controlled by muslims trying to capitalize on european natural resources  the us doesnt have a centuriesold history of unwanted influence and manipulation from middleeastern sources       violent muslim ideology killed  people on  and violent western ideology killed  people in retaliation destabilizing the entire region in the process  and were really supposed to act like we dont know why they hate us    now if you can determine why christians of today dont commit the atrocities of yester year and apply it to fight the violent muslim ideology then you will have somethingoh but they do the us a selfproclaimed christian nation spends a vast majority of its time and wealth waging war on brown people but wait i thought christians loved peacewhy is a christian nation always at war how the fuck is the us a christian nation its secular with separation of church and state it wages wars based on democracy vs non democracy and self interested power pft when has the us respected other countries democracy personally im an atheist no need to get angry unfortunately the us is a christian nation over  of americans identify as christian thats why things are so jacked upthere is no separation of church and state although our constitution aims for just that christians run the showfor now i havent seen christians running much besides their mouth just because a nations people identifies as a majority of something doesnt make it so lots of european countries have a majority christian population too hasnt been a time where ive felt the christian pressure in the us albeit i dont live in the bible beltthey have their own schools and churches good luck trying to pass any religious laws christians hardly run shit the corporations run more than any christian entity i suppose i feel it more because i live in the south in this region religion and christianity by far is king everything revolves around it i often feel trapped but theres not much i can do about that christians control all businesses local and state government here and it will not change for at least another generation ill give you a good beating said the cleric after the innocent child successfully defended itself from the clerics attempt to sexually abuse the child the cleric never got caught since the mistake was never on his side but the system he was caught in he was too stubborn to realise untrue he was too stupid to realise that he himself didnt believe in the positivity of the human nature he was sad that government and church werent so close together as in  years ago he wished he was born in an islamic state where religion and state arent disjunct i post this in connection to what the representative of the christians god said ie pope oh such irony i think its obvious what the problem is  economic development or lack thereof  gtchristian violence was just as bad as muslim violence todayand why was it so violent the religion is identical today the book hasnt changed the conditions in culture society politics have changed that is the reason its not violent today the cause was not just the bible any more than the cause of islamic violence is just the quran or islam came here to say this  job done  fuck ignore wrong post did you read the article extremist christian sects are still committing atrocious acts just not to our people or in our country so at least in the united states we didnt hear about itanyone who would write about it in the states would be written off by the conservative right as attacking christianity unfairly though because religion is something you have to wake up from on your own and they cant take self criticism and change things just due to the nature of how they work gt if you can determine whyi think its simply that islam is the better religion if you would view it as a computer program running on our minds and society islam is just more waterproof less contradictory more expansive and less flexible you cant even leave islam it is simply a matter of degree you can be devout christian and still for democracy or human rights in contrast you cannot be a devout muslim and be for democracy and human rights how about violence in generali dont understand why people just look at it from the religious aspectthats only a percentage of the whole picture hereobama is doing nothing but dividing the nation even more with this statement how about addressing the real source of the problem for once because the topic is not about violence in general  its specifically about violence conducted in the name of islam which i think anyone could agree is a problem today yes other religion are committing atrocities but i think today the vast majority is being conducted in the name of islam  i dont disagree at alljust sick of seeing this and nothing being done about it and no way for me to personally help make a change with all the corrupted still thriving on people who want to make a difference i dont think he was saying that to solve the problem or even to excuse the violence committed by isis he was emphasizing that extremists exist in all shapes and forms and arent limited to one group or sect forgetting this causes unwarranted discrimination and fear towards an overarching group that doesnt deserve it and can even become generational as each generation passes down these fears and hateful sentiments to their children  economic apathy thats why christians of today arent as militant as they used to be muslims are largely still living in an environment in which the primary motivation is acceptance in a small closeknit community a small number of people subscribing to a more militant belief structure that feeds on acceptance and a sense of brotherhood can spread their message much more quickly in that sort of environment without easy access to technology that could allow them to measure their beliefs relative to a larger body of knowledge theyre trapped in an echo chamber in which their guiding motivation is ideological conformityin the us we tend to focus on personal achievement over community acceptance misanthropes who are masters of their craft are admired and material wealth is the goal this is the end result of the puritan work ethic that we started with devoid of its religious messagecombine individualism and materialism with technology and you have generations of people who dont care about the larger community admire disruptive innovators and have access to so much information that skepticism is the default state to be clear here this is not rational reasoned skepticism but the cynical irrational dismissal of new ideas regardless of their truthvalueif we want to defang the more extreme muslim ideologies then we need to change their primary motivations education access to information and the seduction of personal wealth in other wordsin simple eli terms put a mcdonalds on every corner open up a hundred malls provide education and internet access and give it two generations to be clear im not saying their culture is inferior in some vague illdefined way to ours im saying that in our culture we tend to run or walk towards excess obesity aggressive personal promotion and virulent opinion however despite or because of all of our failings ideologies that advocate disruption of the status quo and actual wholesale violence tend to waste away rather quickly here because its a lot of work and those sorts of organizations rarely pay well gt now if you can determine why christians of today dont commit the atrocities of yester year and apply it to fight the violent muslim ideology then you will have somethingthe enlightenment might have something to do with it the article points out that christian violence like the bosnian genocide and the rwanda genocide were far more recent and happened within the last couple decades  when most people talk about christian violence they talk about the crusades and inquisitions that happened centuries ago but there are still wars waged by christians currently in africa as the article points out  i also think its a fair point that some of the world most deadliest wars such as wwi and wwii were perpetrated by nations with christian majority populations and has killed far more people compared to groups like isis sure you totally have a pointprovided you completely ignore the contemporary atrocities committed by african christians anti hindu christians of india and crazy chinese christians  really i dont see how his point doesnt still stand even if you account for all the murdering christians around the globe today the difference between the volume in numbers compared to these religions seems to indicate significance and i think the points being made here come from that significance you said christians of today dont commit the atrocities of yesteryearyoure ignoring the fact that it does happen in large numbers  gt now if you can determine why christians of today dont commit the atrocities of yester yearugandan christians in the st century are still committing atrocities what are you smoking that you think its a thing of the past if theres one thing american sniper shows it is the depth to which self righteous christian bigots will go to defend killing brown people in the name of legal military action the soldiers that went into iraq were engage in imperialist action on par with roman or any ancient civilization conquering force all resistance was met with overwhelming suppressive force just because the us president authorized it doesnt make it any less violent well its largely socioeconomic reasons if you look at impoverished parts of the world you can still find violent groups of christians look at parts of india and africa for example agree didnt mean to imply that its only religion  was as in serbia or rwanda i wasnt aware those atrocities were sooo far in the past  whats the matter downvoter did i hit a little too close for comfort yeah those christians dropping bombs from planes drones etc over there arent violent at all which christians    which christians have organized a coherent christian organization and owned planes and drones and dropped bombs from those planes and drones for the purpose of fulfilling that christian organizations goalsthere is a huge difference between random people who identify as christian within a secular organization dropping bombs and people identify as muslim within a muslim organization who murderbomb on behalf of that muslim organization for the purpose of benefitingexpanding that muslim organization thats the whole point from the perspective of the rest of the world there is no difference  whether perceived or actual the us military is seen as a coherent christian organization who murderbomb on behalf of that organization sorry to burst your bubble but i am in the rest of the world australia and i dont see the us military as a coherent christian organization gtthe us military is seen as a coherent christian organizationyour perception has to be really skewed to see the us military as some religious brigade  your perception has to be really skewed to say there isnt any religious overtone to the us military especially from the perspective of someone in afghanistan iraq pakistan syria somalia etc  this picture is from a forward operating base in afghanistan also read this storyand the comments they have a chapel for christian soldiers whats the issue here  religious overtones what does that even mean im comparing it to a movement with real religious overtones like isis or the crusades someone putting up a cross on a tent means absolutely nothing  if that means absolutely nothing regarding the personnel their outlook or motivations to you then there is nothing to discuss  your head is too far in the sand if you ask mainstream christians if the us military is a christian organization or if the us government is christian or based in christianity they will say yes they push christianity in the military they push it in government they join the military because they want to legally kill muslims not all of them of course but a significant portion and they are in charge of our militaryyou cannot ignore this they are shielded by our secular nature but they believe that they are on an ordained path to wage war by the will of godhere is one articlethere are many on the issue if you cared to search or just ask someone who has been deployed who would be willing to discuss it and theyre wrongi am in the military and yes there is some mandatory prayer crap that continues but realistically there are more nonreligious or agnostics or atheists than there are dominionist christiansand yes there are people who believe theyre holy warriors they are not a dominate majority and they dont really run the show    and when they do show themselves they tend nasty letters from the likes mrff and get reigned inso save that cared to search bullshit because i am actually here first hand experiencethe fact of the matter is we are not a christian nation dropping bombs and yada yada yada    youre trying to equate  very different things for the purpose of promoting a message that is not entirely truthful you mean like the ones running the us government obama isnt a christian    neither are most of the people running the government gtobama isnt a christian    neither are most of the people running the governmentwheres your evidence to support this claim hes a muslim  duh  how could you possibly present evidence about ones inner beliefs  do you think those at the top of any religious hierarchy believe in what theyre selling then why make the claim that theyre not christian it doesnt matter what i think it only matters what they say and what they promote by that standard i have no reason to not believe what they say about their own beliefs  uh     none    no evidence     based on obamas speech he almost always mentions nonbelievers in his speeches especially in the important ones i strongly suspect he is not an christian    as for most of the people that run the government theyre politicians who say what they must to get elected     not christians but merely christiansso no evidence but strong suspicion that they are not actually christian     regardless     very few beyond the fringe claim the us acts for the purpose of or to the benefit of christianity they also claim the us is a christian nation despite the us constitution clearly stating no religious test for public office and no establishment gt based on obamas speech he almost always mentions nonbelievers in his speeches especially in the important ones i strongly suspect he is not an christianhave you heard of confirmation biasgt so no evidence but strong suspicion that they are not actually christian i suspect this post has been raided by trolls what does our suspicion have to do with realitygt very few beyond the fringe claim the us acts for the purpose of or to the benefit of christianity they also claim the us is a christian nation despite the us constitution clearly stating no religious test for public office and no establishmentso youre not aware of the thinly veiled movement to turn the us into a christian theocracy dont take my word for it look it up the republican party is dominated by them gtbased on obamas speech he almost always mentions nonbelievers in his speeches especially in the important ones i strongly suspect he is not an christian  by that logic im an overweight anorexic blackgaylesbiantransgenderbeaglepokemon aborted female fetus from japan  ive really grown as a person i went over there and fought as an atheist so im waiting and you are what they call a useful idiot im not saying that you are either useful or an idiot but the powers that be pretty much look at all of us that way so the people you were working for were also atheist they probably are or dont care about god in the least they just recognize it is a great way to stay in power  and im sure you have evidence to support that claim and im sure you have evidence to support your claim that the war was fought in the name of the christian god more than he offers for his claim that theyre atheists so are you saying that the united states is dropping bombs drones etc is because the bible tells them so the people of us have to drop bombs on people to protect avenge or defend yahweh they commit these acts of violence because they are commanded by their god and doctrine i didnt mean to imply that people who are christian dont commit violence what i was saying that it appears that the acts of violence committed by muslims today are directly attributed to their doctrinealthough i do acknowledge its not only doctrine and commanded by god  of course you have to go to rd world countries for a comparison because  how many gays and witches have been killed in the last  years btw its difficult to identify and compare any religious country or groups st world secular based modern that has committed the atrocities of modern within the last   years day fundamentalism islam i wonder how many military people you know  i have at least two friends that believe they are blessed by jesus to kill muslims  you know there are millions of muslims that arent doing any of that right  you do understand that within the last  years america has a much higher death toll than any single group and is seen by the rest of the world as a christian force  your high horse holds exactly zero credibility killed by a crazy extremist by fire or killed by a drone strike is equally atrocious nope not violent or religious at all i dont think you can blame the military for what gets put on their equipment by when they only just found out i can damned well blame the people who run the military and give them their orders its far more likely that they buy from that manufacturer because theyre the lowest bidderhave best quality for the price than because they sneak bible verses into the serial numbers right im sure it was totally coincidental and a surprise to everyone involved nope totally nonviolent nondenominational slaughter  thats totally over for christians the problem with this article assumes those wars started european powers were religious reasons yes there were devout people involved yes religious figures were used to inspire troops the wars themselves were driven religious regions religion the main reason war europe fell favor the peace westphalia even the yugoslav wars the nineties were driven ethnic tension the differences religions catholic muslim orthodox was fuel to the fire ethnic division to stroke the flames yeah agreed its not fair to count the casaulties of both world wars towards violence brought about by christianity while religion may have been a way to rally the troops it wasnt the main reason for the conflicts and including the holocaust too i wouldnt consider that christian violence either more like institutionalized racism on a genocidal scale im not necessarily disagreeing but it is worth noting that the vatican was conspicuously silent about the holocaust during wwii its not fair to point the finger at them but when time and time again people are invoking violence racism sexism etc in the name of your religion and you dont speak out about it thats pretty damning  does that mean that the islamic leaders who dont speak out against the terrorism that muslims commit are just as bad you mean the holohoax the holocaust is a christian thing well the anti jewish sentiments anyhowyou know with jews supposedly killing jesus and all that even the whole reason why the jews were spread out across europe and the world was entirely religious in the eyes of christianity i think that was the propaganda that got people to go along with it but not the actual reason for the holocaust the jews were a scapegoat for the economic hardships felt by the german people at the time there were far more sociopolitical forces at work than simply religion antisemitism has a long and dark history in europe jews were an easy scapegoat every single time although you might argue that by the time of ww jews were scapegoats because they were always scapegoats instead of being scapegoats because they killed and rejected jesusthat europe agreed to give the jews their own state after ww really wasnt just about the holocaust but because of a long history of anti antisemitism and the fact that it could and probably would happen again sometime in the future just as it has happened before as well although on a smaller scale wasnt it also more jews as a culture were being targeted  not just the jewish religion which is obviously targeted as well but the ethnically jewish as well we christians didnt exactly do our part to dampen antisemitism  people like dietrich bonhoeffer were heroes of posterity but he was definitely in the minority among german protestants a minority amongst german protestants historical revisionism at its best the majority of protestant churches taught loyalty to the state through essentially promoting blatant patriotism gthistorically the german evangelical church viewed itself as one of the pillars of german culture and society with a theologically grounded tradition of loyalty to the state during the s a movement emerged within the german evangelical church called the deutsche christen or german christians the german christians embraced many of the nationalistic and racial aspects of nazi ideology once the nazis came to power this group sought the creation of a national reich church and supported a nazified version of christianity gtafter  the silence of the church leadership and the widespread complicity of ordinary christians compelled leaders of both churches to address issues of guilt and complicity during the holocausta process that continues internationally to this day another interesting read on the subject interesting link  but i think we are in agreement i was trying to say that the confessing church of which bonhoeffer was a member did not make up a majority of evangelical christians in germany oh there were certainly religious people that had a hand in the tragedy but it wasnt one religion trying to destroy another it was a power hungry political party lead by a psychopath who was able to distort public opinion by creating an easy scapegoat for all their failures thus rallying the support of the nationalists it had far more to do with socalled ethnic superiority than it did religion the holocaust was social darwinismnot religion  you could argue that a lot of the islamic fundamentalism is really a front for ethnic and and geopolitical strife too at least at the top but the top assholes arent the ones pulling the trigger its the grunts at the bottom who buy into that religious fervor that go out to kill the unbeliever they dont know or care about the puppet pulling the strings i agree  it feels like a lot of the muslim fundamentalism is a reactionary attempt to distinguish themselves from the west  middle eastern leaders taking extreme measures to avoid being westernized has been a thing for a while nowits kind of like how a lot of the fundamentalist christians in the us seem to be sinking deeper into fundamentalism or at least getting loud about it partly to distinguish themselves from the democratic party  they see it as an us vs them thing and they want to keep their identity as far away from the other side as possible and religion is one of the main ways in which they do so why o why didnt the american government help those that did the arab spring and instead helped those dictators that made people more extremist didnt egypt elect their own extremist leader after arab spring  the us governments not helping things certainly but i dont think theyre the entire problem either that is one example im talking about countless countries from africa latin america and middle east and you are saying egypt the lowest of the fruitsnever said they were problem reread my comment that makes sense when you hear about leaders of extremist organizations who had porn stashes or whathaveyou the extremism is the real purpose the religious motivation is an addon for extra flavor or a mask  its hard to separate where religion ends and geopolitical strife starts but islam certainly provides the base the theological background for these things to take place without its guiding books youd have a lot harder time justifying the taking of sex slaves or killing people for worshiping the wrong version of allah have to disagree on the yugoslav wars as religion is precisely the separating difference between serbs croats and muslim bosnians  ethnically they are the same might have been true if  of the  groups werent the same religion and all  werent completely different ethnic backgrounds  differing sects i think though arent serbians orthodox and croatians catholic yes a reflection of them as completely different ethnic groups  the bosnians again a third separate ethnic group  the notion that this was a religious war is just silly first of all if anyone in this thread bothered to read the article it addresses this exact pointsecondgteven the yugoslav wars of the nineties were primarily driven by ethnic tension the differences in religions catholic muslim orthodox was merely fuel added to the fire of ethnic division to stroke the flamesdifferences in religion didnt add to it it was the source of ethnic divisions ethnically speaking these groups are all indistinguishable save for their religion first off the quote the article used the word was is second off to claim that christianity responsible death than islam this time period the idiotic thing ive this sub there factual basis this statement all ive this thread the fact that there bible verses guns cool the correlation lies the majority the us is christian therefore logically the majority troops christian there causation though there crusades going on no beheaded christian even the troubles ireland which arguably the christian conflict even though was loyalty to the crown independent state caused  deaths  year period   deaths itself in day the problem with your counterpoint is that it assumes that all muslim wars against the west are for religious reasons  the entire middleeast is islamic its a unifying social force in a fractious tribalistic region with ancient divides  if there were no external force seeking to dominate the region for its natural resources there would probably be no isis or al qaeda  except the people in charge of those regions are in control of said resources not external powers the fundamentalists are upset that their leaders get rich doing business with infidels  western powers declare wars and have covert operations to ensure that the people in those regions elect the leaders they want them to elect that explains the difference between how the us treats saudi arabia and how it treats iran gtwestern powers declare wars and have covert operations to ensure that the people in those regions elect the leaders they want them to electas it should be we have a global hegemony to maintain here whether or not thats true is irrelevant to the fact that if those people werent in power groups like the taliban would rule the entire muslim world  not at all during the mid th century most governments in the islamic world were far more westernized following in the mold of ataturk in turkey the radical islam thing is a late th century resurgence beginning in the s with the muslim brotherhood which has gotten progressively stronger  as infidels continue to meddle in the region  also they spend a lot of time and effort hurting oppressing and killing eachother geopolitics might go some way toward explaining the grievance that fundamentalist muslims have against the west but if it were all just politics and economics how exactly are we to make sense of the behavior like that of the gangs of pious muslims in baghdad who are running around supergluing gay mens anuses shut and force feeding them petrol or the enraged husbands and fathers so offended by the most trivial of indiscretions by the women and girls in their lives that theyll routinely throw acid into their faces for doing things like learning how to readthis kind of pc hand washing is almost enough to sicken me in accepting the masochistic burden of responsibility for all the ill will received from religious nutjobs and murderers abroad were essentially saying to every oppressed woman and child and freethinker and homosexual living under islamic theocracy sorry guys but we feel bad for fucking up so youre all on your own now gt first off the quote in the article used the word was not is second off to claim that christianity is responsible for more death than islam in this time period may be the most idiotic thing ive seen on this sub goddamit ratheismim agreeing with ucablenewspundit the vietnamese war alone resulted in     vietnamese service members and civilians killed some  cambodians and  laotians since that war had exactly zero to do with religion your point is i think hes saying that because islam is the central social force in the middle east everything that comes out of there is blamed on islam and in america the central social force is christianity so if the same standard is applied to everyone then the vietnam war should be blamed on christianity could be wrong though  gt first off the quote in the article used the word was not isi used a firefox extension called shareaholic i apologize that i didnt proofread the title it offered carefully enoughgt second off to claim that christianity is responsible for more death than islam in this time period may be the most idiotic thing ive seen on this sub there is no factual basis for this statementother than you know the evidence but why let facts get in the way of a cherished rhetoricgt all ive seen so far in this thread is the fact that there are bible verses on guns cool the correlation lies because the majority of the us is christian therefore logically the majority of our troops are christianyou might have a point there if that was a claim that had been made whether or not the troops are christian is not relevant whether or not the nation is composed of christians is not relevant the fact that the people driving this war are christian and are promoting a christian agenda is its no secret that evangelism has been and still is a problem in the us militaryand its being tolerated at the highest levels of government hell half of our dominant political parties consider it a necessity and argue that secularism is unamericangt there are no crusades going ondebatablegt no one is being beheaded for not being christianthe fact that they dont use the same tactics doesnt mean they dont existgt even the troubles in ireland which is arguably the most recent christian conflict even though it was more about loyalty to the crown and an independent state caused  deaths in a  year period  alone had  deaths in itself in one daythats a tight little bubble you live in you should expand your search gt other than you know the evidence but why let facts get in the way of a cherished rhetoricexcept that there isnt really any in the article christian wars are different from wars fought by christians just as muslim wars are different from wars fought by muslims to call either world war a christian war or to credit christianity with them is idiotic its almost like we havent been discussing the evidence throughout this thread the evidence you provided still does not back up your claim in the statistics of your source latinos are the biggest terrorists in the us followed by left wing extremists now should we be worried about latin american extremists obviously not the amount of the crimes committed isnt as important as the damage caused i would argue that all the deaths due to muslim extremists is far more than that of latinos in the us another problem is that these numbers are domestic only europe has had a lot of terrorist attacks the muslim world as well afghanistan iraq pakistan and israel have terror attacks almost daily  all of you arguing against op have utterly failed to provide any data of your own the iraq war was not a christian war its main instigator was jewishit was for very secular reasons despite that it was a very just war and christians can be proud that they tried to liberate iraq and make life better for iraqis tens of thousands of iraqis have been killed by terrorist attacks since american troops left iraq those are the people america was fighting for not for christianitygtthats a tight little bubble you live in you should expand your searchyour own link shows that none of the american terrorism was committed in the name of christianity the link is extremely biased as is every other link youve posted stating the boston bombers were murderers not terrorists because they didnt kill many people even though terrorism is about motivation rather than how many you kill and the boston bombers were certainly motivated to cause terror in the name of islam rather than to kill people as an atheist you really shouldnt be supporting such antiatheist sources such as the guardian which calls atheists racist for criticising islam thats the united states protest people invaded sold slavery those things happened  years ago this silly argument hes saying to remember that muslim people are not monsters but people just as vulnerable to hatred and violence as any group of people are including christians  gthes saying to remember that muslim people are not monsters but people just as vulnerable to hatred and violence as any group of people are including christians this  the us was founded on genocide and slavery  of course we can denounce it but its hypocritical for us to point the finger at everyone but ourselves and call ourselves defenders of peaceful democracy and saviors of the world youre making an irrelevant point you understand that these things happened over  years ago correct yes it happened but it has no influence on whether or not we have a place to say anything about the atrocities in our modern world dont be so fucking absurd gt it has no influence on whether or not we have a place to say anything about the atrocities in our modern worldhence why i saidgt of course we can denounce it but its hypocritical for us to point the finger at everyone but ourselves and call ourselves defenders of peaceful democracy and saviors of the worldby the way youre way overplaying the over  years ago bit  slavery may have been officially abolished over  years ago but it still lives in practice in many forms such as social and economic oppression the drug war treatment of immigrants and prison workforces  we may not officially condone genocide within our borders but we continue to expand the empire kill people pretty indiscriminately to do it where we can get away with it in a sportsmanlike fashion among firstclassi mean firstworld countries and support brutish abusive and inhumane governments  we also continue to treat native americans like secondclass citizens pollute and destroy their land even the land weve agreed they can use destroy their holy places in a way we would never deface christian churches and turn a blind eye to discrimination against them  we just hide it and distract from it a bit better these daysacting like were so past that is at best ignorant and at worst dishonest and in no way helps the conversation well you enjoy your glass half empty examination of our world today were safer than weve ever been technology and medicine are more advanced than i couldve ever imagined and as a whole our species is going in a decent direction for the first time in history im pretty stoked never said im down on the whole state of the world  us foreign affairs is a big deal but its not everything  there are plenty of amazing things happening all the time  im stoked about whats happening in greece and spain right now but thats a topic for a different time well its ok then as these days the us is supporting slavery tolerating regimes like the ones in yemen and mauritania so i guess its not hypocritical in this regard didnt the yemeni government get overthrown by the alhouthi a few weeks back yemen is a tough case anyway with its mountainous terrian peoples crippling qat addiction high birth rate high illiteracy rate and aqap id say ali saleh fucked up that country more than anyone else only hopped on the proamerica train after his buddy sadam hussein was pushed out of power  yeah  good point   but at least we dont support it at home because the wealthy white owners of the country already have such a strong foothold on land and capital they can simply use legal means to turn us into povertystricken peasants who worship our untitled kings you know whats silly not reading the article and commenting on it most christians i know want an islamic genocide  no its saying that theyre happening today thats wrong its funny this guy compares militias africa to the  the nd popular religion earth who want people killed insulting islam to the actual islamists absurd christianity bad its that bad you talk the you like amp islam poses greater threat than religion or presumably popular ideology generallysam harris amp cenk uygur talked this issue hours its youtube amp sam was rightedit weve saudi arabia whipping atheists amp beheading people religious crimes weve pakistan egypt iran iraq syria yemen jordan with the support islamic law they there amp the islamic law they enforce amp then weve places southeast asia where vast majority muslims wants limbs amputated theft amp  muslims moderate indonesia want adulterers stoned to death amp weve majority british muslims calling the prosecution those who draw muhammad this equal to the damage the lords resistance army the congo no for some reason both the popular articles on this subject posted in ratheism were written by people on both sides of the extreme on this issue and both were extremely wrong mysterious what was the other extreme i must have missed that post there was another rightwing one too both upvoted in the thousands  there was nothing right wing about that article unless you consider having the tenacity to question a us democrat leader inherently right wing and it was not an extreme article it was pretty decent amp cogent exactly heres a link to the videopeople who are saying that these religions are equally bad in terms of violence are completely wrong its utterly ridiculous  sam harris talks about this quite extensively in end of faith  i know some muslims amp they dont support isis but i know some christians who support george w bush amp he was just as bad as osama bin laden when you look at the death count this is the ethically perverse noam chomsky style thinking that has gotten the better of a lot of people theyre imaging that muslim support for islamism is only like  or something as if those pollsters gallup amp pew are part of an imperial christian white supremacist patriarchal homophobic vaccineloving conspiracy to lock up falafeleating families in torture camps  i live dearborn with  percent muslim population there sharia law killing religion they  generations here they greatly americanized there arab fear felt the population religions violent period islam special not religion peace i that moral relativism pretty common these days this article ridiculous the holocaust ww ww  were christian warslaughably silly contention wwi and wwii were not christian wars correct but the holocaust was a bunch of good christians thinking that they were doing the lords work as they shoveled people into ovens  utter horseshit  its laughably ignorantyoure aware that jesus was jewish   and that the bible considers jews gods chosen people extremism bad which religion its of religion gonna religion its pointless to equate what going to what happened the past we the the opportunity to mak what happened the happen again yea we did have that opportunity about  years ago  but instead the western world has thoroughly screwed around in the middle east  the creation of israel along with the huge amount of oil makes it a constant war zone  it takes a lot of oil to run a war machine

like or dislike   had there been a teleprompter joke thrown in there wed have made a bingo like or dislike   wow ignorance sure is white in iowa and ignorant like or dislike   this is truly fringe theres more evidence that he was born in kenya than there is that hes a muslim okay okay theres the same amount of evidence  zero like or dislike   and yet academia has a liberal bias like or dislike   they must have recruited this bunch directly from the glenn beck audience like or dislike   this is truly fringe for republicans its mainstream like or dislike   how is liberalism the most intolerant of all as it is the very definition of belief in equal rights wouldnt it be more aptly described as the most tolerant of all why does it make a difference if he is muslim or a muslim sympathizer i would say its easily just as dangerous to be a christian or a christian sympathizer you both have killed senselessly over the last two thousand years you both have your extremists and your moderates both your religions are based on the same god in fact you share half each others holy books both religions believe it or not propose to be based on peace and love my favorite part is the good america does in the world as an actual provider of that good in the middle east believe me when i say these people could have done without it i see most of the comments agree with my side but im writing this in hopes someone from that audience will see this and just for a second consider educating themselves before speaking like or dislike   dumb mfers need to be called dumb mfers theres too much patience for this kind of shiz like or dislike   they havent a clue about egypt islam or democracy if obama comes out against mubarek and mubarek wins weve lost an ally if he comes out definitely against he

like or dislike   hes a muslin hes cheap fabric for creating clothes designs like or dislike   i am from iowa and sadly this type of thinking runs rampant among too many conservative iowa republicans

same fucking thing did he not specifically state in an interview that he listened to god when making decisions god damn do i hate stupid motherfuckersend rant gt and bush didnt do the same fucking thingnot the same at all  because christianity is right  islam is wrong god damn it the sarcasm is so thick and yet i still raged actually its because were a christian nation christian nation bush  gog  magog  apocalypse ftw but they wa good kreeshan belleefs what bush had but bush wasnt a socialist communist fascist radical marxist secret muslim doublesecret atheist kenyan indonesian nazi  nope bush was the best thing ever she didnt care about that since it was her religion its shit this that ashamed to iowan two of my clients are in that crowd shame can you sterilize them in their sleep til  with your jeep came here to say this it makes me feel bad im even from the same state as these people i understand  it makes me feel bad to have driven through that statein all fairness though every state has a bunch of friggin rightwing idiots these people are probably from west of des moines can we just give that part of iowa to nebraska  west des moines i think you mean these people are probably from rural iowa there is nothing rural about those people   um no shit did you not understand i was pointing out that the problem is not the people from west des moines its the backwards redneck hicks from the towns of  who have ultra christian values and dont want no darkey as their president unless im mistaken obama took iowa quite easily in  did he not  perhaps the real problem is pompus assholes assuming that since iowa is a farming state it is completely populated with rednecks and hillbillies that would rather burn the country to the ground before voting for a democrat and more specifically a black democrat  my point is that the people in that for lack of a better term poll were hand picked by fox news and obviously had no idea what the hell they are talking about  one of them said that he has no idea what we want as a country in regards to egypts situation  now im sorry but how should what we want factor into another countrys govt  im sorry this has been a little disjointed and sporadic but i just wanted to point out that these people have no real grasp on what is really happening but that doesnt mean that all of iowa should be typecast because of them just my opinion no disrespect exactly iowa is not any different than the rest of country it is all about where you get information and how you are taught its not about where you are from or what religion you believe  it is about controlling informationi was poking fun at the people in the western part of the state for electing wackos like steve king over and over hey i get that  it sucks i live in the western part of the state and we have our share of dummies a lot of them are in my family  but i want to believe that if given proper information our state is capable of sane decisions  now if we could only get correct information instead of your run of the mill rhetoric   youre so ignorant i grew up in one of those towns  they arent as universally assbackwards as you seem to believe pyatta said west of des moines not west des moines how is that not west des moines  west des moines is suburb of des moines  from where i grew up in the heart of east des moines it looked like only rich people lived thererural iowa farther from des moines in most any direction is a whole different animal  theres a joke about the southern part of iowa where my father grew up  the counties in iowa are mostly neat little rows of boxes across the state  if you took the southern most two rows and gave them to missouri youd raise the average iq of each state missouri burn love it maybe if we paid em to take it ok use google map give everything west of  to nebraska does that help  geez thats how iowa got the half breed tract in se iowa missouri didnt want it hey i am from omaha keep that shit away from me send it south or north or something oh home state of mine starts slow clap not out of pride but so they can comprehend that i am clapping its not iowa its fox news and their deliberately misleading journalism  they could get a dozen likeminded knuckle heads from any state and parade them on national tv as a nonbiased focus group  i dont believe that your typical iowan is that fucking dumb ya i cant argue with that considering the source is faux news  but its still embarrassing to see iowans represented that way i think that was an astroturf focus group that was assembled to spew rightwing talking points instead of what it is purported to be which is average iowa republicans giving their sincere opinions this is like a case study in propaganda polls and the abuse of linguistics and statistics fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu frank luntz its shit like this that almost makes me ashamed to be an american to be honest with you the democrats make me ashamed to be an americanthe republicans make me ashamed to be a human being the real shit is that americans think they have the right to decide who is to rule egypt  wikileaks cable presidential succession in egypt seconded people like vander plaats need to move to texas better than oklahoma but i feel you man it sucks living around fucking fools im guessing that having to be the home state of michelle bachmann probably doesnt help either as a minnesotan i must unfortunately inform you that you are mistaken home state not current state  shes from waterloo iowa ah didnt know that just say that she originated from there because otherwise its confusing what you meant gotcha no worries  the only reason i even know is because its relevant for the caucuses and steve king and bob vander plaats i was hoping this was fake then i realized wasnt at this point i think them want to hes muslim they to accept christian and if they dont have to accept him as a christian then they can dismiss him as the other who is unworthy to be followed after the electionedit i remembered the song from south pacific and it seems to fitcableyouve got to be taughtto hate and fearyouve got to be taughtfrom year to yearits got to

written in  and was actually quite controversialapparently for being too communist sigh bigots never change  its interesting how a song about racial tolerance was condemned as having a communist agenda only in america this is fakekinda frank lutz was kicked out of every major political sciencestatistical professional group because of the unethical and unscientific methods he was using basically this guy produces numbers and while the majority of political statistical work done on fox through its statistical partner opinion dynamics is legit the shit done by lutz is just that shit any of us could put together a group of people that would respond this way even if your polling a group of republicans the overall heterogeneity of the group should be minimal a diversity of ages educational background and gender should apply edit pause at  of the video even with minimal ethnic diversity in iowa there should be a much more diverse group of people if lutz were creating a representative focus group think about this from a research perspective hes got a definitive group republican iowa caucus members making it a pretty easy group to statistically analyze youve got a definitive number in the group and guaranteed because they are voters and their votes included data about where the live  how much they make gender age in the voter registration a description of what the group looks like this leads to very simple math if  percent of the group are women then  percent of my focus group give or take a few should be women  college educated group  college educated in the focus group etc theres no way that this group correlates with the way that the iowa republican caucus looks like this is a cherry picked group that is created to echo certain ideas this isnt real science hence the reason lutz doesnt have professional credibility anymore what they are producing is a very specific echo thats marketed as vast opinion   all that would be all well and good except for the fact that frank luntzs strategies work the recommendations he passes down based on this data collection actually do steer the public discourse and win republicans elections if his sampling wasnt accurate if his questions were not actionable then his recommendations would fail but they dont he wins more than he loses  gtall that would be all well and good except for the fact that frank luntzs strategies work the recommendations he passes down based on this data collection actually do steer the public discourse and win republicans electionsi dont think your right this works because of an echo trust me political scientists do focus groups all the time producing opinion is not hard and understanding how people construct their vote isnt complicated either this works because of a very important construct legitimized news source  print allies who produce similar ideologies  an active ideology that discounts those who disagree  strong ties to a religious base  an overall social confusion some white folks are emotionally confused with the election of a black president it upsets some very fundamental ideas in the us pres when you add to that a media experience which is presented as ideas of the viewers peers like this focus group purported to do it makes a very convincing story for a lot of people research has shown that people are now making political decisions after they watch new agencies produce opinions about political events in fact research out of utah of college students showed that they actual could not create their own political opinions without viewing fox news after a political event in that case it was the state of the union this isnt something that is limited to the political right but this shit isnt entirely complicated it just has a lot of moving parts bottom line is that frank lutz is not responsible for the right wing winning elections in the past few years hes simply a tool being used along with a number of other factors  gt in fact research out of utah of college students showed that they actual could not create their own political opinions without viewing fox news after a political event in that case it was the state of the union this isnt something that is limited to the political right but this shit isnt entirely complicated it just has a lot of moving partscan i get a source  that sounds like an interesting article   i read that republicans are much more likely to not have traveled and to not have been confronted with different cultures and different ways of looking at the world  perhaps republicans are more likely to be unable to create their own political opinion because they have not ever had to hold beliefs that were different from their community  if you accept whatever is commonly believed by your peers then you dont need to start generating your own opinions   shit let me look around i actually heard the research because i was on a panel at the western political science association about  years ago where this research was presented ill try and remember the name of the woman that created the work ill send you a pm if i can find it  i think we are saying a lot of the same thing frank luntzs rhetorical recommendations are used by the right to great success the death tax is franks baby for example yes people get influenced by the echochamber but the echo chamber is fed by luntz and verified by rasmussen i agree with everything you said basically people that are making up their mind after watching the commentary are being influenced by luntz because its luntzs action plan that determines how the commentators frame their commentary if the president says investment luntz recommends you present that as spending for example notice how so many of these people just brushed aside the presidents words and indicated that he isnt very knowledgeable  thats luntz hes spent  years advising the right to attack obamas core competency competence hes arguably one of the most intelligent educated men to hold the office of the presidency for a long time so what do you do just say hes a clueless fruitbag over and over and over again while simultaneously demonizing book lerninnotice the woman who said he gives textbook answers hey lady the answer in the textbook is often the correct answer   gteven if youre polling a group of republicans the overall heterogeneity of the group should be minimal come oni got heterogeneity right thats gotta count for something what about jerimiah wright they cant have it both ways sure they can  they just dont connect the rev wright part of the brain to the hes a towelhead part of the brain im a fullthroated obama supporter and dont believe hes much of a christianhes just giving lip service to something that is required for election in this country i like the part where obama makes reference to the christian value of my brothers keeper un fucking believable  everyone of them  nobody in that group was willing to say they believe the president is christian  not one  what the fuck that makes me sad  iowa i will avoid you   take it easy on iowa most people are legit on a more important note bacon comes from iowa    land obacon you say  ok i take it back   i wasnt serious anyhow   largest frying pan brandon iowasee also wow i grew up maybe  miles from brandon and had no idea the frying pan is a new thing probably less than  years old i guess they have a cowboy breakfast a couple times a year in brandon that draws a good crowd i wonder if the iowa gop faux cus group is aware that the mother mosque of america is in iowa wow cool  til i know exactly where that is my wife lived off ellis blvd when we were dating born and raised in cedar rapids iowa when i saw this i did a huge facepalm and felt incredibly embarrassed i hate fox for making me feel like that then i started reading what everyone is commenting and realized that people believe stories from the onion over fox news mmmm corn and bacon haha  i like to ask conservatives if barack obama is a muslim why did he sit in rev wrights church for  yearsconservatives usually snap back with something questioning the patriotism of rev wright then i remind them that rev wright served in the usmc and those who are questioning his patriotism are draft dodgers and chicken hawks good times  muslim christian doesnt matter obamas word means nothing hes already been caught in web after web of lies and broken promises would it really surprise you if he wasnt a christian hes probably an athiest and if he was i wouldnt care as long as he has a history of having good morales and standards which he doesnt show me a citation for web after web of lies and while he or she is at it maybe they can sourcegtas long as he has a history of having good morales and standards which he doesntwaits patiently to be fair in obamas book dreams of my father obama admits he sold pounds of drugs google is your friend off the top of my head lies not raising taxes on those making less than k transparency public reading of legislationcspan bipartisanship obamacare not being a tax etc the list goes on and a search uncovers many sources i voted for obama but weve still got gitmo and two wars with no real end in sight nobel peace prize laureate barack obama ordered drone strikes within  hours of taking office even that was true what whats wrong with muslim answer nothing well thats our answer yeshowever these people are likely bigots and probably hate all muslims  so to them the answer is more along the lines of everything reminds me of a pickup truck i saw on the interstate on my way to work today guy had about twenty stickers on the back window and the ones that i saw were all farright bs fight back vote republican the gadsden flag tea party support for the fox news blank slate thats now our districts congressman enough info to know that i never want to place myself within fifty feet of that jackoff without even including the sticker on the other side of the window in big letters god is great allah is not and thats the kind of person that grits his teeth turns the corners of his mouth down unconsciously and narrows his eyes closer to a glare when he declares that president obama is a muslim  i disagree there are lots of things wrong when someone regularly talks to an imaginary person in the sky must resist feeding trolls wow being an atheist is now considered being a troll on rpolitics no being a douchebag is it implies being a muslim is bad which of course its not so what if he is a muslim a room full retards hey now dont say that about retards goes to church checkreads the bible checktells people hes christian checksounds muslim to meand wtf that white guy the bigot talking when obama religion liberalism that religion dumbass its politics are you going to mad when construction worker too busy buildings praying going to church he follows his blueprints more than his religion stupid construction worker the bible is the only scaffold i need are you trying to imply that obama muslim because going through presidential election two years office im pretty that the media would cover that up than use story if wasnt muslim why would born hawaii normal state iowa in conclusion checkmate logic  how does it work logic is like the tides you cant explain it deleted no you wont lol born in hawaiiill believe that when i see an autopsy  hes clearly a demon spawned by the devil  or a robot protip never go full retard i understand people honestly retarded bullshit amazedashamed its on tv its on radio its in newspapers its on the internet their friends tell them their parents tell them etc etc exactly they believe obama is a muslim because of a large collection of external influences many documented and well known their behavior is largely a visible side effect of our political system its probably not moral to be mad at the people who believe its unfair to blame the victims the masses of morons and to blame the media outlets is to risk being labeled as an enemy of free speech its like a trap this is why im for improving education across the board we have to get more kids bullshit detectors up and running before they accidentally absorb too much harmful media influence and turn into people like this easily they want to fox news so to choose what  crazy religious christians crazy religious muslims   chose separation church state  i want to get gay married these peoples front yard to them squirm lets hijack their church bus and take them to a gay bar i want to take you to a gay bar a gay bar well its iowa so have at it just make sure its an illegal mexican as well i want to downvote these people dumb id to what these people think we egypt they clue whats going there either

criticize president obama on foreign policy matters republican presidential candidate mitt romney late tuesday issued a statement blasting the obama administration for a statement from the us embassy in cairo expressing what it characterized as sympathy for muslims upset by antimuslim activity in the united states then in a press briefing wednesday morning in jacksonsville fla romney intensified that criticism saying the embassys statement was akin to an apology and disgraceful however the obama administration maintains that the embassy statement was issued before the compound came under attack by protesters and four american diplomats were killed including us ambassador christopher stevens obama reelection campaign spokesman lis smith said the embassy had not yet been breached when they the embassy issued the statement hes criticizing his first answer was wrong the us embassys statement early on tuesday condemned an antimuslim video being promoted by gainesville fla pastor terry jones who earlier had threatened to burn more than  copies of the koran the video reportedly mocks islams founding prophet muhammad and was bound to inflame muslims the embassy of the united states in

statement late tuesday said he was outraged by attacks on american diplomatic missions in libya and egypt and the death of an american consulate worker in benghazi its disgraceful that the obama administrations first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks romney said about the same time as romneys statement secretary of state hillary rodham clinton strongly denounced the killing of an embassy official whom she did not identify at that time she said that the united states is committed to religious tolerance but let me be clear she said in the statement there is never any justification for violent acts of this kind slideshow the death of the us ambassador to libya and the response  video the obama campaign also responded early on wednesday lambasting romney for bringing politics into a tragedy we are shocked that at a time when the united states of america is confronting the tragic death of one of our diplomatic officers in libya gov romney would choose to launch a political attack obama campaign spokesman ben labolt said in a statement later wednesday morning after the administration confirmed the death of stevens obama issued a statement strongly condemning what he called an outrageous attack romney has frequently accused obama of traveling the world apologizing for america and he published a

obama administration do to help him the leaks came from pakistan and the only thing the obama administration did was to say that the doctor did not act in interests against his country what hes talking about this guythe us helped him set up a vaccination program as a front to collect dna  it is likely he had no idea who lived in the compound only that the us knew there was something more to that place through the dna the us would have been able to figure out if it was bin laden or some other alqaidi official or no one of importance  if i recall correctly we made the move on bin laden before he was ever able to collect any dna but his accounts of his attempts helped confirm us suspicions that some one very high up was staying there you mean the doctor the cia offered to help get

closet stoner hes admitted to hitting the pipe in his youngn days deleted my bad nice link hes tried cocaine before too its not exactly a secret cocaine is usually a powder that is snorted not smoked like the salt form known as crack i never realised obama played the mouth of sauron  he doesnt hes played by the pilot from mad max  pi guess he managed to chow down on that dog food after allclearly lotr is actually set in the future way after the apocalypse elves orcs dwarves trolls and hobbits are irradiated mutants jebediah has gained immortality and sauron is actually tina turner in disguise aragorn is maxs great great great great great great etc grandsonwhat was the topic again teehee teehee teehee     love it   nigga high as shit  thats how he shouldve done it ive watched this  times and still cant find where the switchblend is  unless the whole thing is an impersonator edit  oh shit that guys good  i think i heard about him on this american life or something its right after he turns from the podium if you look carefully you can see the presidential flag or we it is shifts  its easier to see on the actual videoregardless its one of my favorite obama videos trying to find what you meant i noticed his head seemed to shrink  i thought it was just from an snl skit or something watch the stars on the blue flag on the right i dont know what its called yea if it is the same guy from the tal episode that was a good episode hell any tal episode is a good episode just in case youre being serious this is redditcant blame me for assuming i think this is from snl its from letterman irc edit its actually from leno  no im quite sure this is actually him but in some shopped photography haha you know as an australian somehow reddit had managed to convince me that this was legitimately how he had broken the news im ultra disappointed now before it happened i was hoping for thislimbaugh hannity and beck are called into a surprise press conference at the white house and given front row seats obama steps out glares around a bit then looks behind the stage and says bring em out boys a pair of secret service agents escort a chained osama bin laden outobama stares at the rightwingers in the front row their mouths agape after a few moments of silence obama looks them straight in the eye and says fuck you then he walks off stopping only to kick bin laden in the balls but it doesnt look like a happy kick to me more an angry one   i think there are some people who think that youre joking but seriously that would have been the way to do it  a lot of voters just want a strong president  that would have cinched that vote  and most of the rest of us who want actual substance in our politicans and dont care whether they act like arnold schwarzenegger or whether they act like steve carells  year old virgin that wouldnt have lost our vote even now this is one of my favorite gifs  whats the source of this ive loved this for a long time but never known where its from nice try secret service saturday night live i thought it was from jimmy kimmel  its from the tonight show with jay lenosource every time this gets posted people name every show but lenos lol im pretty sure it was from the daily show all the presidents memeswhy obama gets so much love on the internet its from the tonight show jay leno not snl  snopes theres no door there ftr im on the toilet in the public bathroom at work and cant stop laughing my ass off must wait til all are gone before i can leave stall everytime this come up i cannot stop watching it  it was obviously a suprise mercy killing hed been suffering with health problems for so long pres obama thought that he deserved a quick death at the hands of our highly trained assisted suicide squad the navy seals death by assisted euthanasia death panels well if youre going to take over healthcare with the government the seals are probably an ok way to go about it yeah after  he wasnt  able to seek medical attention in the states anymore why oh why does obama love terrorists so much sarcastic mocking of fox news types and setting him up with some swanky oceanfrontbottom property hehe frontbottom they exist i expected this my brothers college football pickem name is charlieweisfrontbutt i see your charlie weiss and raise you one bill parcellsfrontbuttbaked potato combo have you kids finished playin games that outfit is a warcrime a very good band shes hes shes hes got a front butt medically proven hes got a sicilian secretary of defense two to the head and dump the body in the ocean never go in against a sicilian when death is on the line  at this point i think its the other classic blunder we should be more worried about its inconceivable ftfygtnever go in againthst a thithilian when deathhh isth on the line  in the morning good sir  minutes actually did an interesting piece on him fox news at it again here is there version of events they failed to mention the fact that the statement was issued by the embassy before the attacks took place im not surprised deleted usa usa usa being an american means never having to say youre sorry  apologizies are for sissies  its a sign of weakness the united states has nothing to apologize for because weve never ever done anything wrong  ever i like this representationwish i could add the audio  worked for me my favorite part is that theres no proof that happened at all other than the continued insistence that it happened as the president said and the part where they dump his body in the middle of the ocean after shooting an unarmed suspect supposedly the greatest source of intelligence in modern history who didnt use his wife as a human shield that tickles me  but this happened only because mr bush personally gave every gitmo inmate an enhanced neckbath  enhanced nasal cavity rinse even better after repeatedly delaying the strike to the point where gen petreus was about to have forces go in without his authorization  the same forces the piece of shit president was threatening not to pay if his retarded budget wasnt forced through  bwahahahah oh wait you actually believe what you just said except everything i said is true you can find obama talking about his threats to not pay the armed forces  this isnt pixie dust   im sure obama is the only president in our history to use one thing as leverage to another that they wanted to get passed im not sure what youre bitching about they got paid and we got osama what exactly did he do wrong youre complaining just because you dont like the president   please show me any clip that has david petraeus saying he was going to go into pakistan without authorization pleaseas for the other thing how do you think our soldiers get paid they get paid through budgets and the republicans were flat out refusing to vote for the budget that had their monies in it they were doing this because they refuse to vote for anything obama puts forward because they stupidly think that being obstructionists is going to help them in novemberthey finally caved when they fucked our credit rating assholes all of them please explain how repupblicans fucked our credit rating  do you even know how theyre calculatedapplied   our credit rating got dropped and probably will be again because of the out of control spending read the statement from the agency on why it was lowered  it has nothing to do with republicans budgeting its a direct response to reckless spending and an exploding deficit  basically the two hallmarks of the idiot in the white house now  yes the moron before him got the ball rolling but obama takes it to another level it was a direct result of the gops refusal to raise the debt ceiling that caused the downgrade of the credit rating the ratings agency basically cited paul ryan by name when he explained why they lowered the ratingdont tell me they were trying to save america by holding the debt ceiling hostage because they raised it  times under bush they used all of america to score political points and fucked us in doing sowheres the david petraeus clip im really excited to see where he said he was going to undermine the presidents authority go on drudge they have the petraeus article linkedthey did not cite paul ryan by name they stated that the increasing debt and lack of solution was the reason for the lowering  just raising the debt limit again and again and again isnt a solution  thats one of the ways we got in this mess in the first place when bush was pissing on the economy  the statement wasnt obama himself it was people inside the embassy who were trying to calm the protestors they wouldnt killednot that happened the embassy was attacked attempt to diffuse the situationmitt romney dead american wait till the body was cold exploiting the death personal gain you people have to trust him he feels what you humans call desperation he feels im not convinced well you know that feeling like when you make more money in a year than most people will see in a lifetime its hard to describe but it feels kind of like that im not convinced because the gop wont release his proprietary software i want to make my own mittbot damnnit oh man i havent seen you in a while do you still downvote all your posts feels its emulated i emulate that feel bro i run that feelempathy bro its actually a very complex algorithm pretty impressive stuff on the part of his programmers  of course he feels he was programm er um he is only human romney  we mean to say that study with focus groups grassroots campaigning has lead us to believe that if he were to feel this way it would engender sympathy for his campaign  and so he feels desperation  fellow extraterrestrial have you made ready for the initial takeover phase dude i cant figure out how to

start your landing nice try ann   mittens draft and tax dodger robme the best aliens could come up with  his little speech on tv was bad enoughhere a quick transcriptgtthis uh attack on american individuals and embassies is outragous its disgusting it uh it breaks the hearts of all of us who think of these people who have served during their lives the cause of freedom and justice and honor we uh we mourn their loss and join together in prayer that the spirit of the allmighty might comfort the families of those who have been so brutally slaingtgti also believe the administration was wrong to stand by a statement sympathazing with those who had breached our embassy in egypt instead of condemning their actions its never too early for the united states goverment to condemn attacks on americans and to defend our values the white house distanced themselves from the statement saying it wasnt cleared by washington and that reflects the mixed signals theyre sending to the worldthats right equal time an effort spent bitching about the administration and their message sympathizing with muslims then admitting  seconds later in the same speech that washington didnt actually make those statements and that this fact makes it even worse washington is sending mixed signals as evidenced by this signal they didnt send that i am falsely attributing to them so they can deny having said itand then as if that wasnt enough the asshole goes out and posts the same basic thing on his blog only now without even a caveat about the fact that the white house did not in fact sympathize with the attackersgtim outraged by the attacks on american diplomatic missions in libya and egypt and by the death of an american consulate worker in benghazi  gtgtits disgraceful that the obama administrations first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions but to sympathize with those who waged the attacksgtmitt romneythe best part of all of this the statement of sympathy that romney is referring to came out before the attacks happened tweeted by a member of the us embassy in egypt not the administration heres what he tweeted the message that romney is all up in arms about this was said over a few separate tweets some of which have since been deletedgtthe embassy of the united states in cairo condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of muslims  as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions  today the th anniversary of the september   terrorist attacks on the united states americans are honoring our patriots and those who serve our nation as the fitting response to the enemies of democracy  respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of american democracy  we firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of othersi pulled that full quote off of a few different sources and it was fully put together herealthough beware if you go to that site its spewing some pretty rightslanted views right no and is a bit headache inducing in a this is what some people actually believe kind of wayit seems to me that this actual set of quotes from the embassy dont fit the narrative that romney is trying to speak to explaining why he isnt actually using any quotes  hes just saying the administration was sympathizing with the attackers its a boldface lie on the face of it no matter how you look at itoh it gets better too today hes out defending himself heres him giving a little qa about this after explaining that he agrees with the administration and the way they distanced themselves from the embassys statement a reporter asks what did the white house do wrong then since you agree with themhis replygttheir administration spoke the president takes responsibility not just for the words that come from his mouth but also for the words that come from his ambassadors from his administration from his embassies from his state department they clearly they clearly sent mixed messages to the world and uh the statement that came from the administration and the embassy is the administration the statement that came from the administration was a statement that was akin to apology and i think was a severe miscalculationthats just my direct transcript from the videoremember embassies are administration my friendshis final word on this whole debacle is pretty funny too why did he speak out so early why did he stand on the stillwarm corpse and give a little speech against obamahis transcribed answer gti spoke out when the key fact that i referred to was known which was that the embassy of the united states issued what appeared to be an apology for american principlesthat was a mistake and i believe that when a mistake is made of that significance you speak out  mitt romneyromneys not the only one making an ass out of themselves over this either heres a little fb post by sarah palin for examplegtapparently president obama cant see egypt and libya from his house on the anniversary of the worst terrorist attacks ever perpetrated on america our embassy in cairo and our consulate in benghazi were attacked by violent islamic mobs in cairo they scaled the walls of our embassy destroyed our flag and replaced it with a black islamic banner in benghazi the armed gunmen set fire to our consulate and killed an american staff member the islamic radicals claim that these attacks are in protest to some film criticizing islam in response to this the us embassy in cairo issued a statement that was so outrageous many of us thought it must be a satire the embassy actually apologized to the violent mob attacking us and it even went so far as to chastise those who use free speech to hurt the religious feelings of muslims funny the current administration has no problem hurting the religious feelings of catholicsgtbut where is the presidents statement about this these countries represent his much touted arab spring hows that arab spring working out for us now have we received an apology yet from our friends in the muslim brotherhood for the assault on our embassygtits about time our president stood up for america and condemned these islamic extremists i realize there must be a lot on his mind these days  what with our economys abysmal jobless numbers and moodys new warning about yet another downgrade to our nations credit rating due to the current administrations failure to come up with a credible deficit reduction plan and of course he has a busy schedule  with all those rounds of golf softball interviews with the pimp with the limp and fundraising dinners with his corporate cronies but our nations security should be of utmost importance to our commanderinchief america cant afford any more leading from behind in such a dangerous world we already know that president obama likes to speak softly to our enemies if he doesnt have a big stick to carry maybe its time for him to grow onegt sarah palini find this one particularly amusing on tons of levels in defense of romney i think that when confronted with an angry mob embassy members should have said they dont sympathize with offended muslims and instead applaud the proud americans who made the shitty  mohammed youtube video then their deaths would have been quicker and more american  romney is a foreign policy master  sarc thats the kind of clear leadership that romney would bring to us foreign policy  and hes well qualified to lead our nation around the world because he can yell go fuck yourself muslim darkie in both english and french he can say bomb them all let jesus sort them out and we all know thats all hed really be good for on foreign policy usa usa usa dont mind me im just looking at this prophet muhammad cartoon in the danish jyllandsposten i guess honestly i would rather insult their religion if i sensed they were going to kill me anyway  hmm you all arent really going to listen to reason so i may as well try to make all your heads explode out of anger at this drawing im making right here  anyone know if octopi have eight penises  do they even have penises  lets just assume they do and they have one on each arm shall we romney strikes me as insincere no matter what comes out of his mouth  im sure that he believes some of it and has some emotions  but he always seems fake no matter what he is saying watching him stumble through those statements i very much got the feeling that he is presenting a position worked out by advisers  i dont doubt that he is uncomfortable with a complex and sophisticated foreign policy which is appropriate for our current multipolar world and would prefer a more simplistic approach but he isnt so stupid as to actually believe what he is saying  and as a result hes bungling through it and comes across as to put it politely insincereconsidering the fact that his campaigns foreign policy advisers are the same carload of clowns that ran things for the stunningly awful george w bush administration it is anything but surprising that romneys response would be simultaneously incompetent and disingenuous i think he could be a much better actor his thoughts are just focused on spinning whatever the question is into the message hes trying to get across without being too obviousreporter mr romney do you have a reaction to the tragedy in cairoromney yes my reaction is that the president is wrong on the economy and it will cost american jobsreporter sigh that palin post you sure thats not satire that sounds too stupid even for her especially the cant see from his house part and the penis reference palin has gone fullpalin you never go fullpalin fulltrig it comes directly from her actual facebook account i linked it for you so yes its heri didnt even bother to break it down because the whole post is hilarious without any commentary necessary sarah palin says obama doesnt have a big stick wants him to grow one wishes he could see libya from his house discussion of the pimp with the limpits just beautifully awful i think the big stick is a reference to teddy roosevelts big stick diplomacyspeak softly and carry a big stick you will go far still funny of her to bring that up i know what it was a reference to in this context though hilarity ensuesits pretty funny both ways really because obama is a rather soft speaker and hes prone to shoot terrorists in the face calling obama out for not being strong enough against extremists is rather hilarious on the face of it sarah palin doing it in a way that can easily be misread as a penis size reference is just gold yes it is but she turns it into a penis joke by using the word grow she is actually referring to joe bidenwho was himself making a tr referencegti promise you the president has a big stick biden said after quoting president teddy roosevelts enduring foreign policy advice to speak softly and carry a big stickgtthe audience at new york university responded with scattered laughtergti promise you biden repeated deadpanning wow just wow shes a complete moron you know if katie couric had asked palin where benghazi was she would have been dumbfounded wouldve made for some good humor her facebook post is so incredibly pathetic i cant even comment on it other than to say it is the same thing that any rightwing nut from all of our facebook walls cause thats all she is she is less than nothing with zero credentials poor john mccain i sifted through some of the comments from palins post mygod i didnt know it was that bad i mean how is it even possible to express yourself in such an immatureyearoldjustgotintopoliticsihavesuchstrongopinions kind of way  i assume you are calling the big stick a penis referenceas much as i hate palin i feel the need to mention that she was most likely referring to this it was a pun the big stick does refer to that but then she says grow one oh i didnt even read the last couple words of the quote so yeah she definitely meant that as a penis reference do people still care what governor halfterm thinks no but i couldnt resist putting her words up there in light of the absolute stupidity present  i blame the vicodin gtapparently president obama cant see egypt and libya from his housewhat does that even mean does she realize that she is making fun of herself while trying to act like some foreign policy wonkwhy do conservatives elevate halfwit people like her joe plumber paul ryan etc to leader status and keep them there even after they are exposed to be out of their depth in politics gtdoes she realize that she is making fun of herselfactually the i can see russia from my house line was said by tina fey when she was impersonating palin still i dont see how the line you quoted works as a burn coming from palin im sorry i have to ask this in all seriousness  are those actually comments from ms palin and not something from the onion  i honestly cant tell parody from actual statements from the former vice presidential candidate the link is right there  its her own official facebook page go read it its got over  likes right now hah and she has the nerve to say obama has no experience it is amazing people still look to her for political commentary and vote for who she endorses sources by chance sure heres the sourceshis blog post right off mittromneycomand his little speech captured on video i went ahead and transcribed it to text while watching it for my post above thank you kindly have yourself a great day no problem i apologize for not linking them in the first place making your sources known so others can see and judge for themselves is part of any informed political discussion i wonder if mitt romney would care to share his source from the administration that put out sympathy for the people attacking and killing our embassy workers  sarah palin lt fouriers gangrene this is the same mitt romney who was so smug and pleased about how much he would not go into pakistan to ice bin laden who turned the everpassionate british against him in a matter of minutes and months away from the election has already started increasing tensions with russiathis whole thing takes me back to that hostage negotiation with those pirates a few years back all the right wing channels bloviators pundits and politicians are tripping over themselves calling obama a pussy laughing about how weak he is and how a real man would never negotiate like a girl in the meantime while negotiating obama orders an icecold assassination out on the open seas saves the day and brings one of those jerks in for a trialthe ignorance these people bring into the fray is bloody dangerous  its ignorant offensive and dangerous  theyre like toddlers playing with fire  theyre stuck in some political game as todays gross comments show and thats disconnected them from reality that sarah palin post really really upsets me i was expecting the comments to be filled with people calling her out on her offensiveness and explaining how wrong she was on multiple levels but instead its filled with comments like thanks for saying what most americans were thinkingit has over k likes truly sad  gtapparently president obama cant see egypt and libya from his house does she not understand we make fun of her for saying that gtits about time our president stood up for america and condemned these islamic extremists which is why thats exactly what obama did  oh god that sarah palin post ii just hate her theres no other way to put iti actually liked her facebook page a while ago the shame just so i could point out how batshit crazy she is i tried to make a similar but less eloquently put comment to yours a few hours ago but i seem to have been banned from commenting apparently the republican hivemind does not tolerate dissent im actually a little proudedit and the comments sweet mother of god i cant believe some of those people have enough common sense to put their socks on in the morningg let alone use a computer nice gathering of information i applaud you sir  i really donow that ive gotten that out of the way i really am sick and tired of statements likewe firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of othersand the embassy of the united states in cairo condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of muslims no enough with that crapno amount of offense should shift the condemnation from the real crime violence horror and threat those that act in such ways on behalf of their religion to either authors of books cartoons or otherwiseit is those that claim the right to commit violence in the name of their faith who has the answering to do why because nobody and nothing is above criticism and questioning enough with this bullshit nonsense about not standing up for our own values and enough with this invertebrate representation of what many of us stand and live forsorry im danish and was one of the people injured when some verminous scum decided that a cartoon was a valid reason that people like myself danish people were free game for what my country had doneso im biased i admit that but i still believed the same thing before that incident i understand your anger and i understand your feelings and in a perfect world none of this would be necessary unfortunately in the face of thousands of years of indoctrination i think its pretty obvious that such platitudes arent particularly meaningful to the people trying to keep their heads attached inside the embassyi mean they could stand on the balcony and say fuck it usa usa usa free speech bitches watch that youtube video and suck it muhammad and it would be totally within their us freespeech rights to do soi dont think itd be a very good idea but they couldi think the world is actually fairly quickly moving toward far greater tolerance and that religion will eventually go into global decline but in the meantime  man reading the comments on the sarah palin postmfw just curious how was that message tweeted being as long as it was was it linked somewhere edit not trying to be negative just want to have facts romney is despicable and this quote should be sharededit that explains it yeah i tried to explain that that the message was assembled from multiple tweets that happened over the course of a minute or two shes just a little person  by talking about her youve diminished yourself never too early to start indiscriminately smiting people fuck yeahalso i find efforts to offend believers of any and all religions hilarious yeah the efforts usually are hilarious i think we can mostly all agree unfortunately they dont always find it so funny and sometimes kill people because of it its less funny when people die at any rate showing a bit of respect for peoples sensibilities religious beliefs and culture is usually the right thing to do especially in the field of global relations gtremember embassies are administration my friendsi just watched the pbs newshour tonight where they had norm coleman former republican senator from minnesota and foreign policy advisor to romney and nicholas burns former us ambassador to nato and some countries under democratic and republican administrations he was on the show to defend the obama administration but he isnt part of the reelection campaign to discussdebate romneys criticism of obama burnss response to the assertion that obama is responsible for the embassy statement in question was that often embassies are in distant time zones and they have to issue statements while people in dc are asleepwhile im posting i would like to point out to romney et al that yes we have freedoms that we shouldnt have to apologize for but with rights come responsibilities although in this case i do believe that muslims should be as tolerant of the blasphemy of nonmuslims as members of other faiths are tolerant of blasphemy against theirs great breakdown  the blog post especially should be talked about on every single news network  it is just a complete lie and there is no way mitt can say it was taken out of context gt the statement of sympathy that romney is referring to came out before the attacks happened tweeted by a member of the us embassy in egypt not the administrationit wasnt merely tweeted it was the official statement of the us embassy and was posted on their website  also from an organizational point of view the embassy is a part of the state department which is part of the executive branch and therefore a part of the administration  of course i strongly disagree with the notion that obama had anything to do with the unfortunate statement and i hate that people so often project the actions of lowerlevel executive branch employees on to the president  but its technically correct that the statement is from the administrationgt it seems to me that this actual set of quotes from the embassy dont fit the narrative that romney is trying to speak tothe statement certainly does sympathize with the attackers in the sense that it sympathizes with their opinion that freedom of speech was abused to insult other religions  regardless if your opinion of romney it shouldnt be used as an excuse to defend a government statement advocating the rejection of the abuse of freedom of speech  i understand the need to placate the mob but it couldve been worded so much better well when you put it that way it does seem that romney isnt so much of an opportunist asshole dancing on the graves of american diplomats for political gainoh wait no it doesnt  technically correct the best kind of correctseriously though youre grasping at straws here the statement that freedom of speech was abused to insult religions isnt an offensive statement gtwe firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of otherswe are a country that celebrates tolerance and freedom of religion as well as diversity speaking out in an offensive and deliberately demeaning way against a people a race and a religion is against the core principles of our nation whats more the workers in this egyptian embassy were responding to a specific youtube video that was being protested one that is particularly offensive to muslims its a particularly hatefilled racist pile of trash have you actually seen the video they are talking about how about you go watch it real quickand i know its awfully hard to watch but seriously get to  mark when mohammad shows up that whole section is deliberately made to be as absolutely offensive as possible the embassy is saying they reject the actions not that they reject free speech they are saying that they do not support the views expressed in this rather insulting video and that americans in general do not believe in harming or belittling the religious beliefs of others that seems like a perfectly sensible thing to do especially when theres a mob of people outside screaming about it  gt youre grasping at straws herei was merely saying its technically correct that it came out of the administration as more of an fyi with regards to the structure of the executive branch  im not saying that romneys implication that obama had something to do with the statement is correct  thought that was cleargt speaking out in an offensive and deliberately demeaning way against a people a race and a religion is against the core principles of our nation i strongly disagree with that  being offensive is in line with the core principle of freedom of speech as nonoffensive speech doesnt need protection  we as a society do generally look down on such statements but i would not consider such statements as against some core legal principle of the united states as opposed to some moral norm american society holdsgt the embassy is saying they reject the actions not that they reject free speech they are saying that they do not support the views expressed in this rather insulting video and that americans in general do not believe in harming or belittling the religious beliefs of others that seems like a perfectly sensible thing to do especially when theres a mob of people outside screaming about itthat is a perfectly sensible thing to do  unfortunately that is not all they said  not only do they reject the message of the video which they should they also introduce the notion that freedom of speech can be abused implication there are limits to tolerated speech and such abuse should be rejected by the government  the latter part is an important distinction  this is similar to when maryland delegate burns asked the ravens to suppress ayanbadejos endorsement of samesex marriage  he tried to claim it was merely his individual opinion which he and anyone else is free to have but when youre speaking as a government official such words create extra import gtthe embassy of the united states in cairo condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of muslims  as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions today the th anniversary of the september   terrorist attacks on the united states americans are honoring our patriots and those who serve our nation as the fitting response to the enemies of democracy respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of american democracy we firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of othersgtclearly we have a fundamental disconnect in how we are reading this message can you point to the part where they say the government should reject the abuse of free speech to spew hatespeech they say right there that the right to free speech is universal they are simply saying that on a moral level not a legal one as you are so quick to point out these embassy workers reject the abuse of free speech to spew hatefilled bullcrap designed specifically to spread anger bigotry and violence nowhere does this statement call for any sort of reduction in free speech nowhere does it claim that the government should stop this sort of speech in the future in fact nowhere does the statement even specifically mention the government the embassy is condemning hatespeech targeted toward the muslim people a totally sensible position for the embassy to take gt clearly we have a fundamental disconnect in how we are reading this messageits clear you view it as merely the equivalent of an individual making the statement  i give added weight to the fact that its the government itself making such a statement much in the same way that i give added weight to the fact that maryland delegate burns in his official capacity as a delegate asked the ravens to stop their players from endorsing ssm  i dont simply treat it as one mans opinionmy point in all this is the embassy worded their statement in an unfortunate way as they couldve easily condemned the message without implying that there are limits to free speech  imagine youre an islamist who thinks the american government should ban religiously offensive movies  arent you going to be more convinced of the correctness of this view after reading the embassys statement especially since the embassy is itself a part of the american government i dont see a call to limit or ban free speech or offensive movies in the statement from the embassy i see a condemnation of hate speech but nowhere in that statement is a call for the ban of such speechhence the disconnect in how we are readinginterpreting the message the important thing here is not whats going on in egypt or libya or the administrations reaction to it and how they are handling the events and promises of more protests  the important thing here is what mitt romney said about all of it during his campaign well ive come to a conclusion about the whole thing mitt romney has two choices here come out and apologize hes jumped the gun here attributed quotes that were clearly not belonging to the administration and were said prior to any actual violence thus those quotes cannot on any possible timelinebased narrative be a first response to deaths that happened after the tweets were sent unless we are doing retroactive quoting here or someone owns a time machine  stand by his statementsnot issue any further statements on the issue in this instance its pretty clear he knows hes absolutely full of shit but that its totally ok because fox is going to spend the next  hours pumping the hell out of this story pretending obama is over there in the middle east giving handjobs to muslims while begging them not to attack our embassies and telling them he totally sympathizes with their plight in short romney knows the totally skewed message he was spewing will be properly relayed to his voter base truth be damned hes been running his whole campaign on blatant lies like the welfare work requirement lie so why would he retract the multiple statements based on the falsehood of the timing of the events  it would be very much out of character for him to appear to be influenced by reality like i said im glad the focus here is on the important stuff  what mitt romney and fox are saying about the current events in egypt and libya it is pretty important when a presidential candidate makes an ass of himself after a national tragedy whats your point i guess my point is that i care much more about what is actually going on in egypt and libya than what a political candidate is saying about it  since people are dying there appears to be coordination and calls for future attacks since we were directly involved in strikes in one of those countries and indirectly supported the removal of the leader of another id like to know how the administration is addressing those aspects of our foreign policy to maybe mitigate some of the damage    im also really scared about people now talking about the fact that this could be blamed on a movie or a koran burning and that maybe we should have antiblasphemy laws to keep people from speaking out about islam  i guess i could give fuckall about what mitt romney or fox news or sarah palin people are still paying attention to her have to say about any of thisi dont see how a presidential candidates response is even relevant because what they say on the campaign trail regarding foreign policy is going to be much different than what they actually do once in office because of the realities of the position  see guantanamo drone strikes ndaa rendition wiretapping etc if youre looking for examples of how a candidates words mean nothing when campaigning  but i would grant you that talking shit about mitt romney is more fun than actually thinking about the shitstorm going on over there ok wait i cant even get through your whole postnobody is calling for antiblaspheme laws nobody i dont care what fox news is telling you its not happening obamas not going to take away your right to be a total douchwad to people with different beliefs and skin tones what matters here is romney decided to go stand on top of a dead guys still warm body to grandstand about something that is totally bullshit that matters thats what were talking about hereif you want to talk about the actual events going on in libya and egypt go seek out a conversation specifically regarding those things if you want to speak about how the government is about to limit free speech as a result of this action go to wwwfoxcom and pick any discussion thread off their front page but recognize that its a conversation based on pure fantasy from your comment i would say the important thing for you is running interference for romneyoh and several americans died btwnot that it matters to you i just thought youd like to know gtoh and several americans died btwnot that it matters to you i just thought youd like to knowactually thats my point  several americans died and the conversation voted to the frontpage from politics is about mitt romney who has fuck all to do with any of this stuff  he made a political statement on the campaign trail about how he would do things better than the incumbent  so crazy  meanwhile we have a current state department a current president and what looks to be a huge problem  and the guy i responded to is quoting what sarah palin has to say about it  greatgti would say the important thing for you is running interference for romneyso because i dont give a fuck what romney says on the campaign trail about an issue he has absolutely no control over and hopefully never will im running interference for him  if i dont precede my comment with something like i hate romney but then i must be an apologist for him  its interesting to me that you project that on to my comment  is discussing the events in libya and egypt in the context of how the current administration is handling them somehow running interference for romney hes such a piece of shit ive been doing my best to try and give him a fair shake but this is the last straw exploiting the deaths of americans like this to try and attack obama is a new low youre allowed to give someone a fair shake but also criticize them fair shake doesnt have to mean remain neutral all the time well what i mean is that i try to ignore my political biases i tend to lean left and consider myself a moderate progressive when i see a political thread and not immediately assume that romney is lying or disingenuous with political threads i try to always make sure to read the comments before updownvoting the main story making my own comments etc because i find that most of the time theres a lot more to the story than the headline but its getting harder and harder to see a thread about romney and not immediately assume hes a lying douchebag who will do or say anything no matter how tasteless or untrue to gain an advantage well its good that you try to keep an open mind but yes at this point i think we can safely say that romney is er not the most honest political candidate on the block  you read the comments wouldnt it be better to read the article itself and if you feel so inclined go read a second article with a different point of view i just think if you go to the comment section of reddit you will read a typically heavy biased point of view i do both but i find that if you read the comments ahead of time especially if the title of the post seems unbelievable you can usually get a more detailed rational discussion he had a much better shot if he had stayed with his true moderateliberal positions he never would of won the primary but romney is not this hardcore conservative he is trying to be and thats why he looks fake its not really him maybe he actually cares that americans died and is offended that obama apologized to the people who killed them  obama did not apologize to the people who killed them if you think that can you explain why who is it that told you this do you even know what this is about obama didnt apologize to the people who killed these americans romneys campaign lied about that sounds like you didnt get the memo hes grasping at straws he has seen the polls and knows that his chances of winning are rapidly fading so hes taking a gamble that this moment will turn on obama enough to swing the tide it wont work and hes a dick for trying but he doesnt have any other options at this point  i would rather lose with dignity than fight like that  i guess thats why im not in politics i keep waiting for conservative but sane mormons to come out against romneys pathetic reliance on lies  he is the most prominent mormon in america currently and his desperate selfimmolation isnt good for their overall pr   sane mormons you have to pay  of your salary to go to church on a sunday there is no sanity in it lets not call this election too early it might lead to voter complacency  the eternal irony of voter polls if they show one candidate winning people start to assume that candidate will win and dont bother voting selffulfilling prophecies  yeah idk about that  rasmussen polls has romney winning by  when people who are undecided but lean towards one candidate are considered     rasmussen polls are historically rightleaning look at the aggregate polls instead of a sample size of one also look at swing state polling   as we all learned in  you dont become president based on the national vote you become president thanks to the judges your father app er i mean you become president based on the electoral college rasmussen is not accurate and takes way too many implications that benefit conservatism  also that survey only measures popular vote  the latest compiled dataactually shows obama up by about  points in the electoral college  i feel like that clinton speech put the nail in the coffin  ever since then people have realized that the republicans have lost their way and you dont have to take their shit anymore  the people realized its ok to side with the sane candidate  i know its been said before but mitt romney isnt human  he looks human and he tries to act human but he is in no way a human being  hes a smiling mockery of a person a grim puppet for his mastershe will do and say anything to appease his benefactors its his only purpose the t preceeded the t line they had rubber skin you could spot them easier the t is a cybernetic organism living skin on a metal exoskeleton mitt romney is a t the republicans have robots  i knew about the repubnets sarah palin mission but mitt romney is a new threat altogether true   but wouldnt that be an endoskeleton you got me my mistake  he was assembled out of spare parts from dead presidents  he has the business acumen of herbert hoover the grace of gerald ford the integrity of warren g harding and the openness of richard nixon my godits a perfect storm of failed policy and political blundering all in one kinda like data from star trek data wasnt human but he was a person with his own personality  he had hopes and dreams just not emotion well eventually he got emotions  he did what he thought was necessary even arguing against ordersmitt romney is a puppet desperate to dance to his masters tune fucking hell scientology is right hes probably one of the lizard people from outer space im pretty certain he is a robot running on some computer program based on his long stream of gaffes i can only assume hes running on windows me gtwindows methis explains so much to be fair he has to do and say anything because he was not a great choice for the republican party considering how far right it has become  hes had to spend almost the entire election cycle erasing his past as governor and trying to appeal to the tea party types has to in order to be elected under the republican banner and yeah the republicans have jack as choice  their time is over maybe in a decade or two they might make a come back yep  a decade or two at bestyou know youre in trouble when the other side cant stand you and you also have to change your entire self to appeal to your own baseedit  its going to be ugly for the republicans  i predict obama in a landslide and im not a particularly partisan individual sometimes i wonder what would happen if romney won the presidency like bush did yeah thats totally it  mitt romney isnt a human  couldnt believe i didnt think of that before  glad to see educated redditors on here gt mitt romney isnt a humanfiguratively speaking he has no humanity and any he shows is punished by his puppet mastersgtglad to see educated redditors on herehuh i wonder how long he waiting to posthumously convert chris stevens to mormonism so uh chris  i heard you like wearing funny underwear  you knowus mormons wear funny underwear all the timeinterested do they even wait until youre dead anymore theyre supposed to wait a year and only family members are supposed to submit names for proxy baptism proxy marriage proxy endowments etcbut theres not really much enforcementhitlers had his work done several times cause materially distinct christ knows you have to save hitler fuck judas though right  judas would have already been baptized into christs church according to mormon thinking you only get one legitimate christauthorized baptism in life with few exceptions excommunicated mormons can sometimes be rebaptized if their leaders think theyre worthy enough mormons will baptize converts from other sects of christianity because they dont believe any other church has the authority to baptizejudas was unlucky that he had been given more knowledge the more you knowingly reject the worse off you are at judgement heyyoo can you just fucking imagine if  happened on obamas watch  shutter shudder i just did  at my spelling its ok there would have been shutters too lots of cameras and pictures taken actually you will find that obama was an illinois senator from  to  meaning that obama was present in america at the time  occurred meaning he could have easily prevented it what if obama came to america became a senator and served for  years to carry out the plan of destroying the twin towers of course he was behind it the whole time in fact he probably orchestrated the recent mass shootings too hes destroying america from the inside out google that i bet some nutjob has that theory state senator no that son of a bitch im pretty sure that if you took a poll on whether obama is to blame for  the usual suspects will answer yes he probably would have had osama taken out immediately instead of allowing him to escape into pakistan while under our watch we wouldnt have gone into iraq and wed probably be out of afghanistan by now as well  since  happened less than eight months into dubyas presidency there was no shortage of republicans who blamed clinton island youre late  ive already been schooled what kind of a presidential candidate would pass up a chance to criticize obamas travels through time and space apologizing for america and why does he own the arab spring now i mean i had my own questions that it was spurred by the cia but seeing what governments have taken over i dont think thats the directon we wantedalso conservatives were taking credit for the arab spring calling george w bush prophetic for saying he was kaying the seeds for democracy in the middle east which all countries there would soon want so by their logic bush owns the arab spring but we know logic doesnt work with the fake conservative patriot americans he doesnt own the arab spring now  if hes reelected though next february he will go back in time and take possession of it and conservatives know this i dont even understand how apologizing for americans would be a bad thing in this situation if i were a family member of one of the  for example i would want the american embassy to apologize left and right for the bigots in america if it would save lives i had a guy on twitter say so you agree we should apologize to muslims for offending them im like yeah offending people is badthe embassy was pretty solid about the whole thing they said they approve tolerance for religions but could condemn things they stuck to that even when some people were telling them to force the movie to be stopped or asking why there werent religious laws to prevent it in the first placeromney misstepped because he misunderstood the information the timing and then spoke in such a way that now his followers are saying obama is a muslim supporter on  if its unintentional its tragic if its intentional its malicious why do people think they hate us what they are just so jealous of our lifestyle and values no we put bases in their countries bomb them kill innocents whose brothers turn into the terrorists we owe them some apologies hearts and minds i cant believe i am not seeing this point being made more well he was in private equity hes a pro at exploiting others for personal gain does anyone have a link to the original statement from the embassy i spent the better part of an hour trying to find it ampnbsp edit found it  well the all powerful romney if caught in that situation would have hung his ass out the window with an american flag painted on it chanting usa usa usa usa and still people will blindly vote for him the embassy people are controlled by obama  he either told the what to say or he supports their message  this argument as retarded as anything that would come from bill mahers mouth hey romney said that the people at the egyptian embassy are part of the obama administration thus its obamas fault apparently to the gop obama is a massive  headed hydra and each foreign ambassador is an extension of his being so its only fair you cant beat that logic and on another note how awesome would it be if our president was a  headed hydra whats worse now that romney knows that he says that the embassy is the administration so obamas fault anyway regardless of reality or other issues thank you nobody knew there was a death until afterwards stop lying  oh well in that case his response seems totally appropriate s being apologetic didnt diffuse the situation it makes us look weak and strengthens their resolve muslim culture isnt like western culture they have more of a survival of the strongest mentality if you were in prison and an inmate intentionally bumped you apologizing to him makes you look week your best bet would be to throw down and fight him right there win or lose it gives you a better chance of others not messing with you kind of a weird analogy but its valid obamas administration has been sympathetic and apologetic since day one does anyone really think this would have happened on ws watch it might have but our response would have been completely different muslims will never love the us they hate israel too much if we want respect well have to make them fear us its what savages understand ok before you grab the pitchforksthe embassy is not allowed to make statements without approval from the white house via transcriptnot saying i agreedont agree with the statement just trying to stop misinformation gtmitt romney saw a dead americandrama major romneys statement was released hours before the embassy killing mitt romney only reacted the right way it would be the wrong decision to throw all our ideals of free speech away  also when the free speech is a shitty video  only because some muslim feel offended and yes of course it is throwing away our ideals of free speech if we say sorry for the practise of free speech thats not how free speech works free speech is a legal right doesnt mean anything you say isnt above an apology and even if an apology isnt warranted it doesnt mean were throwing away our ideals if we give one gt wasnt even made by obama himself it was made by people inside the embassygt it happened before the embassy was attackedand this tweetwas whenlook i get the point that embassy statements arent exactly obama standing up at the podium but it seems like dozens of comments here and in the  other rpolitics threads are disavowing any and all connection to obama and his administration and campaign and accusing romney of just plain lying yeah if the actual embassies in relevant countries directly selected appointed and controlled by the dept of state  foreign service  us sec state  potus dont represent obamas middle east policies just maybe a little bit then what does exactlyrpolitics doth protest too much methinkslets face it the foreign service blew it big time here due to incompetence or politically correct blinders werent remotely aware of the situation they are dealing with in libya and ended up getting an ambassador into a shitty unprotected consulate on  anniversary where he and others got lynched seriously if you cant even comprehend the sort of level of security us personnel requires at all time in a place as wildly unstable as libya wtf good are you and who appointed your incompetent ass to a diplomatic mission spoiler obama did fox news this day well they played  tapes the morning then offhand remarks muslims which opened the door to obama god speeches etc even day that supposed to left politics they manage to cunts the biggest security failure in the history of the us was under a republican george w bush relevantgtthat is unless it was read in conjunction with the daily briefs preceding aug  the ones the bush administration would not release while those documents are still not public i have read excerpts from many of them along with other recently declassified records and come to an inescapable conclusion the administrations reaction to what mr bush was told in the weeks before that infamous briefing reflected significantly more negligence than has been disclosed in other words the aug  document for all of the controversy it provoked is not nearly as shocking as the briefs that came before it  the direct warnings to mr bush about the possibility of a qaeda attack began in the spring of  by may  the central intelligence agency told the white house of a report that a group presently in the united states was planning a terrorist operation weeks later on june  the daily brief reported that qaeda strikes could be imminent although intelligence suggested the time frame was flexible i know it was mentioned but i cannot imagine if obama had been at the helm during  would everyone had came together like they did sadly i think we wouldve seen some assasination attempts okay heres where you all stop thinking and pretend its all bushs faultwhat would you have done differently they had information stating that there could be an attack but how does that correlate to theyre going to take over several planes on september   at these locations and times please be ready for it having knowledge of the possibility of something doesnt give you the ability to prevent it to your question id have looked into itmy understanding is that the cia bent over backwards trying to convince the administration this was a serious issue and needed attention and the administration said that it was a distraction from the real threat iraqi remember when i first heard people blaming the us government for not stopping the attack i thought that was ridiculous because how could they have known that would happen however when i learned how much our intelligence agency did know i was blown away by their effectiveness and gravely disappointed in the way that information was handledif the administration hadnt had a predetermined agenda if they had been open to new ideas and information i think there is a good chance they could have given the cia the resources and directive to follow up and possibly stop  its not sure they could have but the fact that they were essentially told not to bother was a terrible terrible mistake if they hadnt cancelled clintons investigation into alqueda i really want to read up on this like now linklinkcant find the bit about bush cancelling the investigation but i recall it being one of the things he did shortly after taking office watch foxs interview with clinton  its available in  parts on youtubeheres part one i havent done any actual reading up on it just been too busy lately but the interview is worth a watch im in no way a conspiracy theorist but i believe they may have used the immanent attacks as a way to propel public support toward their end game  iraq  its been said that fdr was aware of the attacks on pearl harbor and used it to allow us to go into wwii a war that the vast majority of americans were againstuntil ph   kinda like how romney is using this attack to propel his agenda except that will never work attacks against the nation steel the people behind their leader for a contemporary example before  bush jr was almost assured a one term presidency based on the scelection fiasco yet after the attack his approval was almost perfect not generally against that leader and even then this is so minor comparatively i dont expect much of a blip if any from it youre correct in that it is not all bushs fault and that knowledge of a possible attack does not do much when you have no information about the date or method however based on these briefings did the administration do anything to try to figure this information out based on the link to which you responded i would say no this definitely means the administration is at least partially culpable if you have evidence to the contrary please provide  youre making a valuable point here  but according to national security sources they knew there was a high possibility of attacks yesterday  i think the bush administration is at least partially culpable but then you have to concede the same about the current administration and this incident because the bush administration essentially ignored all these warnings they did nothing in the way of stepping up security in the us they did not come up with any plans to go after these terrrorists that were in the us they made no efforts to stop this from happening instead they called for deeper analysis same articlegtbut some in the administration considered the warning to be just bluster an intelligence official and a member of the bush administration both told me in interviews that the neoconservative leaders who had recently assumed power at the pentagon were warning the white house that the cia had been fooledgtthe us is not the target of a disinformation campaign by usama bin laden the daily brief of june  read using the governments transliteration of bin ladens first name going on for more than a page the document recited much of the evidence including an interview that month with a middle eastern journalist in which bin laden aides warned of a coming attack as well as competitive pressures that the terrorist leader was feeling given the number of islamists being recruited for the separatist russian region of chechnyagtyet the white house failed to take significant action officials at the counterterrorism center of the cia grew apoplectic on july  at a meeting of the counterterrorism group one official suggested that the staff put in for a transfer so that somebody else would be responsible when the attack took place two people who were there told me in interviews the suggestion was batted down they said because there would be no time to train anyone else im guessing youre probably the same kind of person who thinks that stepping up security would be an invasion of your civil rights   stepping up security in the us as in put the fbi on high alert mobilize counter terrror units to try infiltrate the terrrorist groups check backgrounds etc  deleted they didnt so much follow warnings on iraq as create warnings on iraq what warnings on iraq the wmds that never existed there the yellow cake uranium story that was complete bullshit the informant curveball who made everything up in exchange for money and safety president bush is told there are going to be attacks on us soil and he wants more info president bush is told sadam hussein bought ammonia and he wants to go to war he does not wait for more informationand if he had he would have learned that all the previous information was bullshit the only thing we were warned about in regards to iraq was that wed find no wmd once we got there    it was decided back in the s that they wanted to invade iraq and remove hussain from power  what warnings they made up some evidence to justify an invasion gtthey ignore warnings made by the cia and other reputable intelligence sources bad on themgtthey follow fabricated and exaggerated evidence from nonreputable intelligence sources like ahmed chalabi and the iraqi national congress an antisaddam interest group bad on themftfy gtwhat would you have done differentlyinteresting pointthe main theme of the article that was linked was that the intelligence community was trying desperately to get the white house to even recognize that there was an imminent threatmaybe the wh could have asked the cia if they had identified any of the members of the group maybe they ask if they may know the whereabouts of any members of the groupmaybe they could have just said man this seems serious lets get fbi director in here and see if theyve been hearing any domestic chatter regarding attacks or plans to attack recentlyto over simplify they could have done somethinganything instead of doing nothing even if they failed to thwart the attacks you would like to think that repeated warnings of an imminent attack would garner some kind of actionaccording to the article they completely disregarded these multiple warningsgtbut some in the administration considered the warning to be just bluster an intelligence official and a member of the bush administration both told me in interviews that the neoconservative leaders who had recently assumed power at the pentagon were warning the white house that the cia had been fooled so instead of saying well we think that were still going to have the fbi look into it they followed the advice that matched up with their preexisting plansgtaccording to this theory bin laden was merely pretending to be planning an attack to distract the administration from saddam hussein whom the neoconservatives saw as a greater threat intelligence officials these sources said protested that the idea of bin laden an islamic fundamentalist conspiring with mr hussein an iraqi secularist was ridiculous but the neoconservatives suspicions were nevertheless carrying the daythe cia even back then was saying that it was ridiculous that bin laden and saddam hussein were conspiring togetherthe wh and pentagon wanted a war in iraq and they were going to ignore anything that could possibly lead to them not having a war in iraq therefore they did nothing to investigate these reports instead of doing something a very important component of what was going on the the minds of bush administration officials was the minset that only nation states were important  a global terrorist organization like al qaeda which wasnt linked to or run by any particular nation simply didnt fit into how they saw the world working so it was difficult to convince them of the threat  one of the main offenders was dr rice who was a soviet specialist  throughout her life education and professional experience all the actors in the world were either nationstates themselves or direct proxiesthe other element that they struggled with was the fact that to whatever small degree al qaeda was linked to any particular nation that nation was saudi arabia  bush cheney rumsfeld rice and others all had professional and personal experience in the oil industry where saudis are important players  bush himself has many saudi personal friends  the fact that one of the main threats to our security was a saudifunded group which was made up of many saudis was hard to reconcilethese facts were both part of why they had a hard time recognizing the severity of the threat posed by al qaeda and why even after  they focused on the absurd idea that iraqsaddam hussein had anything to do with the attacks  when you only see nationstateactors and you are friendly to saudi arabia the main regional opponent of saudi arabia sure looks like a good targetthis doesnt make the success of the sept   attacks exclusively or even primarily the fault of the bush administration but it certainly points out some of their limitations which contributed to the problem ill have to say that i agree with you on several points while disagreeing with you on othersi can agree that quite a few people having come of age during the cold war era and because of some of their relationships may have had some blinds spots regarding saudi arabia and al qaedawhat i disagree with is your opinion on the administration and iraq it wasnt their inability to comprehend nonnationstate groups as being dangerous that caused them to focus on iraq after  they were focused on iraq when they walked in the door in january  they wanted to depose saddam hussein from the very beginning of the administrationthats the key to passage i highlighted in the article where they said the reason they did not think the intelligence was credible was that they thought that bin laden was trying to trick the cia into distracting them from the real threat of saddam husseinthat occurred because when bush took office the majority of his administration   including pentagon officials  wanted regime change in iraq they wanted to finish what they thought george hw bush left unfinished back in  they had a singular focus and they were not going to let themselves get sidetracked by reportsof course  did eventually end up sidetracking them but only temporarily the bush administration would have invaded iraq whether  happened or not it was their policy from the beginningthis comes not just from the linked article its stuff ive read over the course of the years this article does seems agree with and tie together all of these other scattered reports regarding the bush administration  and iraqpersonally i think that this is people trying to save their own reputations of that whole fiasco that was the bush administration now that time has passed and theres not much political cost for speaking out against the bush administrationtheyre all coming out of the woodwork to say it wasnt me i was one of the people that was trying to tell them what they were doing was wrongim glad the real story is getting out however anybody that is speaking out now instead of when it could have really made a difference is a fucking coward and not worthy of having a good reputation did you read the article i linked to your argument would be much more credible if they hadnt invaded used  as an excuse to attack iraq  that is what they wanted to do from the beginning  alert after alert was given to the bush administration and they did nothing  they discounted the information and focused on iraq  just like after  their first response was to find a way to link saddam to the attacks according to richard clarke  the presidency should be above being used as a pawn in a game to get the guy you think insulted your daddy   you dont need to know exactly when an attack will come to heighten security at the very least you could do thinking something like this  in the past terrorists have taken over planes  normally they want money or to make a political statement  but the memo clearly states that osama intends to attack the us in the past they have bombed buildings and killed people  so create a security brief for all pilots and airlines letting them know that if a terrorist takes over a plane they may intend to kill the people so establish a new policy that states that you dont just give in to terrorist demands you try to stop themit still could have been a tragedy in all probability some or all of the people on the planes would die when they resisted but a clear directive do not give in to terrorist demands and do not allow them to control the plane would have probably saved thousands of livesi realize this is all  hindsight or whatever but the truth is the problem wasnt that bush took these notes seriously and there wasnt a clear plan of action the problem was that bush gave two shits about the memos and kept emphasizing that they were a distraction from the real threat of saddam husseintheres like zero doubt in my mind that gore or mccain would have handled the situation far differently its certainly not entirely bushs fault that would be absurd however his administrations response to this information was woefully negligent  the part that they are responsible for is how it was handledthey did nothing to clean house before the attack which can be understood given the context of crappy intelligencehowever their immediate response was to go into another nation and absolutely destroy it then they used the same type crappy intelligence to go to war with an entirely unrelated nationto go back to bushs line fool me once  we cant say well our intelligence pre was bad so its not bushs fault without also saying well obviously our post intelligence was of similar quality so we should blame bush for making expensive both monetary and cost of life long term decisions based on the same perhaps they couldnt stop it but history needs to be set straight with fact  the bush administration lied about how much information they had  and then used that lie to increase governmental control and surveillance   so theyre still shitty whether the attack is their fault or not bush claims to have prevented numerous attacks  bush himself says that the president can do something to prevent these events he personally claims to have done just thatbut when he got the various bin laden memos piecing together an event that wound up being   he notably did absolutely nothingthe record shows he ignored the problem  in fact he took more vacation days in his first year of presidency than any other president in history  at the time he was a parttime president and also dont forget that the military intelligence was reporting that aq was just trying to get a reaction and that the reports of possible attacks were a combination of misinformation and bad analysis bush was given two explanations for the data and very unfortunately chose the wrong one  the right information was coming from the fucking cia the wrong information was not coming from us intelligence services why do we have intelligence networks if youre just going to ignore the information the thing is that the us doesnt have an intelligence network it has a number of different departments whose major purview is international intelligence the big three are cia nsa and dia and there are many many other departments who arent concerned primarily with intelligence but get a hold of it through their everyday operations state department and fbi spring to mind but there are others all of these organizations especially the first three are in the midst of a constant interdepartmental conflict for influence budget power jurisdiction etc its a classic example of what happens when you have overlapping bureaucratic departments they fight for turf because of this often the different intelligence briefings and analyses are contradictory or even directly opposing and its up to the decision makers in this case bush to weigh the argument and data from the different organizations and decide which analysis is correct even without the competition and infighting any three organizations who have different methodologies access to different information and different institutional skills will often disagree even when analyzing the same situation each department will look at things through their own operational lens which colors any analysis the cia isnt the only voice in the intelligence community and much of the time it isnt even the loudest ive only see that the cia and bushs national security adviser were explicitly outlining a possible attack ive never read that there was any reputable conflicting intelligencecite me the source that shows a us intelligence department saying aq was just trying to get a reaction and that the reports of possible attacks were a combination of misinformation and bad analysis gti suggest anyone who is interested in this topic to research project for a new american century pnac of which donald rumsfeld and dick cheney among other prominent neoconservatives are members they released an official memo in  that said our focus needs to be getting saddam out of power and that this would likely take a very long time unless there was some sort of event that would galvanize the american people i believe the exact language they used was a new pearl harbor that could be used to convince people we needed to send military to iraq to get rid of saddams regimethey didnt just know about it they wanted it also check out fbi agent harry samit he suspected he had found someone who was plotting to hijack an airplane to use in a terrorist attack because the flight instructor contacted him about a suspicious guy who only wanted to learn how to fly the plane but wasnt concerned with learning how to land one this seems almost cartoonish but is precisely what happened agent samit was denied a search warrant to search the suspected terrorists computer over  times after reviewing this and many other pieces of evidence had to write a  page research paper on the topic my conclusion is that is superiors knew about it and didnt want him to foil the plot since they were going to use it as a way to convince people we needed to get saddamtldr  pnac cheney rumsfeld are on record in  wanting there to be a successful terror attack against the united states and fbi agent samit figured out there would be a hijacking terror attack and was blocked from doing anything about it by his superiorsfrom user actiongroup in another thread there is very clear evidence that not only did bush administration know about the attacks they did not want to stop them really even fox news indicated yesterday the bush administration refused to acknowledge the cias warningsit isnt a coincidence a lot of those documents remain top secret and not divulged to the american people it indicates an unmitigated level of arrogance and complete disregard of the information gathered by the intelligence community i dont understand this response  no enemy gives up the date time and location of an attack and therefore no one should expect to get that information beforehand  thats what condi rice said in congressional testimony but no one told us we needed to do anything  arent the people in charge supposed to be the ones telling other people what to do  like clinton did during the millennium when his administrations key staff were on high alert  and guess what the millennium bomber was caught by an alert border guard  not saying clinton made that happen but success has many fathersbush should have taken strong precautions high alerts to the faa fbi nsa etc  surely you have heard there was a lot of data around at the time that could have given some clues to a dedicated task force  but bush was pretty much a hands off president at this time remember the month of august in texas  lets be honest it is hard work to be president as he so eloquently put it laterno one can expect him or anyone to catch something this and thwart it but it would have been nice to see all the efforts they put in to try and stop it and those were sorely lacking by an overconfident administration crippled by hubris   fucking unorthodox opinion hipster  youre not enlightened because you have a wrong opinion youre just wrong i have doubts that bush et al could have really stopped it or indeed anyone  but they didnt even try even when being warned about possible attacks  read richard  clarkes book against all enemies inside americas war on terror  he recounts first hand what occurred in the white house before  and how the administration dropped the ball  gtwhat would you have done differentlyi would have listened to my national security advisers and intelligence agencies telling me that cell groups were active in the united states they were linked to al qaeda an attack was imminent hijacking was widely discussed among the terrorists being monitored by the ciaperhaps i would have also paid more attention to the infamous bin laden determined to attack inside the united states memo put on bushs desk august th  nice comment what was your reaction when you were watching fox news and they preached the same thing about obama to millions of viewers  hours a day on national television bush prioritized iraq instead of osama  his whole policy was to take down saddamwhat would i have done differently  listened to clinton when he left office and told bush osama was a big threat a temporary increase in air marshalls couldve gone far deleted bush was receiving memos and information for months about a cell forming in the us al qaeda possibly hijacking planes and an attack being imminent how exactly was  a totally unexpected turn of events deleted gtim sorry that my comment pissed you off for some reasonlolwutyoure so hung up on the fact that he wasnt given the specifics of the time and place of the attack intelligence rarely if ever does that intelligence is generally exactly what bush was given these are the things the bush administration was aware of al qaeda is planning a major us attack terror cells are active in the united states planning and preparing an attack plans to hijack planes and use them as missiles have been made by al qaeda increased chatter between cells and terrorist means that an attack is imminent on august th  a memo was placed on president bushs desk entitled bin laden determined to strike in us it included this phrase fbi information indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attackthe bush administration ignored the cias warnings which frustrated them most notably richard clarke bushs national security advisor heres the crux of the issue if bush would have taken these warnings seriously and attempted to take counter terrorist measures and the attack succeeded i would not fault him if he received coherent reputable intelligence and acted on it in a reasonable manner but ultimately failed i would not fault him for  given the difficulty terrorism poses however bush ignored the warnings his administration did not take them seriously and  americans died so was the attack a totally unexpected turn of events ill let the  commission reportanswer for me gtthe  attacks were a shock but they should not have come as a surprise islamic extremists had given plenty of warnings that they meant to kill americans indiscriminately and in large numbersgtduring the spring and summer of  us intelligence agencies received a stream of warnings about an attack al qaeda planned as one report puts it something very very very big director of central intelligence george tenet told us the system was blinking red exactly however its easier for these liberals to just blame bush  i think its just a lot easier for us to read the administration and condelleza rices remarks made at the  commission and then compare them with the mountains of evidence and testimony that refutes themfor us facts are easier to ascertain than spin and the person in charge of national security was promoted sup there ms rice dont forget goodjob browniethe guy congratulated for making a major fumble although a great example of utter incompetence and hubris from bushco brownie had nothing to do with  that was the katrina cockup youre thinking of i know there were so many its hard to keep them all straight no where in my post did i refer to  but rather to people in that administration who were rewarded for failure my mistake just going by the context of the thread but yeah bush was a disaster in nearly every way wouldnt pearl harbor be bigger in cost of life  was larger than pearl what if we factor in the unpopular war that the us government then dragged us into sarcasmin reference to wwii people know your history well if you consider the consequences americas involvement in wwii was more costly in terms of soldier and civilian lives compared to the involvement even in iraq and afghanistan wasnt it not to mention that it brought about the nuclear age and pearl harbor pulled the us into the waras somebody who saw  happen im not trying to downplay how significant it was but pearl harbor was as significant when you consider the chain reaction it set off its easier for us to forget or downplay it because presumably most of reddits userbase was not alive for pearl harbor but was alive for  we arent even done with all of the repercussions of  yet so its unfair to compare  years of history post ph to  years post  were still spending billions a day for the war and tsa and homeland security and the war on terror if we havent outspent wwii yet we will soonwwii united this country and brought us out of the depression  helped put us into a depression and the war it caused has done more to divide this country than vietnam didhowever we are talking about specific security failures not their impact on all of history there has to be some direct metric to compare them with loss of life is the only thing i could think of i um i was not talking about monetary cost and frankly have no concern for monetary cost when weighed against human cost look at the human cost of those living in those war zones the numbers are there its just that were killing badlyuntrained insurgents with no ability to fully centralize their strategic positions this is terminator vs caveman i agree theyre both significant but from a social and political standpoint  was a much more earthshattering incident pearl harbor was an act of war on military personnel and assets  changed the life of every american born thereafter we could be targeted by foreign agents in massive numbers during our everyday lives its something new to americans though many people have dealt with it for decades in other parts of the world i think thats where the difference lies in ensuring the security of the public its a subjective argument to try and say which was a bigger security breachtheres an arguable difference between less than a hundred guys planning to hijack some planes and the military and diplomatic core of a world power nefariously plotting to make a strategic military strike  if you go by strictly casualties  people died on  whereas  died on   pearl harbor did lose a great deal of material worth so to speak but it actually worked out in the end since it opened the door for new equipment  and we kind of knew that pearl harbor was very vulnerable to an attack from japan and such an attack would be rather costly we just didnt consider it a possibility gt and we kind of knew that pearl harbor was very vulnerable to an attack from japan and such an attack would be rather costly we just didnt consider it a possibilitythe same could be said about the wtc revulnerability it had been deliberately attacked well an attempt was made less than  years before  and its been reported that the govt had vague intelligence that suggested terrorists were planning to attack an american landmark hindsight is  of course but its kind of eerie how similar the events were the main difference being that pearl harbor happened in the context of an ongoing war while  was an unprovoked peacetime attack on us soil no im not a  truther but i am a firm believer that history repeats itself by what measuretechnology amp intel availableimmediate death tollfinancial market falloutduration and cost of ensuing military actions i was mostly thinking that failing to detect the entire japanese navy was a bigger fuckup than failing to detect a terrorist cell i guess all the satellites malfunctioned did you ever think the us wanted to enter the war of course they did no such thing as manmade satellites in   if the us wanted a reason to enter the war they wouldnt need to be attacked with their pants down just attacked no satellites then why didnt they just use email to warn them this is an unfounded correlation but the us has a record of taking military action after an attack on a naval body especially in the earlier th century the maine got us into the spanish american war the lusitania into world war i and pearl harbor dragged us into world war ii from the history classes that ive taken it seems like the united states tends to retaliate into war as opposed to making the first strike even if it would be advantageous to enter the conflict  whichever one make the gop look worse thats the spirit yes i think so in terms of loss of life no  more died on sept th furthermore the overwhelming majority of deaths were military while its still horrible combat deaths of us servicemen during a battle is expected we also were forced to rely more on aircraft carriers in the pacific theater which ended up being a big strategic boon  in that sense our materiel losses were not terribly significant probably but fdr was a democrat and they dont make mistakes  i know this you know this and they know this republicans know this everyone knows thiswhether they believe it or not is another matter knowing something as fact  having to believe it im not saying that its logical to think that way but as we have come to know plenty of people choose to believe the propaganda of the gop and fox news knowing full well that its not true i really dont understand it i just cant grasp how somebody can look at bona fide demonstrable facts and choose an alternate reality this whole postfactual thing needs to go away well now you understand why religion exists get bit or at least take your shit to ratheism ah religion the only thing you can irrationally believe in and have an expectation that everyone will respect your belief to the point where they are expected to pretend it is valid i make fun of people that believe in ghosts too hurts doesnt it   i tend to take my shit to the toilet i dont know what you religious folks do with yours probably worship it or something gt mans unfailing capacity to believe what he prefers to be true rather than what the evidence shows to be likely and possible has always astounded me we long for a caring universe which will save us from our childish mistakes and in the face of mountains of evidence to the contrary we will pin all our hopes on the slimmest of doubts god has not been proven not to exist therefore he must existgt   academician prokhor zakharov for i have tasted the fruitgt sid meiers alpha centauri

you get cutscenes with bits like this  there are many great ones in the game and this was  before the terrorist attacks and security crackdowns god and religion are two completely different things you realize that people on the other side say the exact same thing  they are as certain of the facts as you are yes but theres a difference to be had in such situations take evolution for example people can be either for or against it but in the end only one of them has empirical evidence to back their claims one can be as certain of something as humanly possible but if that certainty flies in the face of verifiable reality then that certain fact is worthless people are entitled to their own opinions but not their own facts gtpeople are entitled to their own opinions but not their own factsdefinitely  the trouble is that politics however much people want to claim otherwise is based mostly on opinions  im saying if you go over to a major conservative blog they have the exact same discussions and believe it or not will cite evidence for their claims in the same way that more intelligent people on this subreddit do  they generally have a different opinion in the context of the same factspolitics is hardly a hard science so i dont see the comparison to evolution as completely applicable  you cant claim that the nuances of foreign policy and differences of opinion about how it should be handled are the same thing as anything that can be verified by empirical evidence perhaps i should have clarified my position i wasnt trying to imply that i think my political views are anywhere near as verifiable as to continue the example evolution what i meant was that there seems to be a developing habit amongst some of the population where a claim will be made that is demonstrably false say mitt romneys recent claim that obama sympathized with the rioters in libya who killed four american diplomats or the romney camps bogus claimthat obama ended the work requirement for welfare claims like this are then parroted ad nauseum even after they are shown to be completely untrue thats the sort of thing i was referring to basically the whole postfactualmindset is just i cant wrap my head around it try going months strictly inside the rightwing echo chamber fox news always on tv rush and hannity with some beck in the car the daily caller on the internet day after day all you hear is negative liberal conservative patriot dont believe the lamestream media bad obama etc etc it will warp your mind beliefs understanding of reality and sadly your ability to think critically gtplenty of people choose to believe the propaganda of the gop and fox news knowing full well that its not trueso its like pro wrestling its more for entertainment the fact that it happened while he was president does not at all mean that he is solely responsible for it the fact that he was alerted by the outgoing admin warned repeatedly in briefings and richard clark was running around all summer with his hair on fire should be considered when you make that judgement meanwhile obama is responsible for the shitty economy right also dont forget clinton was trying his damnedest to get in to kill obl but could not get permission he sent a missile and the republicans accused him of wagging the dog the republicans actively prevented clinton from taking care of the situation to talk about the bj when bush took office clinton pleaded with bush to handle it well we know how that ended not to mention giving up the hunt for bin laden  months after  not just giving up saying that it didnt matterand arguably thats true one man is not a movement and kililng him just makes him a martyr so expending exponentially more effort to get just him rather than getting as many as possible and hoping hes caught in the net is sensibleunfortunately that interpretation doesnt jive with any other republican points at the time  they repeatedly called saddam hussein evil and focused a huge amount of attention on spending the resources to get just him then when obama took office suddenly obl was a big deal again until he was killed  then again it wasnt a big dealexpecting the republicans to maintain a level of consistency either vertically or horizonally just sets you up for disappointment at a certain point its foolish to even consider to possibility as anything other than an occasional happy accidentand even then its only a matter of time before they switch course again gtnot just giving up saying that it didnt matter and arguably thats truewhat ive read is that it has had a significant impact on recruitment and support he was a figurehead and there is no one to replace himbit like beatlemania we all get sucked up when its happening but shoot the beatles in the face and theres no point buying the special pants anymore even if there are other bands anytime anyone calls obama a socialist i simply respond with this  corporate profits are at record highs sure seems like socialism to me eh comrade so you admit that the corporations have obama in their pocket   obviously either side has them pocketed its been that way for years im not saying one side is better or worse because they are both influenced by special interests and financially motivated people or shareholders bush was just as guilty so was clinton theres no difference between the two but claiming one is a socialist when the others do the exact same shit is just pointing fingers and wrongly accusing people of things for personal gain for some reason american politics has shifted from what have we done right to this guy is a monster hes trying to drive the country into the ground when you have convinced yourself the cia had been fooled according to this theory bin laden was merely pretending to be planning an attack to distract the administration from saddam hussein whom the neoconservatives saw as a greater threatin your zest to avenge daddy you might miss a few details   read against all enemies by richard clarke and youll come away feeling differently  clinton was borderline obsessed with bin laden and al qaeda during his administration while the bush administration completely ignored all warnings and threats are you talking about bush or obama and then he took us on a crusade to burn the wrong house they really must think we are goldfish most of us are unfortunately a poll in oct  had upwards of  of americans believing that saddam hussein was behind the  attacks deleted ive heard  was bigger in terms of loss of life than pearl harbor deleted screwed up it ensured the us entry the us was neutral until that point also in terms of security failure deaths are a lot more important than historical impact of which we cant determine s full role yet this is unfair terrorist attacks are a difficult threat to stop  you can only really hope to minimize the danger unless you count the us embassy in tehran  jimmy carter  until today not even close to be fair it would have happened under any other president and in his defence it never happened again god bless the memory of those who gave their lives and god bless america  thank you  closing words of obamas prepared statement on the libya killingsfox amp romney are lying douchebags  not that should surprise anyone that that youre stuttering dude   to my knowledge they werent actually talking about obama so the post you are responding to may be inaccurate  i did read that they spent several days complaining that the democratic party removed any references to god from their official party platform or something like thati dont know but i think that may be what they are talking about  quite frankly i could care less  i wish obama and every other president didnt talk about god in every speech  i mourn the memory of the troops that died and i wish better success for my country in the future  lets keep god in church and out of politics  the idea that if a politician doesnt talk about god enough somehow means they cant lead is one of the largest problems i have with the current direction of this country he never mentions the flying spaghetti monster either in his speeches what is wrong with the guy doesnt he realize he will bring noodly wrath down upon us i am not yet ready for onethousand years of suffering in his boilinglakes of broth may those afflicted with celiac disease be spared his gluteny vengeance ramen the streets will run brown with the remains of the celiac unbelievers funny you should mention that  ive been working on this theory that if there is a god hes causing all this bad stuff to happen to america because of the republicans   years of relative peace under clinton  then bush gets elected the wtc towers are brought down and the economy goes in the tank  then obama gets elected iraq dies down the economy stabilizes though it doesnt improve and afghanistan starts winding down  now on the eve of a major election with republicans gaining support through lies and misdirection and after  years of republicans stymying every effort at improvement this happens  its a warning people  god hates the republicans  dont elect romney or hell punish us some more they got on him about not using god in his speeches wtf he shouldnt be allowed to use god in his speeches  he is the president that is a noreligion jobgtbelieving with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man amp his god that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only amp not opinions i contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole american people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof thus building a wall of separation between church and state thomas jefferson not to mention that he ends all of them with god bless america anyway just like every president ever i dont mean to alarm you but the essay you are citing also mentions god you might want to burn it or something took me a second to get this fsmdamn you god and religion are not the same thinggod is a concept religion is an administrative organizationgod is an idea and regardless of if you acknowledge the idea you are still lead by something in life and this can be one thing a few things or something different every second that is god and if we throw out god with religion we will just end up fucking ourselves up the idea of god is very powerful its has the power to oppress it has the power to liberate we are in a precarious grey area of our civilization the god that oppresses has been declared dead but unless were careful that same god will return with greater force in another form and maybe this time we wont be able to set ourselves free from it being president isnt a noreligion job you might think it ought to be but thats a very different statement rather the government writ large isnt to give preferential treatment to one religion over another or none at all that the only way to accomplish this is for the president to appear nonreligious personally is a failed argument being a noreligion job and appearing nonreligious are two different things he doesnt have to be or appear nonreligious on his own time but religion shouldnt be a part of his platform speeches or decisions  and he should not be criticized for not mentioning god in speeches like it is a requirement for officerepublican complaints that the president doesnt mention god enough that the president might be a muslim in a derogatory way or that the president might be an atheist in a derogatory way all lean toward respecting a specific religion and fall into territory where the wall between church and state resides none of the cable news networks left out politics yesterday msnbc played  footage until noon and then returned to their regular political programming wasnt just fox  he means not politicizing  msnbc went to regularly scheduled news and opinions fox went on a tirade about obama being muslim and not saying god enough no msnbc was on a kick yesterday about new evidence that bush ignored warnings about personally im glad because this shit is like entertainment to me and i was afraid yesterday would be no fun i dont know how reporting the facts is meant to be politicizing   was inherently political those facts dont necessarily carry loaded opinions but if there is evidence that bush ignored warnings about the biggest attack on america in recent history then thats fucking news it wouldnt be an opinion thats obviously biased and it is just the straight up lies similar to obama being a muslim thats reporting on an event that happened i normally agree that fox and msmbc are equally biased but not in this case fox made  into an unfounded weapon against obama msmbc was reporting on a potential scandal that would blow the doors off of watergate  sadly thats kind of the problem fox news has turned politics into a reality show and for most of their viewers its there number  show they just see and take in but they dont think all it is is entertainment but thats actually partially true although misleading as hell thats not regularly scheduled programming on fox i wouldnt know my mother does not watch msnbc because dem dang liberals and i dont watch any cable newsedit not sure why this is being attackeddownvoted my mother watches fox news that is why i know what happens on fox news she doesnt watch msnbc or cnn because she thinks they are liberal i do not watch fox news msnbc or cnn because i dont watch cable news whats the issue let me guess you get outraged when other people act proud of their ignorance i have no idea what you are implying here of course you wouldnt i went back and looked and no why would i be outraged at someone for their ignorance of what is on cable newsfuck off you say manage like its something fox news rarely accomplish or have to work at the attacs on the us embassies should provide the republican with some new fear fuel its very unfortunate but those deaths will be politically played out just like the ones on indeed there you go  dont forget that obama is muslim according to fox what does god need with a mention by the president in every speech putting the humor of this aside its a good question to be asking gt they manage to be cuntsyou make it sound like they have to try i just put on fox news to see what the other side is saying since i generally watch msnbc but get news online from a large variety of sources but holy shit this one woman gets up there and says that obama supports muslim fundamentalists taking over the middle east implying that he is muslim himself although she never actually said it and the way they were talking about egyptians and libyansyou would think it was someone talking about black people during the s i am terrified that people truly turn to this as their main source of news when has fox news not been a huge fucking cunt muslims are bad because their religion is bad  minutes later why doesnt obama talk about religion every time he speaks is he secretly a muslim why does he like terrorists so much deleted fox new is owned by prince alwaleed bin talal alsaud of saudi arabia look it upedit owner is a bad description hes more of a significant shareholder my favorite part is how everyone bashes fox news for being biased and then gets their news from comedy centrals daily show  the point of the daily show and colbert report is that you already know the news thats why its funny you arent going to laugh at a joke you dont understandim sure there are some people who watch that also dont know whats going on but most of the people who watch do know whats going on youd think so and even watching it without watching the news it is still a funny show my only concern is that there are a large portion of well informed political afficiandos who get their news strictly from colbert and the daily show and then jump on a high horse bashing fox for being fake or biased i dont think they get the irony ah well at least comedy central doesnt try to pass themselves off as a serious news network even though some people take it out of context to fair told reporters to publish statement until  seriously and then he flipflopped on that as wellgt the campaign had initially planned to hold the statement until after midnight  and the end of the eleventh anniversary of september th  but lifted the embargo an hour and a half early as the controversy flared over a series of attacks against the us embassy in cairo and the american consulate in benghazi libya yea its like they were so giddy they just couldnt sit on it anymore they just knew they had this big thing and they were going to get obama really makes you wonder about who is advising romney like seriously what semiintelligent political strategist with any experience would think this is a good idea apparently romney himself was the key driver which is no surprise really since its the most tonedeaf course of action possible gtseems legit we must wait one minute out of respect before the bloodfest begins again not a second to lose rampage lana did you get that lanalanalana omg it was amazing  i know right such a blast woo but seriously you have to try the kelp wrap tape  kelp tape mitt hates poor people black people jewish people hispanics muslims he kkk super hero he is bishop of a church that spoke of miscegenation being worthy of deathfor those unaware of thiswho are blindly downvoting  brigham young shall i tell you the law of god in regard to the african race if the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of cain the penalty under the law of god is death on the spot this will always be so did some reading on joseph smith this morning turns out he changed his story about finding the tablets a couple times before he found one that stuck guess its just a church thing  yes he also got caught whoring around by his wife and then had his epiphany about plural marriage   dumdumdum dumdum  whenever a passage in the book of mormon comes under scrutiny for being contentious in a modern context an elite group of mormons get sent in to translate their divine copy as they may have originally circulated a not  verbatim version of it the new translation always comes back with some more appealing modern wording gotta love it you can probably find outlandishly racist quotes by members of just about any religion if you look in the mids  the southern baptist convention is the secondlargest christian denomination in the us behind the catholic church and it was created specifically so that its members could hold slaves without being in violation of church policy  i agree that the lds church isnt the most tolerant church out there today but bringing up quotes from  years ago is pretty disingenuous gtthe southern baptist convention is the secondlargest christian denomination in the us behind the catholic church and it was created specifically so that its members could hold slaves without being in violation of church policyim from the south and well aware of southern baptists too thats hardly an endorsement of mormonism gti agree that the lds church isnt the most tolerant church out there today but bringing up quotes from  years ago is pretty disingenuousit was a quote from one of the most important founders of the religion and they didnt allow black members in until a few decades ago im not a big fan of any religion but this is a recent one that actually has documented evidence that it was founded by conmen and racists my point wasnt that the sbc is great just that many things have changed since  years ago  abraham lincoln himself said some pretty amazing things about how black people were inferior to white people and he was the dude who freed the slaves  mormonism had the unfortunate timing of being invented during this period so it makes sense that its leaders had some pretty bigoted views  im not a big fan of any religion either and im particularly not a fan of the mormon church after the whole california proposition  mess but there are lots of ways to point out the mormon churchs intolerance that are more honest than dredging up racist quotes from a time when just about everybody was slinging racist quotes gtabraham lincoln himself said some pretty amazing things about how black people were inferior to white people and he was the dude who freed the slaves and as much as i respect him i wouldnt mistake him for being the hand of some omnipotent beinggtthere are lots of ways to point out the mormon churchs intolerance that are more honest than dredging up racist quotes from a time when just about everybody was slinging racist quotesbut it is a quote from someone they considered divinely inspired and joseph smith was even worse and i agree that there are more recent examples like prop  or the open bigotry well into the s keep in mind that mormons do believe their prophets wereare influenced by god but their belief in that system is more nuanced they believe that the prophet is still very much susceptible to human fallacy and could possibly even misinterpret gods intentions they dont believe that god literally speaks to them in english they believe that god provides indirect guidance to prophets through emotional response to prayer and other such thingsthis is how they explain away mistakes and outright errors in judgement that previous prophets have made such as the insistence that we would never be on the moon they even use it to justify why their supposedly perfect godgiven marriage ritual was changed  times over the course of the churchs existenceto boil it down  prophet doessays something good that helps the church and its image god is great and perfect the prophet has spoken the perfect word of god prophet doessays something badstupiddownright retarded that harms the church and its image prophet misinterpreted god or fell victim to his own hubris god had nothing to do with itthis is how they have always retroacively justified changes in church policy over the years or they will even claim that what a prophet says does not always constitute official church positionspolicy yep when it suits them the great seer and revelator of the church isnt actually the great seer and revelator gtyep when it suits them the great seer and revelator of the church isnt actually the great seer and revelatorwowwhats the point the book of mormon is quotes from  years ago the quote above from brigham young is from the mormon popethe president of the church is considered a prophet who speaks directly with god they do not make false statements according to church doctrinethis would be akin to a christian calling jesus moses or king david a liar when it comes to what god told them because it doesnt make sense todayand southern baptists are not any better just because they are protestant two wrongs dont make a right they were still wrong for protecting slavery southern baptists however did not state that god told them to kill white people who mix with the spawn of cain gt this would be akin to a christian calling jesus moses or king david a liari think it would be more akin to a catholic noting that the views of a past pope were incorrect which happens all the time  the pope is supposed to be infallible and speak for god on earthgt and southern baptists are not any better just because they are protestant two wrongs dont make a rightif you read my post again i wasnt trying to excuse that behavior as right  i was only pointing out that if you want to draw conclusions about a particular religious faction today its not particularly relevant to note that they were racist  years ago because just about everybody was back then mormons changed the rules about blacks being able to become priests in   this is not about statements in the s this is about statements that were still in place after the civil rights movementin  they were making statements like this one the reason that one would lose his blessings by marrying a negro is due to the restriction placed upon them no person having the least particle of negro blood can hold the priesthood brigham young it does not matter if they are onesixth negro or onehundred and sixth the curse of no priesthood is the same if an individual who is entitled to the priesthood marries a negro the lord has decreed that only spirits who are not eligible for the priesthood will come to that marriage as children to intermarry with a negro is to forfeit a nation of priesthood holders i certainly dont think those statements are excusable but  was a long time ago too  i mean robert byrd was a member of the fucking kkk in the s and s and he was a us senator until two years agoi think the mormon church is one of the more intolerant ones out there i just think there are better examples than centuryandahalf old quotes  the rule about black priests you mentioned is one of them  the lds churchs response to prop  is an even more current one its the reddit way gt members gt brigham youngyeah just some random member members leaders whatever  i bet you can find some horrific things said by past leaders of any religion  my point is that those quotes arent a very relevant reason to bash the current lds church  dont get me wrong im no fan of the mormons  all im saying is that there are plenty of current examples of their intolerance that are far more relevant eg prop  i would agree but they read the old testament like it should be applied today and the is a lot older than  years then thats what should be brought up when discussing the intolerance of the lds church  not some racist quote from a guy whos been dead since  so pretty much everyone in the us will die on the spot giving that not a single white man is  pure if you trace the history nobody said you had to be smart to start a religion regarding his wivesi dont care how you bring em as long as you bring em young  brigham young wow  just so everyone knows this is currently not the position of the lds church at all a more current stance on racism is reflected in this quote by the previous lds prophet gordon b hinkley gti remind you that no man who makes disparaging remarks concerning those of another race can consider himself a true disciple of christ nor can he consider himself to be in harmony with the teachings of the church of christlet us all recognize that each of us is a son or daughter of our father in heaven who loves all of his children do you know when he made that statementhardly a saving grace source pulled from a  article that byu students still felt uncomfortable in their own skin on campus so that doesnt mean the principle of what hinkley said somehow is negated because of that really so it doesnt bother you that just six years ago a prophet had to tell mormons to not be jerks to people that were a different color than them  it wasnt like  was the first time any mormon said anything against racism the circlejerk in this thread is ridiculousjoseph smith  i have just been perusing your correspondence with doctor dyer on the subject of american slavery and the students of the quincy mission institute and it makes my blood boil within me to reflect upon the injustice cruelty and oppression of the rulers of the people joseph smith runs for presidentcampaigns on an antislavery platform we holds these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equalbut at the same time some two or three millions of people are held as slaves for life because the spirit in them is covered with a darker skin than ours joseph proposes the sale of public lands to pay for the release of every slave and to abolish slavery by  deseretutah constitution amended to extend rights to allin accordance with the provisions of the act passed at the last session of the general assembly and approved january   which so amended the constitution of the state of deseret gave suffrage to persons of color the proposed amendment was submitted to the people at the general election held on the first monday in february last  and were ratified by an almost unanimous vote deseret news want to learn more  all i said was two years after that quote was said just because byu students still felt uncomfortable in their own skin on campus doesnt negate the principle of why hinkley said what he did what are you exactly assuming here out of context it looks like your point has leverage but i literally cant follow the flow of conversation all the way to what you said right here it isnt making any sense to medude said position of lutherans used to be racist because of a root philosophy from the religion then someone else said that this isnt fair to say because they have changed their minds they cant do that who says and quoted hinkley saying a more morally righteous stance of race in accordance with how the religion has evolvedand then you come and say that two years later people still feel uncomfortable about being the race they are ok doesnt this mean they feel this way because of people who arent taking what hinkley said seriously if this isnt representative everywhere then whats the point in saying his quote isnt a saving grace its not supposed to even be a saving grace in the first place and no one said it was it was meant to reflect the modern stance on race from the lds churchi feel like from point to point i can understand why you said that but looking at the thread as a whole i dont see how what you said is explicitly relevant and pertains exactly to what the argument was sogt reallyyesgtso it doesnt bother you that just six years ago a prophet had to tell mormons to not be jerks to people that were a different color than themno this does bother me but it didnt have to do with the motive behind what i saidedit removed introductory condescension im a dick sometimes when i dont need to be romney was a mormon before  anyways so he spent most of his life in an openly racist religion and now a semicloseted racist religion actions speak louder than words so did hinckley consider brigham young and many other church leaders up until the late s not to be a true disciple of christ that seems like a strange comment for him to make considering the churchs history christ changes his mind all the time  seriously  never try place a delivery order for chinese food with this guy one of the things aboud the lds church is that their belief in direct conversation with god means that the rules change all the time generally in time with changes in the us so it was right when young said it but its a wrong now its more accurate to say that they believe the prophet of the church does not actually have direct conversation with god and is quite often subject to his own hubris and intellectual flaws this is how they justify many historical positions and words of previous prophets such as well never go to the moon  or more years from now the church will be saying that god always intended that gays were not to be discriminated against in any manner and that the bible was mistranslated or its authors were flawedwrong on that and previous prophets misinterpreted god or never got an answer from god so they had to do their best with what they had you read that right mormons believe that even the prophet sometimes cant get an answer from the lordother than that they do actually believe that god changes his mind a lot or rather alters the course of church beliefs based on his grand plan for the earth and everyone on it wow they allow in black members in the s and denounce killing people for miscegenation in  quite the progressive institution never mind the fact that the religion itself was founded by rabid racists and womanizersand were not talking about some crazy middleeastern pastoralists from  years ago womanizers makes them sound cooltry statutory rapists to be fair marrying young was quite common when most people only made it into their s if lucky i suppose so as was marrying first cousinsboth things are still common and legal in rd world counties actually i think marrying cousins is now legal in may states as the  headed baby myth has been debunked yeah the lds church is really good at having religious revelations like that arent they at curiously convenient times too i guess this brigham young guy must not have been a really important part of the church though right i mean otherwise theres no way hed have said something was the law of god forever unchanging only for it to change later so completelyrightprobably just some guy making silly things up at the timeright religion and logic do not go together well they actually refer to him as brigham old news now on an official basis just so everyone knows they believe in their sacred text they cannot pick and choosepublic statements used to quell non believers tell us nothing about what the church believes lying for the lord the official position held by the lds church is nothing but politicking and realizing that being so blatantly racist is not accepted by most of the country any morehowever in actuality many lds churches are just as racist  my wife had a friend that was excommunicated by her church and disowned by her family for marrying a latino  sure no more racism in the lds church im sorry but youve been misinformed no one is excommunicated from the lds church for marrying people of other races and anyone being disowned by her family for doing it would be so incredibly against church teachings i wouldnt know where to start if i met someone who did that im a caucasian mormon but i have  half black cousins  other cousins married to black men an uncle married to a chinese woman resulting in  half chinese cousins and a sister married to a mexican resulting in  half mexican nieces and nephews all active mormons by the way i love all of them like crazy ive been misinformed  my wife is a friend of this person and knows about it firsthand  just because your lds church doesnt care doesnt mean others dont yes youve been misinformed if your wifes friend was excommunicated it was for other reasons than marrying a latino i am  certain i see  i guess you know what church she was a part of and were a member there  wow just wow  typical lds apologistdefender you are well that makes everything alright   was brigham young not speaking directly to god when he made the above statements yeah all of the white an delightsome children of god need to be nice to those who suffer under the curse of skin of blackness so per your post brigham young  one of the founders of the faith  was teaching things that were contrary to being a true disciple of christ and this was church policy until very recentlyhuh  thats not internally inconsistent or anything back to zero you go thanks i dont mind the downvotes i just hate when people downvote for facts they dont like gti just hate when people downvote for facts they dont likethis is how reddit has operated for quite some time now why do you think each sub has such isolated and narrow narrative on the topics they claim to represent dissenting opinions are quelled in most subs with downvotes i can think of a few places where there might be exceptions i dunno it seems like usually people are good about dissent as long as they arent just making baseless attacks  real men and women read all dont forget women gay and lesbians  well after  that is  he seemed to like us before that he never liked us only our money  and your vote  running for governor of ma supporting gays gets more votes  running for president as a republican hating gays gets more votes  romney likes votes and power and whatever leads to thoseedit i forgot to add money he also likes money and whatever leads to more of it  i guess i dont hold that against him as much since i too like money dingwe have a winnersadly the only prize i have left is an upvote so there you go  seemed to being the operative words mitt doesnt have to time learn about all these other kinds of people out there hes focusing on his favorite rich white men  with great whiteness comes great responsibility  i read that in elmer fudds voice with gweat whiteness comes gweat responsibility  but you know elmers probably chilling with those guys hanging some dude and drinking a beer eatin rabbit stew i think thats more accurate  he doesnt necessarily hate ppl his focus is just on a certain kind of them not so sure about that we know he wears mom jeans manufactured from fresh mothers skin good point this is fox news level commenting right heredo you really not see the similarities between obama is a socialist muslimsympathizer and romney hates the poor black jewish hispanic and muslim exactly this  i dont much like romney but these types of comments are really unnecessary  the fact that this comment is currently at  points is sickening to me    welcome to reddits political majority where if you said the same thing but about obama the upvotes and downvotes magically reverseedit or rather maybe just reddits political voting majority if youre so butthurt go hang out on stormfront nancy one has no factual basis in realitythe other has at least some basis based upon mitts current platformboth involve the word basis do you actually think romneys platform consists of hating minorities and the poor because that would not be good pr he may not support them as much as obama but then obama is far more socialist compared to romney its relative maybe hating isnt the word but maybe lack of empathy caring or any basic humanity towards the poor and minorities would be better descriptionhis platform consists partly of denying homosexuals the right to marry minority a taxation platform which decreases the taxes of the wealthy and increases the taxes paid by the middle and lower classes poor a desire to initiate aggressive actions  including war  on countries like iran and antiislamic speeches minorities islamics and his support of corporate personhood poor middle class people in generalas for obamas being far more socialist in the grand scheme of things obama is more or less a moderatemoderateleft conservative compared to global political leanings gt maybe hating isnt the word im not here to argue the political platform of the candidates i was challenging the sensationalism styling of a candidates actions which we both seem to agree was egregious i was challenging the sensationalism styling of a candidates actionsi wouldnt quite say its sensationalist while youre not here to argue his political platform the fact is that the majority of what people think about him is derived directly from his platform he wasnt exactly a big name in politics prior to the presidential electiongiven his platform it isnt such a far stretch as to believe he has it out for lower class americans and minorities middlemiddle to poor everything he seems to represent the purchasing of elections via unlimited donations anonymously to superpacs dismantlement of an affordable healthcare solution denial of gay marriage could very much seem very hateful to the people who these positions affect gt given his platform it isnt such a far stretch ok given that obama introduced legislation to introduce a universal healthcare system in the us it isnt such a stretch to assume that he supports similar social programs at the federal level qed obamas a socialist given that the obama administration decided to apologize to rioters outside the embassy for an american expressing their right to free speech instead of defending it we can assume that obama can empathize with them they represent islam on an extreme level it isnt such a stretch to say that he understands and recognizes their positionqed obama sympathizes with extremist muslimsnow before im downvoted to oblivion for my crazy opinions these are not actually my beliefshowever one candidate should be given the same benefits as their counterparts if were going to slightly stretch the truth for one then why not stretch the truth for the other its bothersome to see especially on a site that promotes freethinkinggt he wasnt exactly a big name in politics prior to the presidential electionhe was in new england romneycare was a pretty big deal coming from a republican who was voted as governor of a historically blue state the difference is that this is a discussion board while fox is a television network id like my hyperbolic vitriol confined to the internet if you please  but leading a discussion with a flawed comment sets the foundation for a flawed discussionits interesting to see everyone rushing to justify how this is different from fox makes one wonder eh fox has an originized political stance set by its management and pushed by every single host on every show reddit has a couple thousand people all with their own political opinions some of them sensible some of them outright crazyhow are the two comparable in any way shape or form gt fox has an originized political stance set by its management and pushed by every single host on every showreddit is very liberal there can be no debate on that that agenda is pushed through the karma system unpopular opinions are buried and popular opinions are given the most attention thats precisely how fox works thats how theyre comparable  i think youre taking the comment too seriously i think rpolitics takes fox too seriously the ellipses are my passiveaggressive way of undermining your point i dont actually have anything more to say hahahaha youre right rpolitics definetely does people need an outlet to vent though so all good i supposemakes a person think more and more about specific things gt people need an outlet to vent though so all good i supposethats fair i just dont like seeing people use fox as a means to justify their disposition towards conservatives oh i dont mean fox news propaganda is propagandai mean discussion  how do you figure he hates jews  this doesnt show hatred for jews no simply enough contempt for other cultures and beliefs that they would disregard any ounce of respect for their dead to make themselves look good you dont understand mormonism obviously does anyone they lost me in the magic underwear i understand it as much as any nonpracticing person who has the ability to comprehend things past an eighthgrade reading level can granted i havent been to or seen any of the temple rites or what goes on behind closed doors mostly things from sources who used to be involved in the church usually biased against it but its not hard to gather what the intent of baptizing the dead is hey we got this sweet deal in the afterlife for all eternity and we want to make sure everyone else is on it thats fine and dandy but assuming mormonism completely true for a moment id rather not spend an eternity hanging out with one group of people they would take that away from me if given the chance or if even mattered at all gtthats fine and dandy but assuming mormonism completely true for a moment id rather not spend an eternity hanging out with one group of people they would take that away from me if given the chance or if even mattered at alloh yea i agree  one of the many many reasons i left the religion i was raised in was because of essentially this even if they were right i would rather be dead lolbut my point still stands they dont do it out of hatred of jewish people they may be misguided in the practice but its not malicious how is it contempt it doesnt hurt anybody and they believe that someone can be saved after theyre dead in the off chance that mormons have it right i dont give a shit if they try to baptise me after im deadif they were contemptful they would argue that jews and others arent worthy of salvation this is the opposite where they believe everyone deserves it despite what they did in the pastim all for dissing mormons but i have to draw the line at they hate jews gtin the off chance that mormons have it right i dont give a shit if they try to baptise me after im deadon the slightly larger offchance that theyre wrong you might get into trouble for being mormonized  not really because you didnt consent to it  it is contempt because the mormons who engage in this practice dont think the valuesbeliefsmagic powers that are different or come from somewhere different are good enough to warrant leaving the people who follow it alone for eternity its like oneupping in a conversation but at a cosmic level doesnt everybody hate them at least when the muslims arent doing something heinous he worked on wall street zing because mitts comments will get jews killed as a potential president of the us yeah they could which comments no he likes jews or more specifically wants all the jews to move to israel so his god can return from the celestial realm and bring about the apocalypse is he honestly trying to win this seems like he is doing all the wrong things to win the election he is completely absurd not a fan of obama but he isnt as stupid as this moron  and reddit hates rich people jews muslims and women if you want to generalize like that im not sure sure about that i heard he went down on bibi while visiting the me hates jewish people are you kidding his biggest supporters are jewsedit his biggest financial supporters and thats pure fact i cant tell if this is a tongueincheek humorous post but ill take it as a serious responsehis biggest supporters are most definitely not jews  in fact most of the jewish population doesnt even plan on voting for him  many of the most orthodox jews agree with his and other republican stances but those jews make up  of american jews and as i said not all of them agree with republicans let alone with romneythis leaves the remaining  of jews that almost exclusively lean democrat  theyve been this way for decades  many of the democratic ideals are in line with jewish practices and ways of lifenow you may say that ive twisted this around to sound like you said most jews are romney supporters  however jews make up  of the american population  this is around  million people   of this is a little less than  people  im gonna go ahead and say that even if all of these jews are of legal age to vote and they all support romney these  are not enough close to the largest demographic of romney supporterssource im jewish attend synagogue regularly visit another more religious synagogue at least once every other month while visiting family and regularly receive jewish newsletters and other media via mail while i agree with you and am totally on your side sources would give your comment an extra punch i said his biggest supporters where did i say the majority of jews support him thats not the same thing i just clarified that i meant financial but still where do you get majority out of biggestbiggest  the ones that support him the most how do you support a candidate the most with money of course i never implied in the least that most jews support romney but thanks for the long story that doesnt apply to me anyways ah thanks for the clarification  sorry i assumed you meant largest in number not in money your saying that jews support romney more than southern white republicanspass that doobie did you read a fucking word i said couragewhat you say is true im not clear on the down votes he gets a lot of money from the proisrael folks many of them are jewish yes and it is false anything else troll boy learn to be more concise and youll pop less blood vessels exploring the interwebs you claimed that jews are romneys largest financial supporters which is also incorrect goldman sachs jpmorgan morgan stanleylets put it this way i guess since we all know reddit is fond of this approach you claim that jews are his biggest financial backers all im asking for is a source yeah goldman not jewish at all have you tried horseradish its delicious what more interesting is the libertarian ryanaynrand thing  i mean i understand the woman favored israel but she also believed in isolationism which would have the us cut ties with israel  why isnt ryan called to the carpet for this and therefore romeny ryan is nothing close to a real libertarian especially not since he joined the romney ticket no true scotsman i am noticing that in the case of libertarians it really seems like each and every one of them can claim no true scotsman on all the others whenever its convenient which it usually is or is it just the libertarians on reddit ryan is nothing close to a real libertarian  which republican is paul was the closest thing the gop had but he strayed from libertarianism on issues like abortion predictably the libertarians tend to be in the libertarian party romeny supports israel  that is different from supporting jews  many conservative christians support israel because they believe that will help bring about the end of the world and the rapture so jesus can come and take them to heavan for supporting the holy land  they dont care one bit about the jews that live there some of his biggest supporters are jews yes shelly adelson after dumping  million on anti romney ads in the primaries is backing him with obscene amounts of money and yes is jewishguess what obamas biggest personal contributor is jeffrey katzenberg im going out on a limb here to say hes not irish just because this thread went full retard doesnt mean we need to perpetuate it with more inflammatory bull crapmost jews dont support romney a very wealthy jew with an extremist zionist world view is giving romney nearly  million this particular guy mr adelson is a  issue guy if you follow his money over the years  his loyalty is to israel and he demands the same from those he bankrollsmost jews myself and most of my family included find both shelly adelson and mitt romney disgusting those that dont are almost always very hateful toward muslims at least behind closed doors romneys biggest financial supporters can be found here  while there are jews on that list there many more christians and even more mormons nice try evildoer his comments will get jews killed  that is not exactly how you support someone ohh hey  look  another bullshit post that tries to represent itself as intellectual and enlightened but is no better than that deep southern ignorant rednecks good job asshole  you look like an idiot deleted this  the romney campaign criticized a calming press release that was issued before the embassy attack claiming that the press release was in response to the attack  i honestly think they just fucked up but in pure gop style they cant admit the fuck up so are doubling down on obama apologizing for the attack and avoiding responsibility for the apology  the fucking statement was issued before the attack  this is deep nonsense and the statement was not issued by obama thistoo romney is criticizing the statement that came from the administrationand the embassy is the administrationhes fucking chastising the statement of the embassy that just got attacked in order to attack obama amazing while true couldnt one consider his appointed ambassadors part of his administration  i believe the statement said obama adminstration not obama  granted its ridiculous either way but if we want to look at semantics     yes  mitts ambassadors would be standing on the front steps shouting to the crowd free speech so fuck you all i can understand romneys confusion hes used to retroactively retiring retroactively changing whether or not he was the head of a company when it was doing things that seem bad and not able to remember whether he cut peoples hair but he knows he didntmaybe he just has no sense of the flow of time like dr manhattan all is now to mitt romney with no difference between any of them maybe thats why hes confused about what came before and after republizen afterward the radicals had breached the walls torn down the american flag and replaced it with an islamist banner the embassy sent out a tweet now deleted which said this mornings condemnation issued before protest began still stands as does our condemnation of unjustified breach of the embassy so after the attack the embassy reaffirmed the preemptive appeasement that is what romney criticized preemptiveappeasmentasshattery deep nonsense is just your modern american political discourse brought to you by republicorp romney claims that he was referencing the second statement by the embassy which occurred a few hours after the attack started  that statement condemned the attack and reaffirmed the original statement that the embassy issued before the attacks which is what opened the window up for romney to use this for political gain someone tell me what the fuck gop is i dont fucking know  grandoldpartyrepublicans grand old party   gop  grand old partyits just a nickname that has been used by the republican party for decades unsure of the specific origin but as it relates to the modern party it is a wholly undeserved moniker thanksguysmpeg i feel like the gop this time around is basing their campaign on nothing but inflammatory statements they enjoy getting people riled up on my drive to work i saw a sticker on a truck that said fuck rebuilding change it back to reagan i realize that a lot of people hate the term low information voters but particularly when you are dealing foreign policy issues many americans truly are low information  everything about this campaign and the current rnc screams to me that they are playing hard to low information voters and doing so with the utmost cynicismtldr  the republicans dont give a fuck about facts and know that their core voters are ignorant and easily manipulated theyre angry about gw bush and his presidency full of stupid jokes also i want somebody to go on the news and have a debate with this asshat and just keep on saying reince just stop it stop lying stop it and not let him talk until he stops lying  if obama really is that bad then why must they lie about everything hes done  unfortunately the voters to whom this rhetoric is directed will never bother to fact check it the romney campaign desperate cringe just wait until the debates and the weeks prior to the election if they are feeling this desperate now its only going to get worse i expect some sort of crazy gambit to make a debut during the debates i read something funny yesterday it was the onion type piece that ann romney insisted she be at mitts side during the debates seriously though now that all this foreign policy is getting interjected into this race mitt will be flailing because the only thing he polls well on is the economy this will be very interesting to say the least mitt romney rendering the onion redundant since  george w bush made that happen in  his administration are the ogs of political satire no henry kissinger winning the nobel peace prize is the og of ruining political satire well yes thats true but even he didnt make a jackass of himself every time theres a camera pointed on him giving the peace prize to obama when he had barely taken office and to that point had quite frankly done nothing but become the first black president was pretty bad too if were talking about undeserved nobel peace prizes nobel peace prize funded by arms manufacturers fortune they werent as good as mittens though i bet theyre pissed they probably cant come up with snarky news stories that are more ridiculous yet still plausible than whats actually happening  they should just write actual news stories about romney it will be just as funny why does he poll well on the economy there will always be people willingdesperate to buy into the ponzi scheme  romney made other people money maybe he will make me money  it isnt possible if government was a business we would call it business instead of government  gtbecause the only thing he polls well on is the economysadly this also happens to be far and away the number one issue voters care about according to polls so that isnt such a bad thing for mittens yet he continually blunders and shows his ineptitude on other issues people need to recognize that his business experience is completely useless for running a nation    in literal terms his experience is in borrowing money to buy companies and then putting that debt on the company and ifwhen it fails to pay back that debt selling off its assets at a profit to himself and closing the businessthe reality is that you cannot sell off the assets of a state and close it because its not making money    the second part of that reality is that its the republican states that receive more federal funds then they put in and the democratic states that support them  that was from andy borowitzs the borowitz report which is a satire column just like the onion it wasnt real andy borowitz new yorker article satire is there any actual proof that the debates will happen or will mitt find a way to get out of them somehow  because i desperately want to watch those debates but it wouldnt surprise me to find out we get screwed ohh they will happen  it will go something like thishost  do you support the pre exiting conditions part of obamacare or notromney  this president has failed to lead millions of people are out of work thanks to himhost  ok  do you still consider russia to be the bigest threat to the us romney  i will never apologize for america to anyone unlike this president   host what books are you reading currentlyoh nm thats a gotcha question for romney no hell ramble off some french book title and his republican base will collectively shit their pants that they were stupid enough to support a liberal elite like romney he speaks fluent french and acts like the stereotypical liberal elite that the republicans hate so much what changed obama isnt as much of a stereotypical liberal elite that romney is someone needs to catch romney speaking in french or at least understanding and responding to someone who asks him a question in french i would love to see what fox news does with that newt gingrich was playing up the whole french thing in an effort to take down romney in the primaries there was file fotage of him speaking french in those ads the amateur by edward klein mormon history books is the proper answer book of mormon  romney may be a unlikeable robot who has problems empathizing with humans but unlike bush he actually seems like a pretty smart guy  i wouldnt be surprised if he has a decent reading list deleted source ill bet you  the debates happen i see what you did there has there ever been a case in modern history of a candidate withdrawing completely from debates this seems like it would be suicide for the romney campaign i dont think you have anything to worry about there the campaigns have already agreed to  debates plus one vp im so pumped for the debates of course obama isnt perfect but i cant wait to see him tear romney a new asshole same for the bidenryan debategood luck lying about obama when hes right fucking next to you and ready to pounce oh god i kind of want to see the debates as im imagining them now  the novelty of seeing two people from two entirely different realities arguing is too much to pass up im excited you misspelled giggle i did didnt i as satisfying as it is to watch them implode it sickens me to think that almost  of our voting electorate supports these imbeciles sounds like you need to see how far you can stick your big toe up some asses that is the part that makes me cringe he was a bad a candidate from the start the fact that hes doing as well as hes doing is astonishing because he lacks substance class or intelligence american people were just killed by a group consisting of only muslims because someone in the us made a video pointing out the flaws of the muslim religion and what does obama do he apologizes why would we want a president who apologizes when innocent american blood was spilled  read his statementill even post it for you if you find the words i am sorry or i apologize ill give you  mitti strongly condemn the outrageous attack on our diplomatic facility in benghazi which took the lives of four americans including ambassador chris stevens right now the american people have the families of those we lost in our thoughts and prayers they exemplified americas commitment to freedom justice and partnership with nations and people around the globe and stand in stark contrast to those who callously took their livesi have directed my administration to provide all necessary resources to support the security of our personnel in libya and to increase security at our diplomatic posts around the globe while the united states rejects efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others we must all unequivocally oppose the kind of senseless violence that took the lives of these public servantson a personal note chris was a courageous and exemplary representative of the united states throughout the libyan revolution he selflessly served our country and the libyan people at our mission in benghazi as ambassador in tripoli he has supported libyas transition to democracy his legacy will endure wherever human beings reach for liberty and justice i am profoundly grateful for his service to my administration and deeply saddened by this lossthe brave americans we lost represent the extraordinary service and sacrifices that our civilians make every day around the globe as we stand united with their families let us now redouble our own efforts to carry their work forward mitt romney human garbage americans serving abroad civilians armed forces were under attack night some them died mitt romney thought was good idea to insult the people who were under attack criticize the president mitt romney worthy to call americanedit picture mitt romney smiling insults members the foreign service criticizes president obama ongoing attack  keep in mind this is the same party that openly mocked a veteranwho dared to run against one of theirs  edit ps heres a better shot of romney smirking about his good luck that some americans were killed contrast his face to those of the reporters in the room who presumably have actual human souls that photo you edited in is a great commentary on romneys lack of humanityempathy  i would really have expected that image to come in the form of a political cartoon rather than a photograph gthave actual human souls no matter how many romney press statements they go tothats how that should have ended this photo is literally the first time ive ever seen romney smile with his eyes journalists with souls wow america really is a strange place  gtmitt romney is not worthy to call himself an americana humanftfy the contrast between those photos you linked is quite clear romney doesnt care that  us dignitaries were killed he thinks he scored a point to be fair i think thats the only expression he has just remember the people who will vote for him tend to be people who call the current president hussein think people like charles krauthammer are the most honest people in america that obama gets to do more or less whatever he wants that everything bad that has happened in the past  years has actually happened in the last  years and is all obamas faultand so on this the closest ive head presidential candidate to saying the good muslim dead muslim just you wait im waiting for the debates where romney will call obama off camera a nigger without realizing his mic is still on yeah becausemuslims americans cant vote in the usawellwho knows with all the republican instigated voter suppression going on well at least in romneys case if he were to win the presidency shudder he would have to graduate to magic depends the only good bug is a dead bug i finally to the point to where i understand political team sleep night is there shame really the same way he slept at night working at bain ends justify the means if he turned a profit it doesnt matter how he got it as long as it doesnt go to jail im sure the business mistakes hes made have haunted him though gt the same way he slept at night working at bain on a pile of money surrounded by many beautiful women profit bad success bad being poor good free stuff from governmentgood must be poor must hate rich and successful the rich and successful have ruined my life it it werent for them i would be rich and successful and know where to place commas wait would i then be bad quite a conundrum when you think of the world in only two dimensions richpoor then you end up sounding pretty stupid  adults can recognize that its possible to make money while upholding high ethical standards but that its also possible to make money legally while screwing over many other people  adults also have the ability to analyze situations from a standpoint other than pure randian selfinterest  maybe someday when you grow up you will understand this in a pile of money surrounded by beautiful women ice to see youmendozaaaaaaaaa sounds suspiciously like the islamic afterlife have you seen his wife shudder he is a bad person romneys foreign policy team is full of blisters from the w bush administrations neocon clown car  so no after that administrations truly tragic failures their choice to stay in politics and advise other people with their obviously flawed ideas shows that they really dont have any shame him and likely his team have a different philosophy then you do so why would he have the same reactions to his behavior as you would have if you behaved similarly he chosen this moment attack america to presidential instead chose to mitt romney this sums it up right here folks  this was not any way for a president or even presidential hopeful to act  this is not somebody we want involved in foreign policy just wait a few minutes and hell tell you something completely different mitt romney attacking obama making this political issue single bit respect the families the victims and by playing the situation so stupidly and dishonestly showed quite a bit of disrespect for all americans not only is he disrespectful as hell romney is a lying sack of shit i dont understand how he gets away with so much of it i guess he figures if he just constantly makes false accusations and baseless assertions and if he repeats the bullshit often enough people will believe him i mean whod have the unmitigated gall to tell baldfaced lies about the president on national tv gotta be some truth to it right fucking douche

muslimareyoufuckingkiddingmejpg which is part of why the race was even close  people are so ignorant that they will believe obama is a muslim despite all evidence against it and will believe everything mitt romney says no matter how many times he changes his stance in a day  our culture has made being uneducated and uninformed a point of pride and that is just plain sad these people also believe that being a muslim is a bad thing which is even sadder  people use that term as an insultmakes me feel all the sads my sads cannot withstand this tears why cant i hold all these tears it far from sad  i wish more christians realize how close islam is to christianity well they both use the ot and worship the same god one i like to call gay short for godallahyahweh hah awesome new acronym to add to my vernacular  how did i never think of this i would give you more upvotes if i could less sad imo there are no facts to suggest that obama is a muslim aside from his name obviously a specious argument but im pretty sure thats why most people think hes muslim however there are facts to suggest that islam and its followers are to be feared  of muslim americans believe suicide bombings are justified sourcethese are people in a country where muslim extremism is almost non existent in comparison to its prevalence in other countries yet a very significant portion of them think blowing yourself up to ensure the deaths of innocent people is a reasonable thing to do  of muslims under  thought suicide bombings are justified so this is not a mentality that appears to be waning in france  of muslims feel suicide bombings are justified over a third of all muslims in france think suicide bombings are justified im sorry for going all caps lock kooky on you but the magnitude of that statistic cannot be understatedthere is also the issue of apostasy in many islamic countries the renunciation of islam or the declaration of atheistic view points carries a death penalty you disagree with islam fine then the punishment is death i personally think that is a very bad thing and were not talking about extremist groups here we are talking about the laws of sovereign nationsi am not a islamaphobe i wont discriminate against someone because they practice islam but i do become somewhat wary of them because these radical view points are far more pervasive in islam than people are willing to admit i am not going to refute any of your statistics on what muslims believe it justified or not in terms of religion nor will i bring up the heinous acts committed by christians or any religion done in the name of said religion and the amounts of people who believe they are justified what i will contend however is that these statistics are hardly applicable to someone who wont even openly admit that he is in fact a muslim someone who cant even come out in the open about his supposed religious affiliation will hardly be organizing suicide bombings in the name of islam nor will be justify those who do you can bring up these statistics to contend that muslims are more likely to be violent or that they are bad people but that does not actually prove causation islam gt violence rather it could be correlation read could it could be that these people are brought up in extremist cultures that also happen to be muslim and will use whatever religious justification to enact hatred and violence again could i am not supporting any acts of violence particular religion or cultural practices just playing devils advocate again even if obama were a muslim i dont believe these statistics would have nothing to do with him gtnor will i bring up the heinous acts committed by christians or any religion done in the name of said religion and the amounts of people who believe they are justifiednor should you we arent talking about other religions so it would be entirely irrelevantgtyou can bring up these statistics to contend that muslims are more likely to be violent or that they are bad people but that does not actually prove causationso what if a study found that  of all drug dealers committed violent felonies would you just scoff at the statistic and say correlation isnt causation it would be very difficult to prove that the drug dealing itself is what caused the violence well maybe not in this particular analogy but i think you can see where im going with this but you can be damn well sure that violence is prevalent among drug dealers it would be an inescapable fact just like extremism is prevalent among muslimsyouve missed my entire point yourdadsbff said heshe believe that its sadder that people believe obama is a muslim than that people believe being muslim is bad as i pointed out there is no reason to believe obama is muslim but there is however reason to believe muslims are prone to violent acts in the name of their religion the point i was trying to convey in one statement would be this its sadder to believe something without evidence for it obama being a muslim than it is to believe something that has evidence for it muslims are prone to violence yes it would be relevant to point out statistics regrading other religions because if just as many other even more christians believed violence is an appropriate way to spread their beliefs then the stats regarding muslims wouldnt prove they are any more prone to violence than someone of another religionif extremism is prevalent among muslims that is one thing i am not denying that but to say obama is a muslim muslims are found to be more extreme than other religions therefore obama condones violence in the name is his religion that is the point i am trying to make which goes along with what i originally was trying to say and that is its sad that people not only want to assign a religion to the president which he does not subscribe to but it is just as sad that its considered ok to assign negative connotations to him because of this supposed religious affiliation i am not refuting your stats but i disagree that its less dangerous to assume something negative because of a religious affiliation as it is to assign that religious affiliation for specious reasons when a group of people you identify with are under threat you justify a lot of things for eg nukeshow many americans are demanding usa apologies to japan its justified thats why shhh pointing out the fact the the so call moderates in islam are fucking nuts is not acceptable well when the media portrays extremist muslims as the enemy for an extended period of time without hardly ever putting any emphasis on the extreme dichotomy this is what you get kinda like how reddit portrays christians as ignorant extremists so redditors think being a christian is bad i wouldnt necessarily limit that to reddit but yeah essentially also though i dont know if you know but the general global view of american christianity isnt all that great either and that is because american christianity is in fact different from global other christianity  something people seldom realize acknowledge can you explain this further american christianity tends to carry itself along similar american principles wealth prosperity abundance etc similar to the american dream because christianity is the predominant religion in american culture you can surely see how throughout american progression religion has shaped american society and american society has shaped its own interpretation of christianity whereas with other nations where christianity isnt an essential part of the nations leadership or isnt practiced in firstworld nations its adoption practice is taken on differently with different interpretations and different significances one classic example of this is how white churches are separated from black churches and while black churches tend to focus on similarities between the passion of jesus his tribulations struggles and how theyre similar with the plight of the black american the white church focuses on giving sharing etc  things without much struggle burden weight these two dynamics are a reflection of both groups experiences in america a negative pessimistic interpretation vs a positive optimistic one both are from the same doctrine yet interpreted from polar opposite viewsadditionally not to mention the chauvinism sense of entitlement and everything else that comes with being an american a christian and with being an american christianmy point is american christianity only caters to the american experience in its many different ways seldom do practicing christians from america actually consider the realities of other nations when preaching their own rhetoric people dont even think about north korea when they think of the book of revelation and how they think it will start in america because biblical prophecies dont count until it starts to happen to them bush and the terrorist attacks obama is the antichrist the illuminati jayz and kanye west giving their hearts to satan only shit that happens in america actually counts in the minds of these people i certainly agree it shouldnt be narrowed down to reddit alonei know christianity in america is different than that of other countries  different countries different cultures different tints on religion  i dont know that it is disliked worldwide i didnt say disliked i just said its reputation isnt all that great because its a selfcentered religious practice in america because americans are naturally selfish generally speaking culturally its just how we are on top of that our christianity is a large limiting factor in our education system nationwide as well except that most redditors understand that not all christians are ignorant extremists oh hey now extremist christians dont need any help being portrayed as ignorant the moderates are not even good and that the presidents religion should matter besides how would a mormon be better religion is all there is to these people they may be ignorant enough to think that a mormon is just another protestant sect how many mormon suicide bombers this week nonehow many muslim suicide bombers this week sadly not noneislam is worse than mormonism both are delusional i didnt realize mormons were being invaded by a foreign army if they were they might react similarly to the japanese obviously suicide attacks are not only linked to religion  well it is though not more so than being a member of any other religion can you name  bigoted ideas that come with islamislam and the religion is general is not a good thingso yes being a muslim is a bad thingas is being a christian it is just currently less bad this is the part that enrages me more than anything i have a lot of friends in the us military and in the us diplomatic corp who are muslims but damn patriotic americans too and every time this kind of stuff gets thrown around like its an insult it diminishes their devotions and hard work  how is being a muslim a good thing how is that specific religious choice good for that individual and the community around himher well if being a christian isnt seen as a detriment to being president of the united states then i dont see why being a muslim should be seen as a detriment you assume that i find that to be a detriment its an admission of a mental delusion delusional people probably shouldnt be in positions of power well then pretty much all of our previous presidentsand our current onehave been delusional and i dont know what else to tell you gti dont know what else to tell youof course you dont because you are avoiding the question how is being a muslim or a christian or any religion for that matter a good thing for that individual and their communitynot all of our presidents have actually been christians however i can understand the retroactive changing of history by the christian right probably provides many more false sources to claim the opposite delusion spreads itself relentlessly calling obama a muslim is the same as calling someone a communist in the s and s its scapegoating its a witchhunt its fearmongering  cant come up with any real reason why not to vote for someone make up something negative about them and blame it on the most likely scapegoat of the day  people who want to believe it will  for their own racistbigotedselfishgreedy reasons  and those that wont are powerless to prove the contrary because theres nothing to disprove  its textbook propaganda in a lot of cases i think muslim is the new code word for nr among the people who believe or convey the belief that obama is a muslim yes i believe you are correct i thought it was a code word for terrorist nutter        nagger naggers best use of this ive ever seen i think i know what it is but i dont know if i should say it youre thinking of socialist unfortunately thats how the progression of thought has changed in the last twenty years absolutely correct any time someone makes an incomprehensible accusation about obama being a muslim just replace it with the nword and suddenly their position is perfectly clearits otherism and scapegoating in classic form there must be something alien and wrong about the guy hes not like us etc you sir deserve an upvote for your insight you just have to study it out forget the s and s theyre calling him a communist now its not that they are ignorant  they are just clinging to these ideas in an attempt to veil what they really think get that nonwhite man out of the white househis name could be alex smith and he could have been born and raised in arkansas and be the most evangelical christian the us had ever seen and these people would still find some reason like hes too christian to justify their racismedit his skin color hasnt changed gtdespite all evidence against itthis with pretty much everything else evolution economic growth etc as well not just the election exactly  i dont know if thats the way its always been but it sure seems like the knownothings are getting louder and more numerous  are we heading for idiocracy no youre just paying more attention to the national political dynamic you will always have crazies this will never cease nations are always fluctuating sometimes you have good times and sometimes you have bad sometimes you take bad moves like bush carter etc other times you take great moves like clinton and obama but experiences are all relative for many obamas reelection was a godsend and greatly needed for others its what the book of revelation predicted regardless i can assure you people living through the economic crisis of the s also probably thought it was the end of days but they got through it and eventually recovered ive heard this argument before and it seems based on the premise that our current way of life is unchanging and that unlike all previous civilizations before it ours will never fail  while there definitely are cycles and life goes on after the end of a dynasty empires do crumble they do there is no denying but you could say the same thing about living its not like you live forever but it does make life that much more enjoyable when you try to live as if you will never dieedit or live like you will doesnt really make a difference its just the idea that you essentially ignore the fact that you will die eventually good analogy and good point  i will try to adopt that philosophy  as soon as i recover from this election hangover seems like it is getting more prevalent with the use of the internet but dont forget about mccarthyism idiocracyits a documentary about the future i was told obama has no respect for women because he is a muslim and he makes women wear scarves on their headthen i pointed out that mrs obama has pretty strong arms therei cant believe how much nonsense they believe ignorance is when you dont know something if you know something and deny it in spite of abundent evidence and frankly logic you are a denialist you no longer live in the real world you live in one constructed by your imagination its a lot easier to hate something if theyre a strawman they have to hate him they just need to justify it to themselves i think most cultures are like this a majority of people are fucking stupid as far as i can tell so much so that you can just about rely on it cynical you are right  i have often suggested there should be some kind of intelligence test to vote  something very simple  but people claim it will disproportionally hurt democrats it will disproportionately hurt the poor  who in this country are often minorities i just dont really understand why a candidates religion has anything to do with the electionas long as he doesnt want to go against whichever one it is amendment that guarantees religious freedom and the separation of church and state i dont see the relevance idiocracy is becoming closer to a reality every day what do you mean closerthey have been around since the simplest mind was made during evolution its a movie so what if he is a muslim so its ok for a christian to lead or a moron to lead but not a muslim that shot dont make sense just like everything romney said during the campaign i think you left out a letter in moron but it still works either way if youre ever in amsterdam please let me hug you xd merica  jeebus the sad thing is that apparently to them being a muslim makes you less suitable for the presidency than being a magicunderpants wearing loony  apparently not as far as half the country is concerned the looney lost to the muslim this is what kills me hell take our guns well never have christmas  um he had  years and made not one single attempt to do any of these things  seriously he actually expanded the right to carry in national parks  but the nra never let silly things like facts get in the way of their agenda the fact that people are still questioning his religion means that he is doing his job correctlywell  with matters of church and state anyway i hope he comes out as muslim tomorrow and then after a long pause says jk atheist  the gene pool will be cleansed by the resulting head explosions im in canada but ive seen some people saying that itll be another illegitimate term since his birth certificate hasnt been officializedi wanted to die i was just thankful that it was a comment on a news outlet and not a friend on facebook ive already deleted the people i dont want to associate with i think the only reason this debate exists is because he may be an atheist its not even a debate its just people who believe nonsense kinda like deistic belief its not really a debate more than it is just people spewing nonsense out of their mouths and those who know better having to put up with it or combating the stupidity with shutup style remarks he is untouchable now might as well use it as an april fools day joke  address the nation that he is indeed a muslim from nigeria  then be like  april fools  and throw up the roc  fade out to biden with some sunglasses on and like  gold chains  cut to commercial  that would be the best i would like to start a fund that reddit could help donate to in order to make this happen kickstarter what they mean is obama is black theres no other reason for them to think believe or even care that hes muslim at all he goes to church and praises his god more than most christians i know he doesnt praise allah he is dark skinned though  as the middle east i find interesting to take to muslim middle eastern theyre the middle east to these people middle eastern people monolithic muslims someone muslim automatically them bad good person automatically them hyperreligious extremist what these people to think i wonder the antiobama rhetoric purely the fact that hes perceived foreigner they call him a muslim and they call him a socialist because even they know they cant call him a nigger in public or you can be like my father and call him all threeedit and not can hahahaha damn youre father sounds cool but you know not he used to be cool until right wing radio and fox news got their claws into him he once told me that he didnt go to church because all the answers he needed were in nature so hed take me for hikes and camping trips instead  i totally feel your pain my father also thinks that the president is a socialist nigger and even a muslim he thinks the same shit that op facebook lady thinks we are all going to lose out rights to everything and anything and that we will all be living in some type of concentration camp come this time next yearits great being around the older generation that has seem to lost it marbles and continues to listen to fox and other right wing nut jobs rollseyes thankfully my wifes aunt a retired public defense lawyer is the exact opposite shes so incredibly disappointed in her generation its enough to keep me sane knowing that there have to be more like her out there  it aint just the elderly i have friends back home who watch fox and listen to everything he said i had this obama is a muslim argument with one of my friendssad thing is he is agnostic gotta channel that blind hatred somewhere right i think their end goal is to justify hating him they feel better about themselves if they have a reason to hate him other than being black the most evangelical christian i had ever personally met was a former boss of mine he was an iranian immigranthe trusted me with a lot of stuff because he knew i was a good christian mani never mentioned religion to him ever cool im iranian too but am atheist christian iranians are usually armenians chaldeans and assyrians btw i couldnt tell you the difference if you hit me upside the head with all three chaldeans and assyrians are a super small minority you probably couldnt tell the different between them and an average iranian armenians have their own culture and language alongside their adherence to christianity as opposed to shia islam all i know is he called himself persian from what ive been told persian  iranian persian is just an ethnic group in iranafghanistantajikistan iran is a multipleethnic country i myself am also persian ethnicity but we have kurds arabs turks etc if he was persian and not armenian or assyrian that means he was probably a convert converts always tend to be more religious than cultural christians born into the religion that sounds about right its just idiots all the way downwe just need to start ignoring them you hit the nail on the head but remember hyper religious is ok if its xtain  i imagine the flip side is also true  i imagine there are radical people in middle eastern countries that would look at me and assume im a christian just because im white and from the us yeah thats actually true as well now that i think about it i very sincerely hold the similar opinion that embracing islam does not make you a hate mongering radical i do notice however that most hate mongering radicals in general do so on the whims of some holy book or another so i still dont really care for it but you are correct as a paleass caucasian who was raised muslim im a little offended people dont accuse me of being secretly muslim america naturally has a way of fostering chauvinism among its isolated people those who have never been outside of the box theyre living in this was something i learned when i moved out of the us and to japan for a small while i can only imagine the type of person id be if i hadnt gotten to experience other cultures and diversity firsthand to get a good look at where i was coming from introspectively a lot of people need that exposure but just dont have it and so chauvinism is the result anything not representative of the nuclear white american family and the things that come with that lifestyle is automatically viewed as wrong unchristian or ungodly and should not be tolerated the funny thing is that he really doesnt look middle eastern at all i bet most of these people are inbred white southerners or midwesterners that have never actually seen a colored person the people who say these things dont really know anything about anything they dont even understand what is going on in america i feel bad this woman it spelled lose unless meant that we loose also period couple commas would helped lack of periods is probably why shes being such a bitch well played sir hahaha i see what you did there  lack of it would be the other way aroundedit alright i was wrong sorry guys i completely forgot about menopause menopausewikipedia for the lazy im more worried about how much t is i mean is that like  x texas cause i definitely cant afford gas for that also   i feel bad for you i think you meant commas sorry no my jokes dont work on the internetedit jokes  its called ignorance unfortunately its rampant the  age groups cant wait the baby boomers to die this country move grow stalled outdated bullshit beliefs based invisible man up the clouds really like the ones who raised you and housed you and paid for your college education and your first car  the ones who invented the internet landed on the moon etc  yeah all old fools yup because all the people  helped create the internet and land on the moon they also all helped pay me to go to college and buy my first caroh thats right im twenty two and had to work at a chevron and a call center to afford my first caroh wait i couldnt afford college with minimum wage jobs and had to spend hours teaching myself a skill set so i could happily say in  months ill be celebrating my third year employed as a software engineer without having to take out massive student loans i do however thank my parents for housing and raising mei do also condemn the masses of ignorant uneducated entitled  year olds that raised their children on hate and blind faith which will unfortunately plague this country well into the futureremember not everyone that makes it is a spoiled middle class suburbanite relax opinions are clearly changing once we all start pooping out kids things will be different i can feel it  ima hoping so  op said cant wait for all the baby boomers to die outall means every single one regardless of whether theyre a tea party loon your parents or the creators of the internet i certainly dont want all of them to die out although obviously they will but saying i cant wait for all of them to die is a terrible thing to say it lumps in all the good people with the bad and is basically saying fuck people over  deleted this man is right stop being selfrighteous smartasses i do have one thing to add though the pluses arent going to matter when the minuses grow up with the same mentality just look at all the ignorant facebook posts by teens after the election most of which are ignorantly regurgitating whatever they hear their misguided parents saying i know they will but its not a good thing to wish speedy death upon an entire demographic those would have changed the meaning so that it more clearly referred to only the subset of baby boomers that you assert that he is referring to it does not take much effort to change one common word into another common word masses of ignorant uneducated entitled  year olds  is an interesting take what is it that you are so pissed about you sound pretty intolerant for an openminded enlightened selfmade realist   to modify your words a little remember not every  boomer that makes it is a ignorant uneducated entitled person     lulz i suppose after reading back over my comment i guess the tone could have changed up a biti dont think its a majority of baby boomers i just think a huge number of them are disconnected from the youth of today i see a lot of attitudes that insinuate the youth of today are whiny and prefer to see things done as they have been done which simply do not translate into todays issues and problemswit that being said i do and have been working with primarily  of my development team baby boomers and find them all to be awesome people and almost entirely down to earthto answer your actual question p i get quite upset when i see people who feel like they have worked hard for what they have and see the younger generations as being incompetent or lazy for not being able to play ball at the same level they were at the ages  and the entitlement that comes with that does actually cause me fits of anger with that said i am pretty tolerant and if i meet you and you happen to be a fifty five year old successful human being i will give you the same chance i would a   or  year old to make an impression in all honesty my response was originally just a quip and than i added my personal aspect of it which as usual causes the tone to change into a negative one didnt mean to hate i just find the need more and more to explain away our generations gripes and qualms about where we are i promise i dont think your all uneducated luddites hell bent on the youngins being socialists tldr sorry bro the ones who did the last two things you listed would probably not align themselves with the tea party given that both were accomplished with high levels of big government involvement read this the comment just said all baby boomers didnt say just the tea partiers tea party who said anything about tea party if youre having a tea party im in gtwho said anything about tea partythe conspiracy theoryxenophobe type nonsense shown in the link has been widely embraced by the tea party the tea party also has wide support in the  age group mentioned in the post you replied to which was about moronic bigoted fuddy duddies soon dying off i merely inferredanyhow the seniors who participated in nasa and the formation of the internet while over  are hardly likely to be part of the idiotic knownothing demographic about which cabbadabbadoo complained this was my point if your objection to cabba was just that some  year olds did cool intelligent things like nasa then your point was irrelevant cabbadabbadoo was clearly not talking about all  year olds but rather a subset of  year olds in which most nasa engineersscientists would not be includedthe idiots you can call this subset whatever you like because of the high correlation i called it the tea party in my post semanticsedit also you make a lot of assumptions about his parents he could be a voter and still have parents under  further he could have parents that werent worth a damn and didnt feed and house him nearly as well as they should have andor that did not pay for his schooling some people pay their own ways again the demographic he condemned was all people over  not just those that are idiots and knownothings oh please it is called context and you are completely ignoring it the op was about an ignorant old xenophobe the words of cabba immediately preceeding your citation were about utter ignorance being common in a particular demographic the words immediately following it were about allowing religious beliefs to dictate political stance to the point of ignoring fact and common sense it is highly unlikely that cabba literally believes or meant that all over s are ignoramuses guilty of the sins he describes  just that too high a percentage of them are use of the word all was blatant hyperbole and you are seeking drama by choosing to interpret this single word literally when the context contraindicates this if your only objection is to the word all and the use of hyperbole you are a nitpicking fuckhead who is wasting everyones timeedit punctuation the use of the word all instead of all those or something else completely changes what the statement means from reading his other comments i dont think this interpretation is obvious at all let me guess youre one if them and no one paid for me to go to college or for my first car i was brought up to work for what i wanted  i bought my cars and paid my way thru college i lifeguarded worked construction farm work factories etc before and during college  i paid as i went got no grants no scholarships no loans if i was short on cash i took fewer classes if i had the opportunity i worked extra shifts or overtime i bought used textbooks and skipped some i ate lots of mac and cheese i made my lunch i appreciate that you made your own way  dont beat me up over it  my point is that you are generalizing about old fools like some old fools generalize about todays youth  we all get frustrated with someone  i think the smart move is to generalize less and listen more ask for an explanation of someones opinion honest question im europe why they hes muslim i middle hussein that the reason they want to say nigger but they know that people woundnt take them seriously so instead they say either muslim or communist   when the ignorant say communist i always respond with well what is a communist and stare at them until they stumble their way around the question you dont know study it out then youll see i love you for referencing that video and none of them even know what a communist or a socialist actually are and honestly they probably have never even met a muslim because theyre a bunch of racist ignorant douche bags that have to make shit up to sway all their associated assholes beliefs in case they might actually vote for a decent person and not their white rich american poster boy fuck moromney i initially thought it was because his father was muslim but then found out his father was actually atheist somaybe because he lived in indonesia for awhile but indonesia has a large nonmuslim population tooi guess youre right it must be because of the muslimsounding name hussein gtobama sr was raised in a muslim family but converted to anglicanism and changed his name from baraka to the more christiansounding barack when he was about six years old at the insistence of the christian missionary schools he attended he became an atheist as a young man before meeting his second wife ann dunham he got it from his father  barack obama sr senior inherited that name from his father after converting to islam  onyango obama i think youre giving them too much credit its more of a kneejerk racist reaction because the really dumb part of the population that does not understand anything about what is going on in the world and are easily stoked by manipulative media have fetishized  in their feeble minds they have conflated all kinds of things together and started using the word muslim synonymously with other things they dont like and are angry about like black people  because of poorly edited new reportssomeone posted this on my fb  i responded with who cares  i thought this was a free country  who can worship what they want dat comment section  whooo i wasnt to reply to the way i think reality this point life gti wasnt sure how else to reply to her by the wayi will remind you of this conversation in  when all that stuff you said will have never happenedsomething along those lines didnt people say all this rubbish four years ago yes their reason now is because he wont have to worry about election which i guess means itll all definetely happen now ive never understood that he had  years to do it then or  years to do it now  if he really was converting the us to a communist muslim state why would he wait and risk not getting elected before trying to initiate his evil master plan  depending on how rabid she is i will remind you of this in  when you are  years dead from bigoted xenophobic apoplexy and none of that stuff has happened may be more appropriate i liked your response especially the last line instead of dulled your respect i would have said annihilated how people this uneducated where they this ridiculous information gtthe fourth july will celebrated christmas wont celebratedwhere the world they this information i dont know where she got this information but i have a strong hunch it came from fox news news being a part of their name otherwise i would have left it out as it does not aptly describe the goals of that organization it sounds like the kind of sentiment that stems from the glenn beck and bill oreilly types the place i ate lunch today had fox news on and t was scary what they were saying its straight fear mongering they were talking about how the economy was doomed and that within the next four years it was a high probability that the united states would cease to exist thats not a joke they actually said that fox news is reckless and dangerous  fear mongering is exactly right think of the millions of people that view fox news as the sole source of reliable information scary stuff scary stuff indeed my favorite sentiment about fox new comes from john stewart he said something along the lines of it is a major problem that more people from your organization believe that the president is a muslim than believe in evolution he was talking to bill oreilly at the time that truly is a very scary thought that people are running around and procreating with that mentality as one of their core beliefs my mother is convinced that obama is going to lead the country down the same road as communist china  she is literally afraid of what the future holds and whether shell be able to sustain herself financially  im not sure anything i say will convince her otherwise   yah china is doing so horrible now china would not be so powerful if the united states wasnt so stupid  we have basically handed them the world on a silver platter yea scared mom logic doesnt compute that the place i was eating lunch was owned by immigrants from eastern europe  have you ever met an eastern european immigrant that was a democrat  nope  and the reason for that is because they come here to run away from oppression and most either remember the communists or have parents that do  the republicans have done a fantastic job at making sure these immigrants think that democrats want to turn the united states into what they ran away fromive tried to talk to the owner about this a few times were pretty friendly  he pretty much refuses to accept that republicans are just using him and fear mongering  ive known a few eastern european immigrants from other jobs as well and they all think exactly the same way   seriously how can they get away with that because they won a case in court when they were sued a few years ago that they can outright lie to their viewers  they have no legal responsibility to report the truth  there is of course a code of ethics and a moral right to honestly report the news but fox news doesnt believe or care about that  while the point of any news agency print tv or otherwise is to make money since its a business most news agencies at least try to report truth but with a twist to help their agenda  fox news goal is to put their agenda first and not let truth get in the way of that latenight conservative talk on am radio stations thats the kind of information they get from church their pastor would have done a sermon on it gtcelebratged from commentators on sites such as free republic etc these people take comments such as mine here as facts    today was actually the first day in a very long time i visited free republic and i was overjoyed to witness the gnashing of teeth and total despair at display it was hilarious what im a tad bit confused facebook does major issue with people who write loose losei swear blood curdle youd think that by her age shed know better shows how educated the average person who falls for republican propaganda is  proofreader here yes yes i do i have a bigger issue with the actual content of her comment but yes i have an issue with alot i typically tend to side with the conservativeshowever this election i to with obama not that matters i live texas think was the s that texas went blue regardlesswhen parents i was voting obama this year they this email with bullsht that i hard time believing these were the people who raised me oh cancelled national day prayer respect the flag the america flag removed air force one longer cabinetthe list on i replied debunking that was listed their email i hear them

told gtoh he cancelled national day of prayer he doesnt respect the flag and had the america flag removed from air force one he no longer has a cabineti go into crazy rages when people seriously believe andor pass on stupid facts that are easily disproved it doesnt even have to be about politics or religion willful ignorance just makes me livid how t trillion  trilliongallon just like in

cohosts offox  friendssaturdaydiscussed theclosureof the world war ii memorial whichresultedfrom the republicanled shutdown during the discussion cohost anna kooiman claimed that while the memorial is closed president obama has offered to pay out of his own pocket for the museum of muslim culture  kooiman the republican national committee is offering to pay for it to keep it open so that the veterans from honor flight are going to be able to go and see this because who did it honor it honored them it really doesnt seem fair especially  and were going to talk a little bit later in the show too about some things that are continuing to be funded and president obama has offered to pay out of his own pocket for the museum of muslim culture out of his own pocket yet its the republican national committee whos paying for this unfortunately for kooiman the claimthat obama offered to pay out of pocket for a museum of muslim culture originated from thesatirical website the national report as thefactcheckingsite snopescompoints out a nowremoveddisclaimeron the national report noted national report is a news and political satire web publication which may or may not use real names often in semireal or mostly fictitious ways all news articles contained within national report are fiction and presumably fake news fox has ahistoryofpassing off satirical stories as actual news updateon october  kooiman issued the followingstatementvia twitter just met w producers i made a mistake yday after receiving flawed research abt a museum possibly closing my apologies wont happen

making a bad mistake reporting a story that was not true i wanted to get to this this morning  last weekend we mentioned a story about the president funding a muslim museum during the shutdown we made a bad mistake by reporting a story based on poor research that was not true we apologize for not checking the facts and for allowing the story to make air our blog section features rapid response factchecks of conservative misinformation links to media criticism from around the web commentary analysis and breaking news from media matters senior fellows investigative team researchers and other staff conservative media figures criticizedthe obama administration for suggesting terrorism is tied to poverty ignoring the fact thatformerpresidentgeorge wbushalsoexplicitlycited alleviatingpoverty asafundamental tool to fightingterrorism ","commentContent":"falls for i to wonder that fox deliberately airs misleading antagonistic story  feigns surprise when caught yeah just like whenever the spell it osama instead of obama accidentally qhich theyve done multiple times funny how no other channel has ever done it even once anytime a republican gets caught up in a nasty scandal they have a history of accidentally putting a d after the name as well wow thats incredibly malicious source a bit old but theres multiple stories about them doing iti dont keep up with fox so i dont know if theyre still doing it but theyve done it in the past theyve also photoshoppedpeople to make them look more haggard manipulatetheir graphs and math show unrelated video of crowds to make their tea party rallies look bigger etc none of this is illegal because its entertainment not news its allowed to be fictional fox news  a bunch of old white guys in a circlejerk with sean hannity and oreilly being the whore in the middle no none of it is illegal simply because freedom of speech and lies being constitutionally protected the us doesnt and shouldnt have any laws on what a news outlet can and cant report regardless of it being news or entertainment  they also showed videos of riots in some southern state and claimed it was a teachers union strike in the midwest there were a surprising number of palm trees in the midwest that day i remember hearing one of those breaking scandal stories predicting they would be tagged with a d on fox then going to the fox page video and voila there was the d tag on the republican congressman yeah i love that one that works both ways  oh please im sure many people had assumed wallace was a republican as he was a homophobic xenophobic racist redneck son of a bitch easy mistake for chris hayes or anyone else to makefox on the other hand is deliberately malicious consistently and unapologetically taking blatantly false negative information and associating it with their political oppositionso not that works both ways  apples and oranges havent you heard its called the land of equality because if youre a jerk a thousand times youre still no better than the guy who was a jerk a handful of times without having looked extensively at lies most news organizations have done the liberal news media has more that stand out to melike the complete misrepresentation of the trayvon martin caseor the misrepresentation of syria see both sides do it as long as you can find one example of other side doing it  it works  one example hey guys both ways gt qhich theyve done multiple timesyou spelled quiche wrong dude you spelled quran wrong osama  i wonder if there is a political corollary to godwins law involving calling someone a socialistterroristcommunist  there must be as a political discussion grows longer the probability of a comparison involving socialists terrorists or communists approaches  excentinels law this could also be shortened to excens law if necessary is this law ruined by the gop these days quiche could happen to anybody where will you be when the quiche kicks in probably on the toilet dairy issues his point is still correct however yeah i just got a galaxy note ii and i live it except fir the fact that it has no spell check a serious lapse imo ha when bush was president it was always president bush obama is always mr obama  post screen caps to rshittynews qhich a spelling mistake in a comment about spelling mistakes enfinity cell phone damned auto correct thats more like it i bet they wont even admit to their audience they were wrong or if they do theyll be smarmy about it and imply it might as well have been true even if they admitted they were wrong ninetenths of their audience would believe it didnt bill o say publicly that republicans had to let go of the birth certificate nonsense and yet every braindead fox viewer still believes that obama was born in kenya yep they know that if they air misinformation and piss people off telling people the truth doesnt necessarily change their mind even if it came from the same source once its a macro and posted on facebook it might as well be a fact its okay because theyll redact it so briefly and vaguely their viewers will just keep repeating the story as truth anyway  much more appropriate title when did they admit it was fake or tell their viewers it was fake the other networks do too just for the other end of the political spectrum they all pander to their audience citation turn on tv and watch news for approximately one hour remember the ar shotgun used at the naval yard cnn or how bout the doctored  call of the zimmerman case msnbc edit a more suitable citation for the more refined circlejerkeredit  here is some more evidence for anyone interested in such nonsense edit  lets not forget our friends at cnn the ar is about the furthest thing from a shotgun as you can get i am in disbelief that i am being downvoted any one who is even slightly reasonable can see that fox news is not any different than all the others except cspan which ironically nobody watches  youre getting downvoted because msnbc claims to be a progressive news network while foxnews claims to be fair and balanced the other mainstream networks arent nearly as biased as fox or msnbc because they have been brainwashed to believe their side is always correct they want fox viewers to think for themselves but cant even do so themselves heres one id suggest you also read a book like ben steins can america survive its a real eyeopener thats not really the same thing you cant say that here man the left is always correct honest mistake  you have got to be fucking kioh nevermind i automatically assumed sarcasm but thank you for pointing me to the username upvoted just for the username it was just to keep the obamamuslim rage thing going possibly as a distraction from the gop damaging the country its definitely true in the alternate reality of fox news  my favorite stephen colbert quotegtreality has a wellknown liberal bias i have always loved that quote which may why they propagandise against intellectuals so much and try to defund and marginalise scientistsyou really have to wonder about a bunch that are currently saying there needs to be more research to prove whether humans are actually responsible for climate change while simultaneously trying to kill climate research programmes they are just throwing shit against a wall to see what sticks  any credibility was tossed out the window years ago   think of all the money they save by not hiring an ombudsman for fact checking  i can imagine a mulderlooking foxnewsian with an i want to believe poster in his office except instead of truth about aliens it is lies about obama being muslim commie socialist terrorist unamerican black guy as an x files fan i laughed rather hard at this  i would watch the hell out of the fox files no i think the explanation is that noone with intelligence and selfrespect works for fox therefore most of the stupid journalists and commentators will over time end up at fox its like a natural dumb filter previously these people would have ended up getting out of journalism because high standards would weed them out anyway they just arent smart enough to detect when they are being spoofed  the single most important capability a journalism institution must have it is to avoid looking stupidof course in the us fox has the advantage of operating in a superdumb news environment something which isnt so in most other developed countries there are plenty of intelligent people working for fox news these people lack morals and are probably psychopaths gt ation is that noone with intelligence and selfrespect works for fox therefore most of the stupid journalists and commentators will over time end up at fox its like a natural dumb filter previously these people would have ended up getting out of journalism because highi remember a clip of fox from the daily show that showed one of their onair personalities acting like a dumb blonde stereotype the quote was ignoramus im going to have to look that up giggleturns out she has a phd and multiple degrees deleted awesome  thank you  fair point either way they seriously dont have an ombudsman for fact checking that was a conscious decision lol more like fox creates faux story im sure theyre crushed i think its nice that youre so concerned for their feelings exactly  the story fits their agenda  they are comfortable that although the story is fake they personally cant be accused of making it up  also any retraction will be almost invisible  added to the fact that their regular viewers will lap it up  i dont know about that theyre notorious for being the shittiest fact checkers on the face of the planet and theyve already learned their viewers have nowhere near the brain power to catch them at it and theyve been taught not to trust any information that doesnt come from the jesuss disciple the holy rupert murdoch sufficiently advanced stupidity is indistinguishable from malice ive heard this line of reasoning before and dont buy it sure fox aims to mislead its viewers however i dont think theyd go so far as to intentionally air easily disprovable lies doing so hurts their cause more than it helps just makes them look like bumbling idiotsits much safer to stick to misinformation for which a disingenuous argument can be made that way if someone calls them on their bullshit they can just muddy the waters or run out the clock in that case halfwit viewers will lose interest or get confused and go on to assume that fox was right all along why thier viewers never see the retraction or the sources that mock them for doing it and their hands are clean because its a mistake in order to maintain a patina of credibility fox hosts often need to debate liberals on the air if a challenger can quickly and clearly identify a falsehood fox loses face even on a nonlevel playing field one can only push things so faralso faithful viewers might occasionally interact with the world outside of the rightwing echo chamber if fox lies are sufficiently transparent even brief exposure to the real world might pierce a hole in their bubble of ignorancei dont necessarily claim that fox is above lying rather i think theyre smart enough to realize that doing so is not in their best interest at a minimum prevarications must be sufficiently complex that they cant be disproven in a matter of seconds or better yet fox can present information that is factually accurate yet intentionally misleading chrysler will build jeeps in china cover their asses with question marks is obama a us citizen hide behind anonymous third parties some people are saying etcof course there are zealots that will ignore irrefutable evidence perhaps thats the majority of foxs audience however not all viewers are equally blind and fox is presumably trying to expand its audience as well as glenn beck and rush limbaugh can attest everyone is subject to market forcesas for the unidirectionality of foxs factfudging i believe thats a consequence of a couple factors first of all its a conservative organization so theyre only trying to push the limit in one direction the situation is analogous to drivers getting more tickets for speeding rather than going too slow a second factor might be that within left wing circles proliberal errata wouldnt get much publicityi hate to defend fox news but its galling that we uncritically accept the argument that every falsehood is intentional its shit like this that propagates the rpolitics is a circlejerk meme you think these guys think this shit through thier contempt for their opponents is only exceeded by their contempt for their viewers they just get in there pump out some formule bullshit laugh about it and its off to the bar gt  i dont think theyd go so far as to intentionally air easily disprovable lies doing so hurts their cause more than it helpsdoesnt work that way though i have relatives who watch fox news religiously you can hand them documented proof that something shown on that channel was wrong and theyll change the subject or come up with some cockamamie rationalization people believe things that support their preconceptions evidence be damned also fox news has too long and consistent a record of fudging facts in one direction only for it to be an accident okay but they also realize that they are their viewers only news source so if they do make garbage up their ratings wouldnt take a hit no matter how frequently it happensi do agree that they prefer to just twist things but they arent above lying except they have made these  mistakes over and over again i would recommend you swing by the homepage of the site they got this story from  some of the stories posted include jesus boycotting hobby lobby police tasering kindergarten kids for the heck of it and an arms company selling their new trayvon pk   plenty of people fall for stupid shitfor all we know some hungover intern is responsible play to their audience  criticise the liberal media if caught seen more of fox neww lately as its one of two news sources here and sweet jesus its worst than you can begin to imagineconversely al jazeera is very good they fall it they up themselves sold to their ignorant base who eats this shit up the bowl full can confirm i work for a group of southerners and had to explain to them that obama wasnt born and raised in kenya they truly believe that shit im related toknow a handful of people like that  i wonder if i can convince them that ted cruz is secretly a hardcore canadian and much like obama wants to bring about the downfall of the us  theyre actually working in tandem to destroy our great nationnah wont work  cruz has an r in front of his name the party label is all the matters anymore its a signal to identify which side of the culture wars you are on isnt birtherism just coded racism they cant call him a ngger so they use the bs as code that would explain why birthers are concentrated in the south what does that confirmedit no one else thinks that what deepsandwich said does not qualify as confirming the parent comment oh please it just confirms that deepsandwich worked with some ignorant southerners all it does is jump on a south is ignorant bandwagon which is quite the karma train around here that people will buybelieve anything they want to if it falls into place with their worldviewbecause it makes sense to themwere all guilty of this to some degree no one is completely unbiased or perfectly neutral to everythingits just that some people are more egregious a lot more than others when it comes to shit like this gtit makes sense to themwind is gods way of balancing heat wind is the way you shift heat from areas where its hotter to areas where its cooler thats what wind is wouldnt it be ironic if in the interest of global warming we mandated massive switches to energy which is a finite resource which slows the winds down which causes the temperature to go up now im not saying thats going to happen mr chairman but that is definitely something on the massive scale i mean it does make some sense you stop something you cant transfer that heat and the heat goes up its just something to think aboutreminds me of that this quote is by joe bartonif anyone else was wondering the same guy who apologized to bp over the gulf oil disaster jesus that is about the stupidest thing ive ever read their base will believe it though how come these asshats are always calling everyone morons and talking about common sense  fucking morons because god im sorry but if you replace god with everything you dont understand  that seems stupid im not against believing in a god though i am an atheist myself just when you dont understand something fully and you say things like that it makes you seem dumb makes you seem dumbmakes you dumb luckily everyone is free to believe whatever they feel is right in regards to a higher power or spirit regardless of whether someone else thinks its dumbi mean i agree that it seems a bit selflimiting to not seek an answer for things that you dont know whether its an outside fact or a reason within to help you understand but it just feels a bit narcissistic to call somebodys beliefs dumb or that their beliefs make them dumb when its so entirely subjective  this is one of the best and most accurate observations ive seen  great comment  maybe so but i think he could have been a bit more tactful funny i was thinking a bit less tactful would have been entirely appropriatetheres times to be kind times to be scholarly and times to just flatout take the clue stick upside peoples heads im curious how you feel he could have been more tactful i thought that he made his point without being too harsh or insensitive on the contrary i found it quite tactful  hes a bluntperson  its just his nature youre correct though some people are willfully biased and others make an effort to gain perspective typically everyone is willfully biased about something or other and makes an effort to gain perspective on other things which things they remain biased about and which things they are willing to gain more perspective on can be more or less reliably predicted based on the ensemble of things they already believe or know they will resist gaining perspective on things that would require radically altering some part of their belief system and will be willing to gain perspective on other things that dont require such alterationthis phenomenon is called cognitive dissonance and its absolutely pervasive being one of the most fundamental models in social psychologyits no coincidence that as far as libertarians are concerned modern economic theory stopped developing after von mises and rothbard its no coincidence that as far as liberals are concerned making guns illegal will stop gunrelated deaths its no coincidence that for conservatives understanding the actual mechanics and science and evidence behind climate change is a waste of time because its obviously bullshit everyone  you me everyone  has subjects like this and the kicker is that were mostly unaware of themthere are just some subjects that make us well uncomfortable and we avoid them cognitive dissonance is the reason some people are also intentionally or not exposed more often to other worldviews and it opens up perspective your experiences with people have made you biased about how biased people arei however am completely unbiased that people buy the bullshit how much is it its about tree fiddy it actually started on the national review a satire site like the onion but conservative in nature  ah rpolitics  ill fox credit they up this story someone fox to find it and  months you fox viewer what the president the shut down they would funded mosque i saw a louisianan poll the other day that showed that half of those polled blame obama for the response to hurricane katrinait wont even taken  months  hey in their defense how much did he really do to help the victims of katrina as a senator from illinois sarcasm  it was  of louisiana republicans not half of those polled  so  of the idiots in louisiana are complete fucking retards nah  dont understand the polling question wait what  katrinaplease post the sauce  gta third of louisiana republicans blame obamaokay in the article to says the number is  and  blame bush so it should also mention a third also blame bush the  dont know who to blame was pretty comical still a scary high number blaming obama though hurricane katrina d  thanks obama thats hilarious i have to laugh so i dont cry not hilarious terrifying it probably wont take  months he means mo from now thats what someone will remember about the shutdown and i mean that it wont take  month for them to remember that about it i give them negative credit because a news organization if you can call them that is supposed to fact check and not simply take things that they read off some guys blog and report them as facts  find it  their audience sends this stuff in to them its cheaper than hiring reporters deleted yeah but were a bunch of douchebags who dont get paid didnt go to school for this and this isnt our career  fox news on the other hand is a professional news organization with a history of making these types of mistakes and many others consistently and in the same directionat this point its no longer about exposing fox news for their blatant bias and lies everyone knows the score its about calling them on it each and every timerepublicansconservativescrazies need their own news station they wont accept any other the other ones as fair and balanced as they may be they want one that is ridiculously biased and ignorant and they have it and they watch it and it will stick aroundwe have to call them out on their bullshit each time to mitigate the damage they do to the noncrazies who hear their shit youre right the anonymous people posting articles on a website shouldnt be running an alleged news organizationperfectly fair comparison bro ombudsman you mean that guy we stuck in our closet examples evidence alright that they was fake when will they report their retraction good one hahaha  pm in the middle of the commercial breaks or foxnewsfoxnewsnetstoryretractonourbadweresureyoullfibdthisstorypdfbehind a paywall gt  pmi believe you mean am right in the middle of nap time and youll never fibd this story because we purposefully made our url unfibdable suck it losers  i mean viewers dont hold your breath actually if youre a fox news viewer please keep holding your breath its one of the many things the govment dont want you to do keep holding it thats good a little bit more dont be alarmed if you are starting to see some black spots and your chest is starting to hurt a little bit  those are just the telltale signs of your body adapting to the governmentfree environment keep holding it and if you can manage it try to strap a plastic bag over your head and secure it around your neck firmly with some good strong tape this is to prevent emergency systems that government implanted into you at birth that will try to start breathing in some nonfreedom air againand at the end of the process youll have a complete body shutdown slimdown ready for a new brave world im moderate republican this pissing off fox making us bunch uncultured fuckwads that this propaganda i think you are in the wrong party  the republican party is the party of uncultured fuckwads now  the sane guys should reform the bull moose party  i could vote for those guys i know quite a few republicans and from what i can tell there is a lot of infighting between tea partiers and moderate conservatives the moderate ones wish the tea party would stop driving their party down into the ground i dont know ive slowly watched the sanest republicans i know turn into weird conspiracy theorists and anyone that doesnt believe obama is a marxist is a liberal hippie commie pinko lazy piece of shit i went the other way i used to be a  out of  on the republican scale and now im like a  i know the feeling  im a registered republican that has voted for obama twice this crazy rhetoric that gets votes sarah palin js the republican partys worst enemy and they cant stop  gt infighting between tea partiers and moderate conservativesobviously theres a lot of fighting between tea party and democrats link to a forum post i lurk conservative forums to see their viewpoints and i dont see any kind of big dissent if someone brings up any kind of criticism towards repiblicans then somehow it deloves into a discussion about obama god fucking damn this bull moose thing is a good idea  wanna feel even worse check out the comment sectionof that satire article they quoted tldr ignorance hate and nationalism goddamnit why did i go and read the comments sigh i need to drink now whats the worst is that th actual fuckwads who believe this shir and only watch fox news come in to work and try to spread this shit or make arguments out of the crap they hear on fox news  i actually told this one thundercunt that i wont even engage in an discussions with her because the just regurgitates this nonsense constantly  which political party thinks we shouldnt invest in renewable resources higher education or international relations hence why i am a moderate republican i do like those things i also like a bunch more things that the republicans do womens rights separation of church and state and the provision of subsidised healthcare cable news is all about ratings unfortunately the number of people who want to hear this garbage outnumber the people who dont anyone else think we should burn fox studios we all need to stop equating democrats with liberalism and republicans with conservative these are just parties vying for control twisting and manipulating a gullible citizenry political philosophy cannot be reduced to blue or red right or wrong americans are skipping out on great literature and going for the picture books become a democrat obama is pretty much an eisenhower republican this kind of thing isnt a fox problem its a modern journalism problem gtfox history passing satirical stories actual news gtgtfox has a history of passing off fabricated stories as actual news ftfy true  it matter their viewers what they want to believe if fox spent entire day explaining that they
