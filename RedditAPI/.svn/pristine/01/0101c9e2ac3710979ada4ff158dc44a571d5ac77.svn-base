Mine is actually your argument. When someone says \"Obama tried to close Guantanamo.\" Big /r/politics talking point.\n\nGlenn Greenwald has been harping on this one, because it is really just a leftist misinformation when you actually look at the details. I\u0027ll cite a couple of articles from him.\n\nThis is from back in July, when[ the administration imposed harsher rules](http://www.salon.com/2012/07/23/the_obama_gitmo_myth/) for prisoners in Guantanamo:\n\n\u0026gt;The New York Times Editorial Page today denounced these new rules as “spiteful,” cited it as “the Obama administration’s latest overuse of executive authority,” and said “the administration looks as if it is imperiously punishing detainees for their temerity in bringing legal challenges to their detention and losing.” Detainee lawyers are refusing to submit to these new rules and are asking a federal court to rule that they violate the detainees’ right to legal counsel.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;But every time the issue of ongoing injustices at Guantanamo is raised, one hears the same apologia from the President’s defenders: the President wanted and tried to end all of this, but Congress — including even liberals such as Russ Feingold and Bernie Sanders — overwhelming voted to deny him the funds to close Guantanamo. While those claims, standing alone, are true, they omit crucial facts and thus paint a wildly misleading picture about what Obama actually did and did not seek to do.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;What made Guantanamo controversial was not its physical location: that it was located in the Caribbean Sea rather than on American soil (that’s especially true since the Supreme Court ruled in 2004 that U.S. courts have jurisdiction over the camp). What made Guantanamo such a travesty — and what still makes it such — is that it is a system of indefinite detention whereby human beings are put in cages for years and years without ever being charged with a crime. President Obama’s so-called “plan to close Guantanamo” — even if it had been approved in full by Congress — did not seek to end that core injustice. It sought to do the opposite: Obama’s plan would have continued the system of indefinite detention, but simply re-located it from Guantanamo Bay onto American soil.\n\n\nThis other one is from last month, when a[ prisoner was found dead](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/11/guantanamo-prisoner-death-democrats) in his cell. \n\n\u0026gt;That\u0027s because Obama\u0027s plan was not so much to \"close Gitmo\" as it was simply to relocate it a few thousand miles north onto US soil, with its system of indefinite detention – which makes the camp so odious – fully preserved. That is why civil liberties groups such as the ACLU harshly denounced Obama\u0027s plan as \"Gitmo North\". As the ACLU explained, long before Congress obstructed what Obama wanted to do, \"the administration plans to continue its predecessor\u0027s policy of indefinite detention without charge or trial for some detainees, with only a change of location.\"\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;Indeed, as I documented several months ago, the system of indefinite detention from the start has been central to Obama\u0027s plan for these detainees. Put another way, even if Congress had given Obama everything he wanted, the system that means that death is the only way out for many detainees would have been fully preserved. The excuse-making for Obama – \"oh, he tried to close the camp but Congress would not let him\" – is simply a deceitful tactic Democrats have concocted to justify their total silence about a grave injustice they once pretended to find so appalling and their raucous swooning for a president who supports it.\n\nIn that last article there\u0027s a great quote from Bush\u0027s former NSA and CIA director, General Michael Hayden, proving what should be the most ignored detail from partisan liberals.\n\n\u0026gt;\"President Barack Obama has closely followed the policy of his predecessor, President George W Bush, when it comes to tactics used in the \u0027war on terror\u0027 – from rendition, targeted killings, state secrets, Guantánamo Bay to domestic spying, according to Michael Hayden, Bush\u0027s former director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;\"\u0027But let me repeat my hypothesis: Despite the frequent drama at the political level, America and Americans have found a comfortable center line in what it is they want their government to do and what it is they accept their government doing. It is that practical consensus that has fostered such powerful continuity between two vastly different presidents, George W Bush and Barack Obama, when it comes, when it comes to this conflict,\u0027 Hayden said Friday while speaking at the University of Michigan …\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;\"\u0027And so, we\u0027ve seen all of these continuities between two very different human beings, President Bush and President Obama. We are at war, targeted killings have continued; in fact, if you look at the statistics, targeted killings have increased under Obama.\u0027\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;\"He said that was the case because, in one differing path between the two presidents, Obama in 2009 closed CIA \u0027black sites\u0027 and ratcheted down on torturing detainees. But instead of capturing so-called \u0027enemy combatants\u0027, President Obama kills them instead, Hayden said.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;\"\u0027We have made it so politically dangerous and so legally difficult that we don\u0027t capture anyone anymore,\u0027 Hayden said. \u0027We take another option, we kill them.

For example, it has restricted arms transfers to Myanmar, China, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in addition to countries subject to UN arms embargoes.

It provides Colombia’s security forces with arms, military aid and training, despite their persistent violations of human rights. \n\n\u0026gt;**Stance on the ATT:** \nSince October 2009, when the Obama administration reversed previous opposition to an ATT, US support has been crucial in getting to the current negotiation stage. The US has said it wants the treaty to raise the international standard for export control of armaments as close as possible to that of the US. **However, the US position is weaker on human rights protection in the treaty than many of its allies.** For example, **US officials have not wanted to include obligations on states to prohibit transfers of arms even where there is credible evidence of their potential use for serious violations of human rights.** US officials have also argued against including ammunition under the scope of the treaty, claiming it is too sensitive and would pose technical problems of implementation.

This is the most deluded narcissism and the biggest insult to Muslims.  Islam has been causing problems since its start.  You know the first war the U.S. had to fight abroad was due to Muslim sponsored and rationalized pirates who were plaguing commerce in the Mediterranean.  They would take peole as slaves off ships and demand randsoms and protection money.  The Barbary Wars.  Look into it.  One of the reasons the U.S. decided to go from the Articles of Confederation to the Constitution was the Muslim menace.  We had to establish the U.S. Navy to deal with rampant piracy.  When Jefferson demanded an explanation for Muslim perfidy in the region the diplomat explained that Muslims were not bound to respect any treaties with infidels and that their holy book justified all that they did to Americans.","Being Muslim is bad if it means you think Mohammed was a good guy and role model.  If being Muslim means pretending to believe the harmful ideology of your parents until they die so that you can inherit their stuff and then live according to something better than the Koran, well then being a Muslim isn\u0027t too bad.","In American politics it is not good for a candidate to be sincerely Muslim because Islam is not \"just another religion\" but a political philosophy as well.

He didn\u0027t just start a big religion, but an empire.  He didn\u0027t just inspire people\u0027s religious fantasies, but dreams of conquest.  Islamic values are not compatible with the form of democratic republic we have in the United States or most developed nations.  Sharia is not compatible with our conception of human rights and due process.  It is a crime punishable by death to leave Islam in Islamic nations, but in the U.S. we value religious freedom.

If someone tells me they\u0027re a Nazi I should be able to guess they think Hitler had some good ideas and aspirations, at the very least.  You need to think more critically.

I think Blair wouldn\u0027t have been worse or better had he been allowed to convert and that the U.K. should do away with that restriction.\r\n\r\nAs for a Muslim becoming President of the United States of America, perhaps we should think hypothetically about members of other religions being elected to the most powerful office on the planet.  Should Americans consider electing a candidate who declares he is personally a devout Satanist but that his private worship of the devil in no way would influence how he leads the nation?  Let\u0027s say a Branch Davidian wanted to be elected President and when pressed declared that David Koresh was a prophet but that what happened at Waco was a moment from his religion\u0027s past, should people accept that this private religious affiliation didn\u0027t have bearing on leadership ability?  Maybe a practitioner of Ayum Shinriko wants to rule, does this strike anyone as troubling?\r\n\r\nIn the largely secular West people tend to think of religion as little more than a private tradition which takes up at most an hour or so on the weekends, but this is not the case for sincerely devout people.  A devout Jew is Jewish not just on Saturdays and the same goes for anyone who is sincerely religious.  Different belief systems lead to different world views.

Under that Act, two groups of people became \"British subjects\"; the first were people from the [Republic of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland) born before 1949 who already claimed subject status, and the second covered a number of people who had previously been considered \"British subjects without citizenship\", and were not considered citizens of any other country.

Fox news must be pleased."],"carrboneous":["Of course Jewish Law could dictate such things. Halacha must have an opinion on everything, and especially things which have applicability to Jews, into which category the religion of others certainly falls (how could a Sanhedrin prosecute people for idolatry otherwise?) (And indeed, it is the halacha that Jews follow the maternal line while non-Jews follow the paternal line, generally speaking).\n\nThat said, I don\u0027t think we care what religion someone is born; it literally makes no difference, because we care about what people do (and believe), and are less concerned about their genetic heritage or upbringing. Halachically, he\u0027s not Jewish, that\u0027s all that\u0027s really important of that. I don\u0027t think halacha does follow heredity for religion.\n\nThat said, there is definitely an essentialist perspective common in the Midrash and Rishonim, and even Chumash. Obviously, whether or not to subscribe to such a perspective will differ with approaches to Chazal in general (personally, I find the evidence too compelling to deny).\n\nHowever, I don\u0027t think it has any practical application. Except for Amaleik (and the Canaanites), a person\u0027s \"essential nature\", or tribe, should not count against them, as far as we are concerned, because we are only concerned about how they behave.\n\nSo, it might (or might not) make it easier to explain Obama\u0027s (or anyone\u0027s) behaviour and attitudes by fitting them into a Yisrael, Eisav, Ishmael schema, but it shouldn\u0027t make any difference to what we think of them, generally. So as long as your Rabbi isn\u0027t making any judgements on this point alone, I think he can believe whatever he believes about that point.\n\nHowever, I don\u0027t think it makes sense to base it on someone\u0027s converted religion. Bnei Ishmael are not Muslims — Ishmael was not a Muslim. Many Muslims are Ishmaelim, and Ishmael is important to Islam, but I see no reason to believe that anyone except Jews can adopt a nationality/ethnicity with conversion (that Yisrael can do so is similarly something attested by Chazal, as far as I know, but it is a unique situation). I also think it\u0027s generally an cultural/attitudinal determination, not a genetic one, even though there does seem to be a genetic component/correlation. (which could either support or undermine the claim that his father\u0027s Islam affects it). I don\u0027t know much about the Abarbanel, so I can\u0027t comment from the textual point of view.\n\nThat said, from what I understand of the Chazalic understanding of Eisav and Yishmael, I don\u0027t think Obama fits... He\u0027s very much an American phenomenon, it seems to me. Perhaps not the president America needs, but the president America deserves right now :P\n\ntl;dr I don\u0027t think it\u0027s completely out-of-line in principle, I really don\u0027t think it matters, and I think he\u0027s quite wrong about it (but I am unfamiliar with all the quoted sources).","I think you misunderstood my convoluted sentence, but I don\u0027t completely disagree with what you\u0027re saying.\n\nAlthough I do think that if someone says before a Beis Din \"I am a Canaanite worshipper of Baal and Asherah\", we probably don\u0027t need to see them bowing to idols.\n\nAnd I think it would certainly be relevant to halachot such as yayin nesech and the like.\n\nBut in general, my point was exactly what you\u0027re saying. It doesn\u0027t really matter to us what a non-Jew calls their religion, only what they do in terms of our laws. But sometimes there is an overlap (and there\u0027s no reason *in principle* why halacha shouldn\u0027t care what others\u0027 religions are, that is a misconception (that Judaism is down with relativistic morality and an everything goes approach to the spirituality of others)). But in this case, I don\u0027t think it makes any difference to halacha whether Obama is a Muslim (although if it does, it would be in his favour).","It\u0027s kind of funny, because there is bigotry embedded in your assumption that being (called) a Muslim is inherently a bad thing. Like only members of the Klan (and Orthodox people, who are apparently comparable...) would *dare* to call someone a Muslim, even if it made no difference to what they thought of that person or his (or her) standing in society or suitability for holding office.\n\nFrom a halachic point of view, it is likely much better than being either Christian or Atheist. Although I don\u0027t think that\u0027s how this Rabbi meant it. In fact, I think the way he meant it is completely neutral and moot (you know, those Orthodox Rabbis and their Pharisaic ways — endlessly splitting hairs on meaningless hypotheticals). (And incidentally, I disagree with the Rabbi that Obama is in any way a Muslim).","Yes, I\u0027m aware. But OP mentioned specifically that his Rabbi didn\u0027t mean it as a negative thing, just as an observation of what he perceives to be the halachic reality.\n\nYour only being able to see it as some sort of slur affirms the legitimacy of their bigotry (except that you disagree on the point of fact).\n\nIt\u0027s also pretty bigoted to put into the mouths or minds of Orthodox Jews that Liberal Jews are \"dirty\" (not to mention the associated implication that we\u0027re all bigoted or ok with bigotry).","Of course there is no Halachic reality that controls Islamic law. That is beyond dispute.\n\nBut there is Halachic reality that controls Halacha. And what race/religion another person is can very plausibly fall under that.\n\nYou are assuming that because somebody come to a certain conclusion he must share beliefs and outlooks with people who came to a similar conclusion **for completely different reasons**, based on completely different logic, with completely different implications to themselves, and completely different intent.\n\nThe fact that you can\u0027t separate the statement from the intent or the reasoning or anything else about the context indicates at least one kind of bigotry on your part.\n\nThe statement\n\u0026gt; I am a dirty Liberal Jew who goes to Conservative services\n\nindicates prejudice as well, but completely unrelatedly to the first indication.\n\n","I don\u0027t know why I\u0027ve had to go over this so many times.\n\nThere is definitely a nafka mina in a person\u0027s nationality.

I don\u0027t believe all Muslims are our enemies, however I do believe that Islam is a misogynistic, brutal, superstitious, somewhat aggressively militaristic doctrine that\u0027s harmful to humanity at large.  I recognize that individual Muslims can sometimes avoid literalism and avoid enacting the worst parts of the Islamic doctrine.  But I also recognize that as long as these \"moderates\" support the Islamic doctrine as is, together with all the ahadith and various hateful and bigoted commentaries by various clerics, they are passively and quietly promoting harm.  So these folks may be peaceful and reasonable in a day to day life one on one, but then when [this happens](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003ds9kAVlnGMTU), they won\u0027t send letters to this idiot, they won\u0027t speak up and condemn this hatred and intolerance.  These are not good behaviors.","\u0026gt;So, it\u0027s exactly like Christianity then, only with brown people.\n\nI would say that\u0027s a false equivalence.  I think that while there is a lot to criticize about both Christianity and Islam, Islam is not in fact exactly like Christianity.  Islam is markedly more brutal and markedly more militaristic and political than Christianity is, when it comes to central doctrinal writings and how they are usually interpreted.\n\nI don\u0027t know any Christian nation or even any currently practicing Christian sect that stones adulterers or amputates limbs for theft.  While Christians have crusaded in the past, there is no doctrinal support for crusading in the Bible.  At the same time, there is doctrinal support for military jihad in both the Qur\u0027an and ahadith, which are the doctrinal writings of Islam.\n\nSo, to my mind there are some significant differences between the Christian doctrine and the Islamic one.  I don\u0027t like either doctrine, but the Islamic doctrine is significantly more harmful.","And I do find both doctrines reprehensible, but not nearly in equal measure.\n\nIn Christianity Jesus overrides most of the nastiness from the Old Testament.  In Islam Mohammed positively asserts, defends and even performs nastiness from the Old Testament, plus he adds some of his own, like limb amputations (which, as far as I know, do not exist in the Old Testament, correct me if I am wrong).  Jesus stopped a stoning that was about to commence.  Mohammed would initiate the stonings rather than stop them.  I\u0027m just scratching the surface here.  There are lots of differences between Jesus and Mohammed.  Jesus preached to turn the other cheek and he practiced what he preached by allowing himself to be nailed to the cross.  Mohammed became a warlord later in his life.  Jesus didn\u0027t fuck anyone, as far as I know.  Mohammed fucked a 9 year old girl and he had many wives as well (I dislike polygamy too, but the 9 year old is unforgivable).  What a difference.\n\nI can\u0027t pretend that Islam is equally as bad as Christianity just to be politically correct on reddit.  I\u0027ve read enough of the Bible, Qur\u0027an and ahadith to know otherwise.","\u0026gt;Jesus did not change anything from the old testament\n\nNo, he did.  He definitely did change quite a few things.  I am well aware of the lines you are quoting too.  Do yourself a favor and look into it more.  He didn\u0027t change all of the Old Testament, but he certainly changes big chunks of it, and all changes for the better too.\n\nIf you compare personal conduct of Jesus and Mohammed, there is no ambiguity in my mind about who is morally superior.  I\u0027d be OK with someone trying to emulate Jesus, but I would definitely **not** be OK with anyone trying to emulate Mohammed.\n\nIt\u0027s definitely a great shame that Jesus didn\u0027t summarily cancel the Old Testament though.","\u0026gt;Counting the first, second, third, and modern crusades?\n\nI count doctrines first and foremost, and then I count how those doctrines influence the cultures adopting them second.\n\nSo yes, I am definitely counting the crusades (military adventures in the name of religion).  I count everything when I speak about Islam and Christianity here.","To the extent that is so, yes, definitely.  I would expect Christians to strongly and vocally oppose someone like Kony.  Similarly, when various Christian anti-gay bigots go to Uganda to proselytize, I\u0027d expect opposition from Christians.  Well, guess what?  I don\u0027t like Christians or Christianity.  It\u0027s just that Islam is worse, imo.  Ideally I don\u0027t want any Abrahamic religion to be practiced.  But if I had to pick either Christianity or Islam to be my neighboring doctrine of influence, I\u0027d pick Christianity over Islam any day.","I disagree with this analysis.  I know lots of areas that suffer from abject poverty which don\u0027t turn to any kind of fundamentalism.\n\nI also know fundamentalists which are more harmless the more hardcore they are: Jains.  The more fundamentalist a Jain is, the more harmless one is.","\u0026gt;If there were moderates would you hear them on FOX news ?\n\nHow about reddit?\n\n\u0026gt;Do Muslim moderates actively fit into the American narrative about Islam and its adherents ?\n\nBest way to find out is to talk to them yourself.  Seriously.  Internet is good for that.\n\n\u0026gt;Do you actively search for moderate Muslim opinions \n\nI mostly look at doctrinal writings, but I\u0027ve talked to Muslims a few times on reddit and offline.  I\u0027m not going to say they are all crazy lunatics, that\u0027s just false.  But plenty of times I talked to Muslims I walked away disappointed and sad.  They really don\u0027t say stuff I wish they would say.  And while I can see how they are aligning with the doctrine, in my mind I think, \"guys, don\u0027t you see how the doctrine is inadequate?\"  Of course once you become a true believer, and you accept that the doctrine is the word of the omniscient God, what chance is there to think critically about it?  So if you think I don\u0027t encounter this in a discussion with Muslims, you\u0027re wrong.\n\nAnyway, I don\u0027t really hate the individual Muslims, but I *am* concerned about the doctrine.  I worry that Muslims promote Islam without giving any thought to the impact the doctrine has on humanity.  I watched some conversion videos on youtube, and almost invariably the reason people convert to Islam is not because of the doctrine, but because of how good they feel about some Muslim friends on a personal level.  That\u0027s a serious concern because while these folks probably don\u0027t read all of Qur\u0027an, don\u0027t read ahadith, don\u0027t study Muslim history in all their gory details, may not know what \"Deobandi thinking\" is and so on, they decide it\u0027s a good idea to support and directly or indirectly help spread this dangerous doctrine just because they feel good about a person.  That\u0027s just unsound thinking.  If you\u0027re going to adopt a religion, nice community is a good thing for sure, but **do** check out the doctrine first and foremost, and try to understand what it is you are spreading.\n\nAlso people who hide the ugly side of the doctrine while putting out fuzzy feelings up-front are dishonest salesmen.  You know how lots of people get converted?  From Sufism.  And Sufis don\u0027t talk about amputating limbs.  They don\u0027t get on a podium and get angry like a lot of Muslim clerics.  They smile.  They are kind.  They talk about nice fuzzy mystical stuff.  They never mention the harsh side of Islam.  So... on one hand, as Muslims, Sufis are probably some of the better people.  But as salesmen for Islam, Sufis are the most dishonest salesmen.  They put forward the very best of Islam, and absolutely obscure or even deny the worst.  I can even see myself hanging out with a Sufi sheikh and enjoying it.  But I would never convert to Islam.  And I would lean over and whisper into the sheikh\u0027s ear, \"Don\u0027t convert anyone to Islam... just share your spiritual wisdom as is.\"  And thankfully I even know of some sheikhs who do exactly that, but not enough, imo.\n\nHow many Muslims say stuff like this, \"Converting to Islam is free, but if you ever de-convert, be careful, because a lot of Muslims believe that ideally you should be punished by death for apostasy!\"  If Muslims talked this way, I bet they\u0027d get a lot fewer converts.  That, and mentioning other similar things about Islamic doctrine, its often violent history and its often strict and intolerant culture would be an honest sales job at least.\n\nThing to remember is... while you may just want a bunch of cool buddies to hang with, someone else is going to read the doctrinal writings of Islam and actually take them both literally and seriously.  And then what?  What kind of world are we creating?","\u0026gt;You\u0027ve got to understand that most of that bullshit you see from extreme Muslims is cultural - not religious. \n\nSorry, I am in a firm disagreement with you here.\n\n\u0026gt;The regions where the muslim crazies come from didn\u0027t have the benefit of an age of reason\n\nWhy not?  Ever thought about it?\n\n\u0026gt;Religion is a part of it but it\u0027s not the whole picture..\n\nI agree.  But religion, sadly, is an important part of the whole picture.  Why so?  Because religious identity, sadly, is a very important kind of identity, still, for a lot of people.\n\n\u0026gt;Where are the Turkish suicide bombers?\n\nLet\u0027s wait.  Turkey is in the middle of Islamization.  Besides, Turkey\u0027s recent rulers have been militantly secularistic.  You can\u0027t give Turkey 100% credit for secularism that was not of their free will.  It\u0027s like giving USSR citizens credit for being atheistic at a time when atheism was a government mandate in USSR.  That\u0027s crooked thinking.\n\n\u0026gt;Canadian?\n\nWest.\n\n\u0026gt; German?\n\nWest.\n\n\u0026gt;Swedish?\n\nWest.\n\n\u0026gt;It\u0027s easy to blame Islam for some of the stupid shit muslim extremists do\n\nExtremism in the form of militancy is one of the problems.  But there are other problems.  Islamic attitude toward women.  Islamic attitude toward dogs and liquor.  Islamic ideas about punishment (very brutal and cruel).  Islamic attitude toward non-Muslims.  Islamic attitude toward apostasy.  In other words, even in a Muslim society where people don\u0027t strap the suicide vests on, you can often see the negative influence of Islam.  And the more Muslims in one place the worse it usually goes.  Muslims are at their best when they are very dispersed in low numbers across the West.  But get a bunch of them together, especially in the Middle East, Africa or India, and bad shit happens.  Militarism is just one bad dimension of Islam.  That\u0027s the jihad dimension.  But Islam has plenty of bad dimensions besides militarism.\n\n\u0026gt;if you blame Islam you\u0027re going to have to label every single moderate Muslim a potential extremist\n\nModerate Muslims provide a comfortable and supportive atmosphere for the more serious Muslims.  They may not support extremism directly, but they support a Muslim who is marginally more serious.  Then the marginally more serious Muslims supports another marginally more serious Muslim.  And so on.  So at the end of the day, everyone plays a part in making Islam what it is.  Moderates make Islam what it is by their silence and apathy in the face of Islamic excesses.  Also, even moderates won\u0027t criticize the Qur\u0027an.  \\*sigh\\*\n\nI don\u0027t want to sit here and pretend Islamic doctrine is acceptable when it isn\u0027t.  I don\u0027t want to slaughter every Muslim or anything like that.  In fact I want the wars to end as much as possible.  However, I also think we need to speak out about Islam.  We\u0027ve got to criticize it.","There is definitely a bit of reddit\u0027s own flavor of political correctness and groupthink.

First of all, I\u0027m voting for Barack Obama, so I don\u0027t want anyone claiming that I\u0027m speaking from a biased viewpoint.  During his time in Indonesia, Barack Obama was officially identified on scholastic records as a Muslim, at the request of his stepfather. Identification as a Muslim is NOT based on voluntary confession of the individual involved----it is a status designated by the head of that person\u0027s family.  In Obama\u0027s case, that person would have been his stepfather at the time--Lolo Sotero.   There is no legitimate dispute about that.  Obama was a registered Muslim for several years during his youth there.  At the age of 26, Obama then became a born-again Christian at Trinity Church of Christ.\r\n\r\nThe big question concerns whether Obama\u0027s childhood status as a Muslim in Indonesia was erased or invalidated by his conversion to Christianity.  Arguably, many Muslims would say that a baptism in a Christian church doesn\u0027t necessarily wipe out Obama\u0027s prior status.  It really depends on whom you ask.\r\n\r\nAgain, I\u0027m voting for Obama; but there is no question whatsoever that Barack Obama was a registered Muslim and in many parts of the world, would still be considered a Muslim today.  The bottom line is that fact shouldn\u0027t affect the decision of a conscientious, informed voter. The policies of the candidates should be the only factors which influence one\u0027s vote.

It continues to drive other false rumors about Mr. Obama’s background.\n\nJust last Friday, a woman told Senator John McCain at a town-hall-style meeting, “I have read about him,” and “he’s an Arab.” Mr. McCain corrected her.\n\nUntil this month, the man who is widely credited with starting the cyberwhisper campaign that still dogs Mr. Obama was a secondary character in news reports, with deep explorations of his background largely confined to liberal blogs.\n\nBut an appearance in a documentary-style program on the Fox News Channel watched by three million people last week thrust the man, Andy Martin, and his past into the foreground. The program allowed Mr. Martin to assert falsely and without challenge that Mr. Obama had once trained to overthrow the government.\n\nAn examination of legal documents and election filings, along with interviews with his acquaintances, revealed Mr. Martin, 62, to be a man with a history of scintillating if not always factual claims. He has left a trail of animosity — some of it provoked by anti-Jewish comments — among political leaders, lawyers and judges in three states over more than 30 years.\n\nHe is a law school graduate, but his admission to the Illinois bar was blocked in the 1970s after a psychiatric finding of “moderately severe character defect manifested by well-documented ideation with a paranoid flavor and a grandiose character.”\n\nThough he is not a lawyer, Mr. Martin went on to become a prodigious filer of lawsuits, and he made unsuccessful attempts to win public office for both parties in three states, as well as for president at least twice, in 1988 and 2000. Based in Chicago, he now identifies himself as a writer who focuses on his anti-Obama Web site and press releases.\n\nMr. Martin, in a series of interviews, did not dispute his influence in Obama rumors.\n\n“Everybody uses my research as a takeoff point,” Mr. Martin said, adding, however, that some take his writings “and exaggerate them to suit their own fantasies.”\n\nAs for his background, he said: “I’m a colorful person. There’s always somebody who has a legitimate cause in their mind to be angry with me.”\n\nWhen questions were raised last week about Mr. Martin’s appearance and claims on “Hannity’s America” on Fox News, the program’s producer said Mr. Martin was clearly expressing his opinion and not necessarily fact.\n\nIt was not Mr. Martin\u0027s first turn on national television. The CBS News program \"48 Hours\" in 1993 devoted an hourlong program, \"See You in Court; Civil War, Anthony Martin Clogs Legal System with Frivolous Lawsuits,\" to what it called his prolific filings. (Mr. Martin has also be known as Anthony Martin-Trigona.) He has filed so many lawsuits that a judge barred him from doing so in any federal court without preliminary approval.\n\nHe prepared to run as a Democrat for Congress in Connecticut, where paperwork for one of his campaign committees listed as one purpose “to exterminate Jew power.” He ran as a Republican for the Florida State Senate and the United States Senate in Illinois. When running for president in 1999, he aired a television advertisement in New Hampshire that accused George W. Bush of using cocaine.\n\nIn the 1990s, Mr. Martin was jailed in a case in Florida involving a physical altercation.\n\nHis newfound prominence, and the persistence of his line of political attack — updated regularly on his Web site and through press releases — amazes those from his past.\n\n“Well, that’s just a bookend for me,” said Tom Slade, a former chairman of the Florida Republican Party, whom Mr. Martin sued for refusing to support him. Mr. Slade said Mr. Martin was driven like “a run-over dog, but he’s fearless.”\n\nGiven Mr. Obama’s unusual background, which was the focus of his first book, it was perhaps bound to become fodder for some opposed to his candidacy.\n\nMr. Obama was raised mostly by his white mother, an atheist, and his grandparents, who were Protestant, in Hawaii. He hardly knew his father, a Kenyan from a Muslim family who variously considered himself atheist or agnostic, Mr. Obama wrote. For a few childhood years, Mr. Obama lived in Indonesia with a stepfather he described as loosely following a liberal Islam.\n\nTheories about Mr. Obama’s background have taken on a life of their own. But independent analysts seeking the origins of the cyberspace attacks wind up at Mr. Martin’s first press release, posted on the Free Republic Web site in August 2004.\n\nIts general outlines have turned up in a host of works that have expounded falsely on Mr. Obama’s heritage or supposed attempts to conceal it, including “Obama Nation,” the widely discredited best seller about Mr. Obama by Jerome R. Corsi. Mr. Corsi opens the book with a quote from Mr. Martin.\n\n“What he’s generating gets picked up in other places,” said Danielle Allen, a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University who has investigated the e-mail campaign’s circulation and origins, “and it’s an example of how the Internet has given power to sources we would have never taken seriously at another point in time.”\n\nMs. Allen said Mr. Martin’s original work found amplification in 2006, when a man named Ted Sampley wrote an article painting Mr. Obama as a secret practitioner of Islam. Quoting liberally from Mr. Martin, the article circulated on the Internet, and its contents eventually found their way into various e-mail messages, particularly an added claim that Mr. Obama had attended “Jakarta’s Muslim Wahhabi schools. Wahhabism is the radical teaching that created the Muslim terrorists who are now waging jihad on the rest of the world.”\n\nMr. Obama for two years attended a Catholic school in Indonesia, where he was taught about the Bible, he wrote in “Dreams From My Father,” and for two years went to an Indonesian public school open to all religions, where he was taught about the Koran.\n\nMr. Sampley, coincidentally, is a Vietnam veteran and longtime opponent of Mr. McCain and Senator John Kerry, both of whom he accused of ignoring his claims that American prisoners were left behind in Vietnam. He previously portrayed Mr. McCain as a “Manchurian candidate.” Speaking of Mr. Martin’s influence on his Obama writings, Mr. Sampley said, “I keyed off of his work.”\n\nMr. Martin’s depictions of Mr. Obama as a secret Muslim have found resonance among some Jewish voters who have received e-mail messages containing various versions of his initial theory, often by new authors and with new twists.\n\nIn his original press release, Mr. Martin wrote that he was personally “a strong supporter of the Muslim community.” But, he wrote of Mr. Obama, “it may well be that his concealment is meant to endanger Israel.” He added, “His Muslim religion would obviously raise serious questions in many Jewish circles.”\n\nYet in various court papers, Mr. Martin had impugned Jews.\n\nA motion he filed in a 1983 bankruptcy case called the judge “a crooked, slimy Jew who has a history of lying and thieving common to members of his race.”\n\nIn another motion, filed in 1983, Mr. Martin wrote, “I am able to understand how the Holocaust took place, and with every passing day feel less and less sorry that it did.”\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Martin denied some statements against Jews attributed to him in court papers, blaming malicious judges for inserting them.\n\nBut in his “48 Hours” interview in 1993, he affirmed a different anti-Semitic part of the affidavit that included the line about the Holocaust, saying, “The record speaks for itself.”\n\nWhen asked Friday about an assertion in his court papers that “Jews, historically and in daily living, act through clans and in wolf pack syndrome,” he said, “That one sort of rings a bell.”\n\nHe said he was not anti-Semitic. “I was trying to show that everybody in the bankruptcy court was Jewish and I was not Jewish,” he said, “and I was being victimized by religious bias.”\n\nIn discussing the denial of his admission to the Illinois bar, Mr. Martin said the psychiatric exam listing him as having a “moderately severe personality defect” was spitefully written by an evaluator he had clashed with.\n\nMr. Martin, who says he is from a well-off banking and farming family, is clearly pleased with his newfound attention. But, he said, others have added to his work in “scary” ways.\n\n“They Google ‘Islam’ and ‘Obama’ and my stuff comes up and they take that and kind of use that — like a Christmas tree, and they decorate it,” he said. For instance, he said, he did not necessarily ascribe to a widely circulated e-mail message from the Israeli right-wing activist Ruth Matar, which includes the false assertion, “If Obama were elected, he would be the first Arab-American president.”\n\nHe said he had at least come to “accept” Mr. Obama’s word that he had found Jesus Christ. His intent, he said, was only to educate.\n\nKitty Bennett contributed reporting.\n\nCopyright 2008 The New York Times Company"],"mavmankop":["Ah the classic \"you\u0027re the real racist\" "],"bobnoxious211":["WELL!

Someone who can\u0027t even come out in the open about his supposed religious affiliation will hardly be organizing suicide bombings in the name of Islam nor will be justify those who do. You can bring up these statistics to contend that Muslims are more likely to be violent or that they are bad people, but that does not actually prove causation: Islam --\u0026gt; violence, rather, it could be correlation (read *could*). It could be that these people are brought up in extremist cultures that also happen to be Muslim and will use whatever religious justification to enact hatred and violence.

But to say Obama is a Muslim, Muslims are found to be more extreme than other religions, therefore Obama condones violence in the name is his religion, that is the point I am trying to make, which goes along with what I originally was trying to say and that is it\u0027s sad that people not only want to assign a religion to the president which he does not subscribe to, but it is just as sad that it\u0027s considered ok to assign negative connotations to him because of this supposed religious affiliation.

I\u0027m personally all for assault weapons bans, for instance.\n\nEDIT: That\u0027s right, libertarian hive-mind...vote down anyone that disagrees with you even when they are trying to engage in intelligent debate.","Assault rifles typically:\n\n* have larger clips that hold more ammunition\n\n* have rounds capable of piercing police body-armor (yes, so do deer rifles, but deer rifles are a little less useful when trying to take down a line of police officers than an AR-15)\n\nI get that the average, uneducated person thinks that assault-weapon \u003d automatic weapon. I also get that uneducated people think that automatic weapons are already illegal - Mitt Romney said it during the 3rd debate, for instance. I further get that the use of the term \"assault weapon\" is purposely misused for political reasons. To say that it\u0027s a bullshit term, implying that they shouldn\u0027t be treated any differently than any other weapons is itself bullshit, though. They are definitely more dangerous in a mass shooting situation like the Aurora shootings or the attack on Gabrielle Giffords and they are also definitely more dangerous to police, which is why pro-gun people like myself support their ban.\n\nEDIT: I realize that this is Reddit karma suicide, since the prevailing social/political opinions on Reddit tend to turn toward survivalist, own as many badass guns as possible libertarianism. Enh.","Those are good points, though I\u0027d disagree that having a larger magazine doesn\u0027t make it more dangerous. Aside from the shotgun, the other weapons the Aurora shooter used were both high capacity weapons.\n\nAnd a .223 round can easily pierce armor. It\u0027s more about the grain than the caliber, which in the case of AR-15 is going to be pretty high most of the time (though not always). The reason that .223 rifles are sometimes banned for hunting is because they go through the animal without causing immediately lethal damage, causing the animal to then flee and possibly go off and die without being used by the hunter. This is a pretty different situation from a mass shooting spree.\n\nLet\u0027s be hypothetical. In the case of the Aurora shooting, what if the shooter had had a shotgun, a bolt-action 30.06 with a 6 round clip, and a .357 with a 6 round clip. Would he have been as deadly as he was in real life? I don\u0027t know...maybe, but it seems unlikely to me. ","\u0026gt;it malfunctioned after less than 30 rounds, which is the typical capacity of a normal magazine.\n\nIt\u0027s the typical capacity of a normal magazine for an assault weapon. If he had been armed with an average handgun or hunting rifle, it would be more like 6-10. That was my point.\n\n\u0026gt;In your hypothetical scenario, no he wouldn\u0027t have killed/injured as many people. But this is kind of besides the point since even under the old AWB he would have access to pretty much the exact same load out he actually did use. If you are using the example to advocate an even more extreme AWB, well, that\u0027s a whole new can of worms.\n\nThat is precisely what I was advocating yes, so I\u0027d say it\u0027s not beside the point. I never said that I support current AWB legislation - I said I support a ban on assault weapons. A ban, not a half-measure by liberal politicians to appease their base.\n\n\u0026gt;It just comes down to what you fundamentally believe. I didn\u0027t support the Patriot Act in reaction to 9/11, and I don\u0027t support assault weapon bans in reaction to shootings. I just don\u0027t like limiting the liberties that all normal law-abiding citizens enjoy just because of an isolated tragedy.\n\nI don\u0027t support limiting liberties in *reaction* to shootings, but in order to prevent them in the future. I also don\u0027t consider \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed\" to mean \"People can own as many and whatever kind of guns they want.\" It specifically says that the purpose to our right to bear arms is for maintaining a militia. State militias are no longer necessary (unless you mean the national guard, in which case their guns are supplied by the government), so the right to bear arms is not relevant. I\u0027m not personally for outlawing all guns because it\u0027s not practical and because they are fun and useful. But I don\u0027t think the 2nd Amendment any longer actually gives us that right and it certainly shouldn\u0027t be a catch-all to own your own military-grade arsenal just because you can.\n\nEDIT: But you make a very good argument. Upvotes for you, most definitely.\n\nEDIT2: Just in case anyone is wondering, I currently own and am very proficient with the following:\n\n* 1 .357 handgun, long-barrel\n\n* 2 30.06 deer rifles, bolt-action, scoped\n\n* 1 32.30, lever-action\n\n* 1 12 gauge shotgun, break action\n\n* 1 20 gauge shotgun, break action\n\nI also owned 4-10 shotguns in single and double barrel and a .22 rifle, but they were stolen while I was in college.\n\nSo, I\u0027m not against guns in general. I just 1) am against military-grade guns being legal, 2) don\u0027t think the 2nd Amendment is actually a valid defense of gun-ownership in the 21st century. I would say that gun-ownership is an implied right that is not guaranteed.","Damn...yes, thanks.","Lectured on this to my dual credit U.S. history class just the other day.

S. presidential candidate, Barack Hussein Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, to Barack Hussein Obama, Sr., a black MUSLIM from Nyangoma-Kogel, Kenya and Ann Dunham, a white ATHIEST from Wichita, Kansas. Obama\u0027s parents met at the University of Hawaii. When Obama was two years old, his parents divorced. His father returned to Kenya. His mother then married Lolo Soetoro, a RADICAL Muslim from Indonesia ?\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;When Obama was 6 years old, the family relocated to Indonesia. Obama attended a MUSLIM school in Jakarta. He also spent two years in a Catholic school. Obama takes great care to conceal the fact that he is a Muslim. He is quick to point out that, \u0027He was once a Muslim, but that he also attended Catholic school.\u0027 Obama\u0027s political handlers are attempting to make it appear that he is not a radical. Obama\u0027s introduction to Islam came via his father, and that influence was temporary at best. In reality, the senior Obama returned to Kenya soon after the divorce, and never again had any direct influence over his son\u0027s education. Lolo Soetoro, the second husband of Obama\u0027s mother, Ann Dunham, introduced his stepson to Islam. Obama was enrolled in a Wahabi school in Jakarta. Wahabism is the RADICAL teaching that is followed by the Muslim terrorists who are now waging Jihad against the western world. Since it is politically expedient to be a CHRISTIAN when seeking major public office in the United States, Barack Hussein Obama has joined the United Church of Christ in an attempt to downplay his Muslim background. ALSO, keep in mind that when he was sworn into office he DID NOT use the Holy Bible, but instead the Koran.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;Barack Hussein Obama will NOT recite the Pledge of Allegience nor will he show any reverence for our flag. While others place their hands over their hearts, Obama turns his back to the flag and slouches.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;Let us all remain alert concerning Obama\u0027s expected presidential candidacy. The Muslims have said they plan on destroying the U.S. from the inside out, what better way to start than at the highest level through the President of the United States, one of their own!!!!

Tarpley\n5-19-8\nhttp://www.rense.com/general82/obm.htm\n\nWASHINGTON, DC -- In my book Obama The Postmodern Coup: The Making of a Manchurian Candidate, I argue that presidential candidate Barack Obama is a wholly owned puppet of Zbigniew Brzezinski and his associates of the Trilateral Commission, founded by David Rockefeller. As some have noted, Brzezinski has been attempting to conceal his actual domination of the Obama campaign, for which he is the chief guru and controller. Now a rhetorical outburst by Obama on the campaign trail in Oregon has once again pointed to the reality that Obama is a ventriloquist\u0027s dummy, with the Russia-hating fanatic Brzezinski, a barbarous relic of the Cold War, acting as the ventriloquist.\n\nAt a recent campaign stop in Oregon, Obama stated:\n\"We can\u0027t drive our SUVs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect that other countries are going to say OK,\" Obama said. \"That\u0027s not leadership. That\u0027s not going to happen,\" he added. If India and China\u0027s \"carbon footprint gets as big as ours, we\u0027re gone.\" (AFP)\n\nThis remarkable statement reveals the true program of a future Obama administration: savage austerity, brutal economic sacrifice, and a massive further reduction in the standard of living of the depleted and exhausted US population as demanded by David Rockefeller, George Soros, and Obama\u0027s Wall Street backers. This will be done under left cover through a global warming tax, a third world solidarity tax, and other demagogic frauds, with the revenue going to bail out Goldman Sachs, Citibank, and JP Morgan Chase.

There are hundreds of millions of them.  If hate/violence/etc. was a core message of Islam, you\u0027d think that more than just a handful of extremists would have picked up the message.  There\u0027s the same level of the stuff in the Koran as in the Bible.\n\n\u0026gt; Why not? Ever thought about it?\n\nMany reasons.  What\u0027s your theory?  We didn\u0027t see it in Asia either, are you going to say the same things about Buddhism and Hinduism.\n\n\u0026gt; I agree. But religion, sadly, is an important part of the whole picture. Why so? Because religious identity, sadly, is a very important kind of identity, still, for a lot of people.\n\nOf course it is, that\u0027s not under dispute.  Their religion motivates them to kill, but what religion wouldn\u0027t do the same to a crazy person?  Christianity sure as hell does it every once in a while.  If there was something inherently violent in Islam\u0027s message you\u0027d expect crazies from all Muslim countries equally.\n\nYet they all come from a very specific sub-region of where Muslims live.  Hmm\n\n\u0026gt; Let\u0027s wait. Turkey is in the middle of Islamization. Besides, Turkey\u0027s recent rulers have been militantly secularistic. You can\u0027t give Turkey 100% credit for secularism that was not of their free will. It\u0027s like giving USSR citizens credit for being atheistic at a time when atheism was a government mandate in USSR. That\u0027s crooked thinking.\n\nHey, in the end there aren\u0027t any Turkish suicide bombers.  What about indonesian?  All those other countries I mentioned?  How come they all come from a very specific part of the world?  If it was a muslim thing you\u0027d expect them from all corners of the Muslim world -yet they don\u0027t.\n\n\u0026gt; West\n\nYeah, secular, right?  Yet all those countries I mentioned have large Muslim populations.  If there was an inherently violent message in Islam you\u0027d expect extremists to be a fairly regular occurance in all those places (Canada, Sweden, Germany)\n\n\u0026gt; Extremism in the form of militancy is one of the problems. But there are other problems. Islamic attitude toward women. Islamic attitude toward dogs and liquor. Islamic ideas about punishment (very brutal and cruel). Islamic attitude toward non-Muslims. Islamic attitude toward apostasy.\n\nI know some muslims who live in Canada who don\u0027t hold any of those attitudes...  yet they\u0027re Muslim.  How is that possible?\n\n\u0026gt; In other words, even in a Muslim society where people don\u0027t strap the suicide vests on, you can often see the negative influence of Islam. And the more Muslims in one place the worse it usually goes. Muslims are at their best when they are very dispersed in low numbers across the West. But get a bunch of them together, especially in the Middle East, Africa or India, and bad shit happens. Militarism is just one bad dimension of Islam. That\u0027s the jihad dimension. But Islam has plenty of bad dimensions besides militarism.\n\nOh boy..  I do think that religion overall is a bad influence on people, so I can\u0027t not disagree with you there, but you make it sound like all Muslims are extremist nutcases.  Maybe you need to go out and meet some nice and pleasant moderate Muslims?\n\n\u0026gt; I don\u0027t want to sit here and pretend Islamic doctrine is acceptable when it isn\u0027t. I don\u0027t want to slaughter every Muslim or anything like that. In fact I want the wars to end as much as possible. However, I also think we need to speak out about Islam. We\u0027ve got to criticize it.\n\nThe Abrahamic religions do need to be criticized and I\u0027ll be one of the first to jump in...  but I wouldn\u0027t lump all Muslims together and say that they\u0027re all crazy extremists due to their religion.  That\u0027s a bit insulting..  not to mention not true.\n\nInterpretation of religion is a fundamental thing at play here.  You can interpret an old and outdated religious text hatefully, like extremists do..  or you can interpret it in a moderate way, like most Muslims do.\n\nIf the Koran is such an evil document that\u0027s inherently violent enough to cause all the problems we are seeing with Islam, then you can\u0027t really not say the same thing about the Bible - which might even contain more crazy bullshit than the Koran does.  \n\nTwo old religious texts, both filled with violent and crazy bullshit..  Two groups of people, one generally a lot more moderate than the other..  A whole bunch of extremists, mostly from a very specific part of the world.\n\nIf religion was all there was to it, you\u0027d see an equal number of extremists per capita all over the globe.  You don\u0027t.  They all come from a very specific place.   You should be directing your research there and trying to figure out why that is.\n\nedit: downvoted by God"],"yoda17":["Wow, where do you work (without being specific)?","If he really wanted to have some fun, he\u0027d put on a blue turban and claim the US for Al Qaeda.I guess that\u0027s why I\u0027m not president."],"rheezie":["O, I don\u0027t know...maybe his name!!!

The media does very little in mentioning the Christian nations in the Middle-East (I have a few Armenian friends who are all devout Christians, even though I\u0027m atheist, and they always like to point out that fact that not *all* Middle-Eastern countries are Muslim). \n\nSomewhere in this 9-year timeline, Al Qaeda \u003d Terrorist \u003d Muslim \u003d Terrorist. Likely though the unsuccessful (or successful) attempts of terrorist attacks throughout the world by those who practice the Islamic faith, the media just changed its vernacular and decided that being Muslim was just as good as being a terrorist. And, let\u0027s be honest, American television - be it infotainment, entertainment, legitimate journalism, or otherwise - is often more *entertainment* than anything else. Thus, we have mass hysteria, and Glenn Beck, and Sarah Palin being actual sources of misinformed information for some Americans. \n\nI also think that many people (especially those who are ill-informed, uneducated, or just plain bigots) hear/see a *name* and believe it is of terrorist, or, FSM forbid, Muslim origin.

Being a Mormon myself, we use the King James Bible as a supplemental text to the Book of Mormon, which is the primary text of our beliefs. ","To be honest with you, I\u0027m not quite sure. Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism, grew up during the 2nd Great Awakening in the \u0027burned over district\u0027 of New York. He was surrounded by evangelical religions that used the KJV, so my guess is that the KGV is the only version of the Bible that was available to Joseph Smith and other early restored Church members. But that\u0027s just my guess, I don\u0027t really know.","I would also like to point out that, despite being founded during the 2nd Great Awakening, Mormonism is not a Protestant/Evangelical religion.","There are a few things I would like to clear up in this thread.\n\nFirstly, I\u0027m just going to put it out there that I am a Mormon. I\u0027m not here to preach or proselyte, I\u0027m here to debunk some of the misconceptions about Mormonism floating around in this thread. \n\nAll that aside, I would like to first point out that the name \u0027Mormon\u0027 isn\u0027t exactly correct; it\u0027s a nickname. The real name of my church is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I suspect the misnomer of \u0027Mormon\u0027 came as a slang term derived from our primary text, The Book of Mormon. Since it\u0027s kind of a mouthful to say, \"he/she\u0027s a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,\" I imagine people decided to call us Mormons because it\u0027s simple and is easy to associate that name with our beliefs. Whatever the reason, the name stuck. \n\nWith that misconception out of the way, it should be quite evident from seeing the real title of my church that us Mormons are, in fact, Christians. Our primary text, The Book of Mormon, is actually called The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. If you read The Book of Mormon, you should quickly realize that us Mormons are Christians. We believe in Jesus Christ, and we try to follow his example as best we can. \n\nUs Mormons are also not polygamists. It is true that we practiced polygamy in our history, but we ended that practice over a century ago. Mormon marriages are strictly monogamous. \n\nI apologize if this post is too unrelated to the OP, but I feel that some of these misconceptions need to be cleared up, in order to have a well-informed discussion about Romney\u0027s faith. \n\nIf you have any criticisms about me or my faith, I ask that you keep it civil. I am here for intelligent, civil discussion, not an ideological flamewar. \n\nEdit 1: Grammar corrections.","And yes, there is plenty of Mormon hatred going around in political forums, and I think it\u0027s mostly become an issue for debate because Mitt is a Mormon.","You say this like you want to see some hatred of Mormonism.

Well, of course, all distances *can* be expressed in millimeters.  The distance from the Earth to the Sun is about 150,000,000,000,000 millimeters.  However, millimeters aren\u0027t the most convenient unit to use here, which is the real point:  \"it can be expressed in millimeters\" is shorthand (and perhaps idiomatic) for \"it is convenient to express in millimeters\".\n\nIt\u0027s the same with \"less than one percent\".  In mathematical terms, it\u0027s a bare inequality.  In human language, it means that it\u0027s not only true that it\u0027s less than one percent, but it also means that that\u0027s the strongest statement that is convenient to make considering the information available and considering how concise you need to be.  The implicit assumption is that *if you could just as easily have made a stronger statement, you would have*.\n\nFor another example, consider the statement, \"I\u0027m hungry.\"  A mathematically equivalent statement is, \"I\u0027m hungry, and the sky is blue.\"  However, when it comes to human communication, these two statements are not equivalent.  If you said the former to a friend, they might ask, \"Want to grab some lunch?\".  But if you said the latter to a friend, they might resopnd, \"Huh?  What does that mean?\".  They know you\u0027re getting at something, but they don\u0027t know what.  Because human communication is made in a context, and what you choose to include and choose to leave out is important.  The assumption is that if there weren\u0027t something significant in your statement, you wouldn\u0027t be going to the trouble of making that statement.  Therefore, more or less, every part of that statement is there for a reason.","\u0026gt; Obama is the son of a Muslim\n\nNitpick:  Isn\u0027t he the son of a man *who was raised as a Muslim*?

As I understand it, as an adult, Obama\u0027s father was an atheist or agnostic.\n\nSnopes seem to [basically agree](http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/muslim.asp).

Also, if you look at [the history](http://christopedia.us/w/index.php?title\u003dBarack_Hussein_Obama\u0026amp;action\u003dhistory), you can see that [someone named **XenonII**](http://christopedia.us/wiki/User:XenonII) had done tons and tons of edits, and then some [user named **Bhs**](http://christopedia.us/wiki/User:Bhs) came along and did only the last two edits, which were the ones that introduced the \"n\" word.\n\nNote that older, non-vandalized version is still pretty bad.  I think the vandal was just trying to parody it by carrying it further in the direction it was already going.","According to http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/muslim.asp , which in turn is quoting Barack:\n\n\u0026gt; For my mother, organized religion too often dressed up closed-mindedness in the garb of piety, cruelty and oppression in the cloak of righteousness.  This isn\u0027t to say that she provided me with no religious instruction. In her mind, a working knowledge of the world\u0027s great religions was a necessary part of any well-rounded education. In our household the Bible, the Koran, and the Bhagavad Gita sat on the shelf alongside books of Greek and Norse and African mythology. On Easter or Christmas Day my mother might drag me to church, just as she dragged me to the Buddhist temple, the chinese New Year celebration, the Shinto shrine, and ancient Hawaiian burial sites. But I was made to understand that such religious samplings required no sustained commitment on my part. Religion was an expression of human culture, she would explain, not its wellspring, just one of the many ways — and not necessarily the best way — that man attempted to control the unknowable and understand the deeper truths about our lives.\n\nSo I would say Barack was brought up with the sampler platter of religion.","\u0026gt; Islam is very different from Christianity. We don\u0027t have lapsed Muslims like the Catholics do. Your either a practicing believing Muslim or your not a Muslim.\n\nChristianity varies a lot, but there are some Christian denominations that believe approximately the same thing.  The book of James has [a famous section](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search\u003dJames+2:14-20\u0026amp;version\u003d49) about how faith without works is \"dead\" and \"useless\".  Different groups interpret this differently.  Some subscribe to the idea of \"once saved, always saved\", which basically says that becoming a Christian is a one-time decision that you cannot reverse, and if you fall away, it\u0027s obviously very bad but it doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027re not a Christian anymore.  Other groups say that you can \"lose your salvation\" if you fall away.","\u0026gt; Or maybe he\u0027s secretly a Baptist.\n\nNo kidding, when I was a teenager, in about 1985, the youth group at my Baptist church wanted to organize a dance.  We talked to the youth minister about the idea, and he talked to the church leaders about it, but the verdict came back that even though he thought there was nothing wrong with it, we\u0027d probably offend some of the older members of the church.  So no deal, we couldn\u0027t have a dance.  The idea of doing a square dance (instead of one with pop/rock music) was put forward, but that wasn\u0027t thought to be different enough to matter.\n\nSo in case anyone was wondering, there was a time, not all that long ago, when this whole \"we\u0027re Baptists, we can\u0027t dance\" thing was for real.\n\nOh, and I suck at dancing now.  My little joke of an excuse is always, \"Well, I was raised as a Baptist.\"","\u0026gt; Conservepedia uses the abbreviation CP to describe itself\n\nI\u0027m not getting the reference.

In other words, because generally only old people and the morbidly unoccupied bother to give their opinions to a stranger over the phone (the rest of us have kids/friends/jobs/better things to do), they straight up INVENT responses/respondents that did not exist in real life to generate their end product.\n\nI don\u0027t think this kind of weighting works, I think polling agencies know this and therefore refuse to release this part of their methodology, and in my experience response bias is the most confounding obstacle facing phonebank polling.

I can\u0027t for the life of me think of ONE thing they allegedly stand for that I\u0027ve heard them make a rational argument for.","Ad hominem attacks are unproductive, I agree.  However, I think there\u0027s more than enough (admittedly somewhat circumstantial) evidence that the overall march of the far right is discriminatory in nature toward women and minorities.  Witness the recent birth control nonsense, the so-called \"personhood\" bills in several southern states, the hardline stance against gay rights, the completely unwarranted restrictions on voting rights, etc.  Additionally, look at the HUGE increase in anti-government armed militia hate groups over the last 3 years.  To me (at the very least) it\u0027s no coincidence that the number of hard line right wing militias have ballooned in the years since the nation\u0027s first black president took office.  Imagine if *just a handful* of minority groups (or even ONE) formed armed militias... it would be the national crisis du jour for Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, and Glenn Beck.\n\nI sincerely mean no offense, but the \"low tax, small government, and personal responsibility\" mantra fits the mold of right wing \"talking points\" perfectly.  I don\u0027t mean to be demeaning when I say that, rather I am trying to illustrate that it could be found in virtually every Fox News pundit clip for the last 3½ years.\n\nThe tax thing is a huge difference you and I have - or maybe a huge similarity, although I doubt it.  The wealthiest Americans are taxed at the lowest rate since the 1950s and under the plan of the leading GOP candidate they would actually see a tax reduction while the rest of America would see a tax increase.  This is to say nothing of what this would add to the deficit.\n\nFrankly the deficit is, to me, way overblown.  Is it a serious issue?  Sure.  Is a \"sky is falling\" impending disaster?  No.  We are nowhere near as bad off debt wise as Europe (save Germany perhaps), for example.  Certainly our national debt is something to be dealt with, no question, but there are better ways to deal with it than tax cuts and more pressing issues.\n\nThe phrase \"personal responsibilty\" began surfacing in very high usage in early 2009.  It was one of the many phrases from the rhetoric mill that is Frank Luntz.  As for small government, where were the right wing intelligentsia back when the vaunted Ronald Reagan was doubling the size of government?  Why won\u0027t the right wing do anything about out of control military spending?¹\n\nI do understand *some* of the appeal of the right wing...\n\nI am 48 years old.  My first vote in a national election was for Ronald Reagan in 1984 (I was a tad too young in 1980), but it was based on the ignorance of voting the way my family did.  My grandfather was a local GOP elected official in NC for decades, my parents voted Republican (surprising, given the fact that my father and mother were both anti-war college teachers in the 1970s), my wife is still a registered Republican (although she hasn\u0027t voted for a GOP presidential candidate since Bush I back in 1988 or \u002792).  Before I started understanding the political big picture, and started seeking news sources outside the mainstream, I fell right in line with the family tradition.  The last decade and a half have been nothing short of ~~incredible~~ INSANE in terms of how far off the deep end the GOP has gone.  Perhaps most amazing about the whole thing is the way the right wing masses gravitate toward pundits like Beck and Limbaugh, without questioning for a second the validity of their words.\n\nI didn\u0027t mean to get off on a \"bash the right\" rant... I really didn\u0027t.  But I sometimes get a little passionate in my replies.\n\nAnyway, thanks for answering my sincere question.\n\n___  \n\n¹  Ron Paul is the only right wing candidate to offer a plan that won\u0027t increase the debt, but it comes at an enormous cost to programs benefitting the poor.  On top of that, for all of Paul\u0027s anti-war rhetoric about bringing troops home from our foreign wars (something I agree with), he has no plan for them once they\u0027re back.  This leads me to believe he would be quite happy to have them homeless and not getting the *government paid* care they so desperately need (and will need for years to come).","Is \"retarda\" the collective noun and they\u0027re just inbreeding like rabbits?"],"sidewalkchalked":["Notice how McCain says, no no he\u0027s not Muslim he\u0027s a decent man.\n\nImagine someone saying, no don\u0027t worry he\u0027s not a Jew, he\u0027s okay."],"siahsargus":["Ahem...\n\nVIII/X\n\nDon\u0027t let them arabs win."],"flying_wreckage":["Seriously.

A list of weapons with features that have little to do with lethality are all suddenly illegal?  Imo it\u0027s the equivalent of saying that all Honda Civics with spoilers and hood scoops are now illegal because they look dangerous.  \n\nThe term \"assault weapons\" is used to mislead people into thinking the ban would be on automatic weapons, which is actually not the case at all since automatic weapons are already heavily regulated(as they should be).  The fact is that an \"assault weapon\" is no more dangerous than the hunting rifle or shotgun many families have in their closet.\n\nOn top of that, \"assault weapons\" make up only a tiny percent of all weapons in the US, and are only used in about 1% of ALL gun related crimes anyway.\n\nIf we really want to crack down on gun violence, I advocate more gun education.  I want people to be much more aware of gun safety, the importance of knowing how to prevent negligent discharges, and the need to fucking lock up your weapons so we have less stolen guns on the street.  Just imo here but I think this is not too unlike teaching safe sex rather than abstinence.","First off it\u0027s magazine, not clip; but it\u0027s a non factor because the size of the magazine has nothing to do with weather or not it is classified as an assault weapon.  \n\nAlso almost any rifle cartridge will pierce police body armor, minus the plate inserts if they are wearing them.  They are generally only rated to stop smaller calibers.  Infact, the AR-15 typically is chambered in .223, which is less powerful than most rounds used for hunting; it is actually illegal to hunt with .223 in a lot of places because it isn\u0027t effective in killing game animals.  \n\nThe fact is, firearms classified as \"assault weapons\" are generally NOT more dangerous than most other guns.  Take the Aurora shooting for example, he used an AR-15, a shotgun, and a glock.  All three of these weapons have AWB-friendly versions.  The only difference would have been the ergonomics on the AR, potentially 3 less rounds in the shotgun, and the glock would have been the same.  All three of these weapons are also insanely popular with law abiding citizens.  The Tuscon shooter also used a AWB-legal weapon, the glock 19.\n\nNow there is an argument against large capacity magazines, because really who the fuck needs 50+ rounds?  But honestly it doesn\u0027t really make the weapon more effective.  The larger magazines always have a problem with proper feeding and are incredibly likely to cause malfunctions, which will take up more time than simply performing a magazine change.  There\u0027s a reason professionals don\u0027t usually use them.","The Aurora shooting is actually a very good example of why a larger magazine is not as effective as having multiple average sized magazines.  Holmes opened fire with this AR-15 loaded with a 100-round drum magazine; it malfunctioned after less than 30 rounds, which is the typical capacity of a normal magazine.  If he had instead carried three or four 30 round magazines, he could have easily cleared his weapon and reloaded in under 5 seconds and continued firing rather than having to switch to his glock.\n\nIn your hypothetical scenario, no he wouldn\u0027t have killed/injured as many people.  But this is kind of besides the point since even under the old AWB he would have access to pretty much the exact same load out he actually did use.  If you are using the example to advocate an even more extreme AWB, well, that\u0027s a whole new can of worms.\n\nI think the fact is that crazy people are going to go crazy, even if guns were completely outlawed he could have tossed a home made explosive in the theater and probably gotten even more casualties.\n\nIt just comes down to what you fundamentally believe.  I didn\u0027t support the Patriot Act in reaction to 9/11, and I don\u0027t support assault weapon bans in reaction to shootings.

Let me toss out one of multiple arguments:\n\nI would rather cut short a life that hasn\u0027t begun living\\* than bring that life into a family that doesn\u0027t want it, won\u0027t properly care for it and likely abuse it.\n\nYou can talk about the option of adoption all you want, but far too many unwanted children stay with their birth parents and are raised in an environment rife with resentment, anger and abuse. No child should have to endure that, and such upbringings often produce unstable adults who are predisposed towards the same types of behaviors.\n\nAnd on a tangentially related note, suppose abortion is outlawed. How would you feel about government support programs to give financial aid to people burdened with children they cannot afford and would have chosen to abort if given that choice? Please avoid, for now, the subject of the abuse of the system. It\u0027s fairly common for pro-lifers to care ever so much about preserving a fetus but turn around and be staunchly against offering support once that fetus leaves the womb, and cries of drug addicts and welfare queens abusing the system are inevitably brought out as a justification-slash-deflection. I can respect if that\u0027s a concern, but I would like to see a well-reasoned argument that does not rely solely on that premise.\n\n\\* Let\u0027s skip the \"when life begins\" debate for now. Whatever the potential human experiences in the womb during the first trimester (that being the most common abortion window) is not qualitative life experience. Life, by some definitions may begin before birth, but such a life has not truly *lived*.\n\n\u0026gt;Supporting the vicious slaughter of babies just because they were conceived incorrectly is no different to supporting the elimination of an entire race, because said race is statistically likely to be unemployed or a criminal.\n\nHoly cunting Christ, no. Firstly, \"vicious\" is not an adjective applicable to modern abortions. They\u0027re not done in back alleys with coat hangers, for fuck\u0027s sake. Secondly, genocide destroys people who are already *people*. They\u0027re living, breathing, sentient beings with feelings and memories and knowledge. A fetus doesn\u0027t have those things. There is a non-trivial likelihood that any given fetus will die before it does. A fetus is nothing but potential. And yes, cutting loose that potential before it can manifest isn\u0027t great. Lost potential will always be tragic, but I consider the murder of an actual *person* to be a much greater crime.\n\nA fetus has no concept of it\u0027s own existence as an individual. It cannot understand life, much less the value of it\u0027s own life. What, then, is death to a fetus? Should we not feel more compassion for the lives that will experience terror and dread and loss and regret?\n\nDon\u0027t you dare compare the death of a fetus to an actual person. They are *incomparable*.","\u0026gt; Okay, so to avoid inconveniencing a slut who goes out and gets herself pregnant without being prepared for the consequences\n\nEven the most effective, responsible methods of birth control have failure rates, however infinitesimal. Even vasectomies can spontaneously reverse. People who use these methi Why punish those who made every effort to avoid being put in this situation? \n\n\u0026gt;you favor the killing of what is effectively a human being\n\nNo, I don\u0027t. I just spent a couple paragraphs explaining that I do not equate the life of a fetus to that of a grown human. Given the choice between the two (and assuming the grown human isn\u0027t a heinous criminal or otherwise horrible), I would choose to kill the fetus *every time*. The value of that \"life\" is, as I said above, *incomparable* to that of a grown (or growing!) human.\n\n\u0026gt;At what stage do you believe that life begins? the third trimester? Maybe the moment that the baby\u0027s head emerges from the womb? Or maybe it\u0027s not until the baby takes its\u0027 first steps?\n\nLife is a difficult term to define. The best metrics I\u0027ve seen for defining life are A) self-sustainability, the point at which it can survive outside the womb and B) the start of brain activity (chosen because death, or the lack of life, is defined as the cessation of brain activity).\n\nIn either case this brings us to a few weeks ranging from the end of the second trimester to the beginning of the third.\n\nInterestingly, Christianity traditionally defines life as beginning at the moment of ensoulment, which happens when the child first draws breath. And, again traditionally, they didn\u0027t consider a fetus a potential human until it\u0027s first movement was felt by the mother. Today\u0027s Christian pro-lifers have come a long way. \n\n\u0026gt;A three year old \"has no concept of it\u0027s own existence as an individual. It cannot understand life, much less the value of it\u0027s own life.\" So what is death to a three year old?\n\nFun fact, humans begin to understand their own existence as an individual around *two* years of age. That aside, what I said was that \"Should we not feel more compassion for the lives that will experience terror and dread and loss and regret?\"\n\nDeath to a three year old (who is aware of dying) will often include pain. There will also be fear, the desire for it\u0027s parents\u0027 comfort, possibly even betrayal, abandonment...the list can go on. Death to a cat or dog will include many of the same things, none of which a fetus is capable of experiencing.\n\nAnd finally, you neglected to address something from my previous post, so I\u0027ll restate it:\n\n\u0026gt;And on a tangentially related note, suppose abortion is outlawed.

One of them is Public Policy Polling (PPP), a polling firm that conducts automated polls for both public consumption and for liberal and Democratic clients.\n\n\u0026gt;Take a look at this exchange, for example, between The New York Times’ Nate Cohn and PPP’s Tom Jensen. Cohn discovered that in 2012, the racial composition of PPP’s polls was correlated in an unusual way with President Obama’s performance among white voters in their surveys. If Obama was performing especially poorly among whites in one PPP poll, it tended to have a higher share of nonwhite voters, which boosted Obama’s result. And if Obama was doing relatively well among whites, PPP projected less nonwhite turnout, keeping his lead in check. As a result, PPP’s polls tended to show an unusually steady race between Obama and Mitt Romney.\n\n\u0026gt;I’m picking on PPP for a reason: They’re the biggest herders in the business. Here’s the chart I showed you before, but with only PPP’s polls highlighted. On average, in states with at least three other recent polls, their polls deviated from the polling average by only 1.6 percentage points.
