Assuming the aircraft is already on an orderly heading and the autopilot systems are still working (somehow) then I can\u0027t see anything stopping it from just merrily flying on as a depressurised ghost until the fuel ran out and it ditched into the ocean.\n\nI accept that it\u0027s far fetched for some systems to fail and others to keep working after the aircraft has apparently been gutted by fire, but it shouldn\u0027t be ruled out.  The sudden and sharp turn does look a lot like an emergency procedure, and nobody has verified whether or not the aircraft really did sharply climb as people claim.","duration":"","id":53,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cotuzsv","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"I know that this has probably been posted on here before but I can\u0027t help but feel people are forgetting one of the most recent mysteries of our time, the disappearance of the MH-370 flight.","label":"illegitimatetimelord","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_2wga5u","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.424397552E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.424675645E9,"simScore":0.7503691203944636,"sentiment":"  Negative"}],"userNodes":[],"links":[{"source":1,"target":0,"weight":0.674611359462142},{"source":2,"target":1,"weight":0.7956833309183517},{"source":3,"target":1,"weight":0.7227785651172911},{"source":4,"target":3,"weight":0.7496354106281484},{"source":5,"target":4,"weight":0.818124994635582},{"source":6,"target":1,"weight":0.6356711484205264},{"source":7,"target":0,"weight":0.7682139846409718},{"source":8,"target":7,"weight":0.6525815867891911},{"source":9,"target":8,"weight":0.6893602619668853},{"source":10,"target":8,"weight":0.6121297277789988},{"source":11,"target":0,"weight":0.6817302446634996},{"source":12,"target":11,"weight":0.7372053542307445},{"source":13,"target":12,"weight":0.7581950762506687},{"source":14,"target":13,"weight":0.6078845579671462},{"source":15,"target":14,"weight":0.7286155852261008},{"source":16,"target":11,"weight":0.805767853611282},{"source":17,"target":0,"weight":0.8214025959953085},{"source":18,"target":0,"weight":0.7192980639993993},{"source":19,"target":18,"weight":0.8509672600973062},{"source":20,"target":19,"weight":0.8201528432532896},{"source":21,"target":0,"weight":0.5914386340840296},{"source":22,"target":0,"weight":0.7689488627524539},{"source":23,"target":0,"weight":0.7464380927588172},{"source":24,"target":0,"weight":0.6627113617787307},{"source":25,"target":0,"weight":0.7661775636191784},{"source":26,"target":0,"weight":0.775365226960226},{"source":27,"target":26,"weight":0.5452993389885805},{"source":28,"target":27,"weight":0.6134650555306559},{"source":29,"target":28,"weight":0.5620862682347951},{"source":30,"target":29,"weight":0.5808755791682234},{"source":31,"target":30,"weight":0.727990647220522},{"source":32,"target":31,"weight":0.7920333319654067},{"source":33,"target":26,"weight":0.6416553724349618},{"source":34,"target":33,"weight":0.6665227502354589},{"source":35,"target":34,"weight":0.6699743823988266},{"source":36,"target":26,"weight":0.40598641735612206},{"source":37,"target":26,"weight":0.6693892546630507},{"source":38,"target":26,"weight":0.6637265987584156},{"source":39,"target":38,"weight":0.7401140320271178},{"source":40,"target":39,"weight":0.8731976574798773},{"source":41,"target":39,"weight":0.7898117656552652},{"source":42,"target":41,"weight":0.70508332674702},{"source":43,"target":0,"weight":0.7417547254625596},{"source":44,"target":0,"weight":0.7579487019331392},{"source":45,"target":0,"weight":0.7263203437882241},{"source":46,"target":45,"weight":0.800372024672845},{"source":47,"target":0,"weight":0.7492753215023049},{"source":48,"target":47,"weight":0.7089238369374564},{"source":49,"target":48,"weight":0.7453555517726475},{"source":50,"target":47,"weight":0.8758961045896853},{"source":51,"target":50,"weight":0.8597499998552459},{"source":52,"target":0,"weight":0.7736195793340952},{"source":53,"target":0,"weight":0.7503691203944636}],"userLinks":[],"submissions":[{"user":{"username":"hellovn100","modhash":"44n7qs0jrz18037b0649bfa7d3ab6d1d55ac8076d1c3ee6ed2","cookie":"43916988,2015-11-22T19:13:24,cfe2fb7dfc0aa3073ff105a309eb720a615eaa0c","password":"111111"},"wikis":[],"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/2wga5u/i_know_that_this_has_probably_been_posted_on_here/","permalink":"/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/2wga5u/i_know_that_this_has_probably_been_posted_on_here/?ref\u003dsearch_posts","author":"illegitimatetimelord","title":"I know that this has probably been posted on here before but I can\u0027t help but feel people are forgetting one of the most recent mysteries of our time, the disappearance of the MH-370 flight.","subreddit":"UnresolvedMysteries","subredditId":"t5_2wvvc","thumbnail":"","selftext":"Like I said in the title this has probably been posted before but I wanted to bring it back up, just so people don\u0027t forget about it.
