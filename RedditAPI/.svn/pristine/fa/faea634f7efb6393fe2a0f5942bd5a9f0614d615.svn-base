| when it comes to central doctrinal writings and how they are usually interpreted.

This is the real key, everything else is bluster. However, I believe that if you read the two side by side, without the cloud of theocracy, you will find both to be reprehensible.
Evil is evil, is one more evil than the other. My guess would be it depends on interpretation. Jesus did not change anything from the old testament:

Matthew: 5:17-19
17 â€œDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. 18 For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. 19 Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

And what do you mean by "equally as bad". The old testament is pretty damn nasty. For instance, stoning a child that speaks back to his parents, that's pretty damn evil in my book. Whether or not it's "more" evil, I cannot say,  but I cannot see how this is any better than the other.

WTF .... are you even talking about.
I think you give yourself far too much credit, as I'm pretty sure the empirical evidence shows your are a dumbass.
You also have the worst school system, more teen pregnancy, and the lowest wages .... and I'm a Texan myself, there are two sides to every coin.
| our Universities are some of the tops in their fields

Unfortunately, they must be stocked from out-of-state, as the public education in Texas is crap and getting worse. As for the wages, I was just pointing out that the state of Texas has traditionally low wages(bottom third of the nation).
You are an idiot.
