The Jews say, \u0027Ezra (Ozair) is a son of God\u0027; and the Christians say, \u0027The Messiah is a son of God\u0027. Such the sayings in their mouths! They resemble the sayings of the Infidels of old! God do battle with them! How are they misguided!..He it is who hath sent His Apostle with the Guidance and a religion of the truth, that He may make it victorious over every other religion, albeit they who assign partners to God be averse from it.\" (Sura 9:29-33).\n\n\u0026gt;\"O Prophet! make war on the infidels and hypocrites, and deal rigorously with them. Hell shall be their abode! and wretched the passage to it!\" (Sura 66:9).\n\nIt\u0027s not that simple though.  \n\nOne of the issues we\u0027re dealing with is that there are different \"versions\" of the Quran, and it\u0027s not solidified, and the differing factions haven\u0027t drawn their lines in the sands as well.  \n\nLet\u0027s say we have the Christian bible, the Catholic bible and the John Smith Bible+Book of Mormon+all the other books the Mormon\u0027s have.  The Christians stopped at the bible, the Catholics added the Apocrypha, and the Mormon\u0027s changed the bible, and started adding books.  \n\nIn the same way we have differing muslim factions.  Some take only the peaceful parts, others add on \"Oh we get to kill people who won\u0027t join us\".  There are doctrines that say \"If a later writing contradicts a previous writing, the later writing takes precedent\", so there\u0027s that.  \n\nLets take the \"Jesus\" religions as an example.  They\u0027re really well factioned, and the differences are somewhat well defined (Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists, 7th day Adventists etc).   So lets say the 7th day Adventists added to their scriptures \"Anyone who doesn\u0027t join us, we totally get to kill\", and they start going to town.

The Jews say, \u0027Ezra (Ozair) is a son of God\u0027; and the Christians say, \u0027The Messiah is a son of God\u0027. Such the sayings in their mouths! They resemble the sayings of the Infidels of old! God do battle with them! How are they misguided!..He it is who hath sent His Apostle with the Guidance and a religion of the truth, that He may make it victorious over every other religion, albeit they who assign partners to God be averse from it.\" (Sura 9:29-33).\n\n\u0026gt;\"O Prophet! make war on the infidels and hypocrites, and deal rigorously with them. Hell shall be their abode! and wretched the passage to it!\" (Sura 66:9).\n\nIt\u0027s not that simple though.  \n\nOne of the issues we\u0027re dealing with is that there are different \"versions\" of the Quran, and it\u0027s not solidified, and the differing factions haven\u0027t drawn their lines in the sands as well.  \n\nLet\u0027s say we have the Christian bible, the Catholic bible and the John Smith Bible+Book of Mormon+all the other books the Mormon\u0027s have.  The Christians stopped at the bible, the Catholics added the Apocrypha, and the Mormon\u0027s changed the bible, and started adding books.  \n\nIn the same way we have differing muslim factions.  Some take only the peaceful parts, others add on \"Oh we get to kill people who won\u0027t join us\".  There are doctrines that say \"If a later writing contradicts a previous writing, the later writing takes precedent\", so there\u0027s that.  \n\nLets take the \"Jesus\" religions as an example.  They\u0027re really well factioned, and the differences are somewhat well defined (Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists, 7th day Adventists etc).

Seriously.  Internet is good for that.\n\n\u0026gt;Do you actively search for moderate Muslim opinions \n\nI mostly look at doctrinal writings, but I\u0027ve talked to Muslims a few times on reddit and offline.  I\u0027m not going to say they are all crazy lunatics, that\u0027s just false.  But plenty of times I talked to Muslims I walked away disappointed and sad.  They really don\u0027t say stuff I wish they would say.  And while I can see how they are aligning with the doctrine, in my mind I think, \"guys, don\u0027t you see how the doctrine is inadequate?\"  Of course once you become a true believer, and you accept that the doctrine is the word of the omniscient God, what chance is there to think critically about it?  So if you think I don\u0027t encounter this in a discussion with Muslims, you\u0027re wrong.\n\nAnyway, I don\u0027t really hate the individual Muslims, but I *am* concerned about the doctrine.  I worry that Muslims promote Islam without giving any thought to the impact the doctrine has on humanity.  I watched some conversion videos on youtube, and almost invariably the reason people convert to Islam is not because of the doctrine, but because of how good they feel about some Muslim friends on a personal level.  That\u0027s a serious concern because while these folks probably don\u0027t read all of Qur\u0027an, don\u0027t read ahadith, don\u0027t study Muslim history in all their gory details, may not know what \"Deobandi thinking\" is and so on, they decide it\u0027s a good idea to support and directly or indirectly help spread this dangerous doctrine just because they feel good about a person.  That\u0027s just unsound thinking.  If you\u0027re going to adopt a religion, nice community is a good thing for sure, but **do** check out the doctrine first and foremost, and try to understand what it is you are spreading.\n\nAlso people who hide the ugly side of the doctrine while putting out fuzzy feelings up-front are dishonest salesmen.  You know how lots of people get converted?  From Sufism.  And Sufis don\u0027t talk about amputating limbs.  They don\u0027t get on a podium and get angry like a lot of Muslim clerics.  They smile.  They are kind.  They talk about nice fuzzy mystical stuff.  They never mention the harsh side of Islam.  So... on one hand, as Muslims, Sufis are probably some of the better people.  But as salesmen for Islam, Sufis are the most dishonest salesmen.  They put forward the very best of Islam, and absolutely obscure or even deny the worst.  I can even see myself hanging out with a Sufi sheikh and enjoying it.  But I would never convert to Islam.  And I would lean over and whisper into the sheikh\u0027s ear, \"Don\u0027t convert anyone to Islam... just share your spiritual wisdom as is.\"  And thankfully I even know of some sheikhs who do exactly that, but not enough, imo.\n\nHow many Muslims say stuff like this, \"Converting to Islam is free, but if you ever de-convert, be careful, because a lot of Muslims believe that ideally you should be punished by death for apostasy!\"  If Muslims talked this way, I bet they\u0027d get a lot fewer converts.  That, and mentioning other similar things about Islamic doctrine, its often violent history and its often strict and intolerant culture would be an honest sales job at least.\n\nThing to remember is... while you may just want a bunch of cool buddies to hang with, someone else is going to read the doctrinal writings of Islam and actually take them both literally and seriously.  And then what?  What kind of world are we creating?","duration":"","id":56,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_c40gcuy","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":55,"links":[2],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"x86_64Ubuntu","label":"If there were moderates would you hear them on FOX news ?

I do think that religion overall is a bad influence on people, so I can\u0027t not disagree with you there, but you make it sound like all Muslims are extremist nutcases.  Maybe you need to go out and meet some nice and pleasant moderate Muslims?\n\n\u0026gt; I don\u0027t want to sit here and pretend Islamic doctrine is acceptable when it isn\u0027t. I don\u0027t want to slaughter every Muslim or anything like that. In fact I want the wars to end as much as possible. However, I also think we need to speak out about Islam. We\u0027ve got to criticize it.\n\nThe Abrahamic religions do need to be criticized and I\u0027ll be one of the first to jump in...  but I wouldn\u0027t lump all Muslims together and say that they\u0027re all crazy extremists due to their religion.  That\u0027s a bit insulting..  not to mention not true.\n\nInterpretation of religion is a fundamental thing at play here.  You can interpret an old and outdated religious text hatefully, like extremists do..  or you can interpret it in a moderate way, like most Muslims do.\n\nIf the Koran is such an evil document that\u0027s inherently violent enough to cause all the problems we are seeing with Islam, then you can\u0027t really not say the same thing about the Bible - which might even contain more crazy bullshit than the Koran does.  \n\nTwo old religious texts, both filled with violent and crazy bullshit..  Two groups of people, one generally a lot more moderate than the other..  A whole bunch of extremists, mostly from a very specific part of the world.\n\nIf religion was all there was to it, you\u0027d see an equal number of extremists per capita all over the globe.  You don\u0027t.  They all come from a very specific place.   You should be directing your research there and trying to figure out why that is.\n\nedit: downvoted by God","duration":"","id":65,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_c40ij7m","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":63,"links":[62],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Nefandi","label":"\u0026gt;You\u0027ve got to understand that most of that bullshit you see from extreme Muslims is cultural - not religious. \n\nSorry, I am in a firm disagreement with you here.\n\n\u0026gt;The regions where the muslim crazies come from didn\u0027t have the benefit of an age of reason\n\nWhy not?

Turkey is in the middle of Islamization.  Besides, Turkey\u0027s recent rulers have been militantly secularistic.  You can\u0027t give Turkey 100% credit for secularism that was not of their free will.  It\u0027s like giving USSR citizens credit for being atheistic at a time when atheism was a government mandate in USSR.

But there are other problems.  Islamic attitude toward women.  Islamic attitude toward dogs and liquor.  Islamic ideas about punishment (very brutal and cruel).  Islamic attitude toward non-Muslims.  Islamic attitude toward apostasy.  In other words, even in a Muslim society where people don\u0027t strap the suicide vests on, you can often see the negative influence of Islam.  And the more Muslims in one place the worse it usually goes.  Muslims are at their best when they are very dispersed in low numbers across the West.  But get a bunch of them together, especially in the Middle East, Africa or India, and bad shit happens.  Militarism is just one bad dimension of Islam.  That\u0027s the jihad dimension.  But Islam has plenty of bad dimensions besides militarism.\n\n\u0026gt;if you blame Islam you\u0027re going to have to label every single moderate Muslim a potential extremist\n\nModerate Muslims provide a comfortable and supportive atmosphere for the more serious Muslims.  They may not support extremism directly, but they support a Muslim who is marginally more serious.  Then the marginally more serious Muslims supports another marginally more serious Muslim.  And so on.  So at the end of the day, everyone plays a part in making Islam what it is.  Moderates make Islam what it is by their silence and apathy in the face of Islamic excesses.  Also, even moderates won\u0027t criticize the Qur\u0027an.  \\*sigh\\*\n\nI don\u0027t want to sit here and pretend Islamic doctrine is acceptable when it isn\u0027t.

I\u0027ve seen how women are treated in strong traditional catholic communities even today, even in relatively modern cities in Brazil. The only things that are absent, comparing with radical muslims societies, are the acid mutilation and cliterectomy. The rest is there: the utter isolation of unmarried young women, rigorous clothing codes (you\u0027ll still find young women wearing veils and keeping their mouths shut while in mass in certain traditional catholic societies), submission to the husband, the impossibility of living an emacipated life without being harassed (and even raped or beaten, depending on the setting).   \n\nAnd those more terrrible things (mutilations and cliterectomy) are present in traditional christian communities in those regions of the world where muslims do them. They are ancestral practices from way before their conversion to christianity or islam. So, it\u0027s not a question of islam vs. christianity. It\u0027s a question of societies that didn\u0027t value individual liberties because they didn\u0027t went through the historical processes that happened in the west. \n\nAnd when it comes to superstitions, muslims have nothing on catholics and their veneration of relics.

However, I think there\u0027s more than enough (admittedly somewhat circumstantial) evidence that the overall march of the far right is discriminatory in nature toward women and minorities.  Witness the recent birth control nonsense, the so-called \"personhood\" bills in several southern states, the hardline stance against gay rights, the completely unwarranted restrictions on voting rights, etc.  Additionally, look at the HUGE increase in anti-government armed militia hate groups over the last 3 years.  To me (at the very least) it\u0027s no coincidence that the number of hard line right wing militias have ballooned in the years since the nation\u0027s first black president took office.  Imagine if *just a handful* of minority groups (or even ONE) formed armed militias... it would be the national crisis du jour for Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, and Glenn Beck.\n\nI sincerely mean no offense, but the \"low tax, small government, and personal responsibility\" mantra fits the mold of right wing \"talking points\" perfectly.  I don\u0027t mean to be demeaning when I say that, rather I am trying to illustrate that it could be found in virtually every Fox News pundit clip for the last 3½ years.\n\nThe tax thing is a huge difference you and I have - or maybe a huge similarity, although I doubt it.  The wealthiest Americans are taxed at the lowest rate since the 1950s and under the plan of the leading GOP candidate they would actually see a tax reduction while the rest of America would see a tax increase.  This is to say nothing of what this would add to the deficit.\n\nFrankly the deficit is, to me, way overblown.  Is it a serious issue?  Sure.  Is a \"sky is falling\" impending disaster?  No.  We are nowhere near as bad off debt wise as Europe (save Germany perhaps), for example.  Certainly our national debt is something to be dealt with, no question, but there are better ways to deal with it than tax cuts and more pressing issues.\n\nThe phrase \"personal responsibilty\" began surfacing in very high usage in early 2009.  It was one of the many phrases from the rhetoric mill that is Frank Luntz.  As for small government, where were the right wing intelligentsia back when the vaunted Ronald Reagan was doubling the size of government?  Why won\u0027t the right wing do anything about out of control military spending?¹\n\nI do understand *some* of the appeal of the right wing...\n\nI am 48 years old.  My first vote in a national election was for Ronald Reagan in 1984 (I was a tad too young in 1980), but it was based on the ignorance of voting the way my family did.  My grandfather was a local GOP elected official in NC for decades, my parents voted Republican (surprising, given the fact that my father and mother were both anti-war college teachers in the 1970s), my wife is still a registered Republican (although she hasn\u0027t voted for a GOP presidential candidate since Bush I back in 1988 or \u002792).  Before I started understanding the political big picture, and started seeking news sources outside the mainstream, I fell right in line with the family tradition.  The last decade and a half have been nothing short of ~~incredible~~ INSANE in terms of how far off the deep end the GOP has gone.  Perhaps most amazing about the whole thing is the way the right wing masses gravitate toward pundits like Beck and Limbaugh, without questioning for a second the validity of their words.\n\nI didn\u0027t mean to get off on a \"bash the right\" rant... I really didn\u0027t.  But I sometimes get a little passionate in my replies.\n\nAnyway, thanks for answering my sincere question.\n\n___  \n\n¹  Ron Paul is the only right wing candidate to offer a plan that won\u0027t increase the debt, but it comes at an enormous cost to programs benefitting the poor.  On top of that, for all of Paul\u0027s anti-war rhetoric about bringing troops home from our foreign wars (something I agree with), he has no plan for them once they\u0027re back.  This leads me to believe he would be quite happy to have them homeless and not getting the *government paid* care they so desperately need (and will need for years to come).","duration":"","id":349,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_c40ez18","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":348,"links":[347],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Aggnavarius","label":"I\u0027m for a low tax, small government, and personal responsibility.
