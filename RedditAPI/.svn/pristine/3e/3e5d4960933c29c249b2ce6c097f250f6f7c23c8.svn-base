So the tax subsidy for such activities extends way beyond churches. And is probably much more significant in the case of PACs than 501(c)(3)s. \n\nI think that this aspect of religious taxation is actually relatively unimportant but is illustrative of a much bigger set of problems. Political speech is just on example of how churches are carrying on activities that don\u0027t look anything like what the drafters of the tax code had in mind when creating exemptions for religious organizations. I think it is also important to remember that non-charitable religious activities can also be very beneficial and there are good reasons to avoid interfering with them. Many people derive a lot of happiness and comfort from attending religious services. Most religious organizations are not run for profit and so would have a difficult time surviving if taxed. Personally I see no problem with traditional, core religious activities being exempt from taxation (though I am not sure whether the corresponding charitable deduction granted to those who donate to churches is a good thing). The problem is when churches stop looking like churches and start looking like empires.\n\nCurrently, 501(c)(3) organizations risk losing their tax-exempt status if they engage in political activities, if we ignore for the sake of discussion the lack of enforcement. But why? Why can\u0027t they engage in politics? I think that part of the idea was to maintain separation of church and state, by restraining religious organizations from being too active in politics. This seems like a weak justification in light of the First Amendment, which protects free speech. Why should religious leaders have less freedom of speech? Without going into the jurisprudence too much, this justification would almost certainly not hold up to a Constitutional challenge in court.\n\nI think the better and more likely explanation is that the rule allows people to give to churches and charitable organizations without having to fear that money be used for political purposes with which they do not agree. For example, a Catholic may vehemently oppose abortion and lobby for that extensively, but simultaneously may recognize that keeping the Church out of politics is important for the Church and our secular democracy. But again I have doubts as to whether this would hold up in court.\n\nEither way, I don\u0027t think political speech in churches is as significant of an issue as how many (c)(3) organizations appear to be carrying out activities that are not closely related to their legal purposes and the justifications for their tax exemption. 501(c)(3)s must be organized and run exclusively for one of a set of statutorily specified purposes, including religious, scientific, educational, charitable, and other purposes. Charity and religion are separate purposes, either or both of which suffice for (c)(3) status. Once an organization has that status, it is exempt from nearly all income taxation. That includes income from investments, of which the Mormon Church notoriously has many. \n\nThe assumption at the time the rule was written is that charitable organizations would not be run for profit and would not accrue significant wealth and economic power. The law is written so that it is illegal for a (c)(3) to have any owners or shareholders to whom profit is dispensed. Thus, unlike a corporation that issues dividends to shareholders, there would be no profit motive for a (c)(3). However, Mormon leaders have used the Church as a tool for empire building. Scientologists have done the same. Even though the leadership does not directly benefit in the form of profits, a wealthier church gives them more personal power and increases the opportunities for them to personally profit via increased benefits and salary. They have done so while simultaneously carrying out relatively few of the beneficial activities that we consider worthy of a tax subsidy.\n\nOn the other hand, many religious organizations are nothing like the Mormons or Scientologists. There are many small non-denominational churches that could not survive without the tax subsidy. They don\u0027t engage in the political activities so many here on Reddit object to. They are often active charitably in their communities and certainly provide comfort and happiness to hundreds of thousands of Americans. While you may not agree with their religion, I think it is fair to say that these organizations can be very beneficial and are worthy of tax exemption.\n\nBut how do we distinguish between the empire-builders and the \u0027good\u0027 churches? I think PAC taxation demonstrates one viable approach. The tax code specifies that any income received by a PAC is tax-exempt to the extent that it is used for specified exempt purposes.

Why can\u0027t they engage in politics?\n\nin my mind, it\u0027s because nobody should be able to put undue pressure on someone else in order to influence their vote.  many people in this country consider their religious leaders to have more authority over their lives than the laws do.\n\nin order for anyone to be prosecuted for a crime, they must first be caught by someone in law enforcement.  but with the indoctrination that \"god is always watching\" and that \"your immortal soul hangs in the balance\", people will be far more likely to act in accordance to what their religious beliefs deem \"legal\", even if that\u0027s in direct violation with the laws of the land.  because they think god is going to prosecute them in the afterlife.\n\nso even if you agree with candidate A on foreign affairs, taxes, spending, education, energy policy, and health care, and you think candidate B\u0027s plans won\u0027t work across the board, if a religious authority says \"candidate A is a horrible, immoral person, and goes against god\u0027s word.  a vote for candidate A is as bad as committing the same sins yourself!  but candidate B is a man of god!\" then you\u0027re going to be morally torn.  do you vote for the person whose policies you know make sense and will be good for the country?  or do you follow the dictate of your religious leader and \"save your immortal soul\"?","duration":"","id":86,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_c6t0xdw","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":85,"links":[84],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"stult","label":"Well Political Action Committees (501(c)(4) and 527 organizations) are not taxed on income (i.e. donations) that they spend lobbying on those same issues that you list as examples of churches engaging in politics in the guise of charity. So the tax subsidy for such activities extends way beyond churches. And is probably much more significant in the case of PACs than 501(c)(3)s. \n\nI think that this aspect of religious taxation is actually relatively unimportant but is illustrative of a much bigger set of problems. Political speech is just on example of how churches are carrying on activities that don\u0027t look anything like what the drafters of the tax code had in mind when creating exemptions for religious organizations. I think it is also important to remember that non-charitable religious activities can also be very beneficial and there are good reasons to avoid interfering with them. Many people derive a lot of happiness and comfort from attending religious services. Most religious organizations are not run for profit and so would have a difficult time surviving if taxed. Personally I see no problem with traditional, core religious activities being exempt from taxation (though I am not sure whether the corresponding charitable deduction granted to those who donate to churches is a good thing). The problem is when churches stop looking like churches and start looking like empires.\n\nCurrently, 501(c)(3) organizations risk losing their tax-exempt status if they engage in political activities, if we ignore for the sake of discussion the lack of enforcement. But why? Why can\u0027t they engage in politics? I think that part of the idea was to maintain separation of church and state, by restraining religious organizations from being too active in politics. This seems like a weak justification in light of the First Amendment, which protects free speech. Why should religious leaders have less freedom of speech? Without going into the jurisprudence too much, this justification would almost certainly not hold up to a Constitutional challenge in court.\n\nI think the better and more likely explanation is that the rule allows people to give to churches and charitable organizations without having to fear that money be used for political purposes with which they do not agree. For example, a Catholic may vehemently oppose abortion and lobby for that extensively, but simultaneously may recognize that keeping the Church out of politics is important for the Church and our secular democracy. But again I have doubts as to whether this would hold up in court.\n\nEither way, I don\u0027t think political speech in churches is as significant of an issue as how many (c)(3) organizations appear to be carrying out activities that are not closely related to their legal purposes and the justifications for their tax exemption. 501(c)(3)s must be organized and run exclusively for one of a set of statutorily specified purposes, including religious, scientific, educational, charitable, and other purposes. Charity and religion are separate purposes, either or both of which suffice for (c)(3) status. Once an organization has that status, it is exempt from nearly all income taxation. That includes income from investments, of which the Mormon Church notoriously has many. \n\nThe assumption at the time the rule was written is that charitable organizations would not be run for profit and would not accrue significant wealth and economic power. The law is written so that it is illegal for a (c)(3) to have any owners or shareholders to whom profit is dispensed. Thus, unlike a corporation that issues dividends to shareholders, there would be no profit motive for a (c)(3). However, Mormon leaders have used the Church as a tool for empire building. Scientologists have done the same. Even though the leadership does not directly benefit in the form of profits, a wealthier church gives them more personal power and increases the opportunities for them to personally profit via increased benefits and salary. They have done so while simultaneously carrying out relatively few of the beneficial activities that we consider worthy of a tax subsidy.\n\nOn the other hand, many religious organizations are nothing like the Mormons or Scientologists. There are many small non-denominational churches that could not survive without the tax subsidy. They don\u0027t engage in the political activities so many here on Reddit object to. They are often active charitably in their communities and certainly provide comfort and happiness to hundreds of thousands of Americans. While you may not agree with their religion, I think it is fair to say that these organizations can be very beneficial and are worthy of tax exemption.\n\nBut how do we distinguish between the empire-builders and the \u0027good\u0027 churches? I think PAC taxation demonstrates one viable approach. The tax code specifies that any income received by a PAC is tax-exempt to the extent that it is used for specified exempt purposes. PACs are technically supposed to be taxed on any income put towards non-exempt purposes, meaning those that are not intended to affect an election. Whether that law is enforced is unclear, but I\u0027d say it is only lightly enforced if at all. That\u0027s partly attributable to the relatively recent explosion in PACs.

The good they do is good, but with dishonest intentions and with harmful baggage.\"\nThere\u0027s nothing dishonest about going to a health clinic and offering to treat people for serious diseases.  There\u0027s also nothing dishonest about telling people when the evangelical piece will be taking place, should the person be interested.  There is absolutely nothing dishonest or manipulative about anything done, despite your claims to the contrary.\n\n\"You bring doctors and ignorance, and over the long term the religion you spread, superstitious ignorance, an assault on reason, causes greater harm than your doctors do good. Take the catholic church for instance. All their supposed fighting against poverty, a cover for evangelizing, brings with it ideas that cause the very problems they claim to want to solve. How many people have died because of the church\u0027s position against condoms? How many people have sunk further into poverty because of the church\u0027s position against birth control?\"\nI find it fairly sad that you would spout out with any kind of authority about the kind of Church work being done overseas when it\u0027s clear from your post that you have absolutely zero context about it whatsoever.  If you\u0027re going to complain about \"an assault on reason\" I would suggest using well researched reasoning to support your claims, rather than fleeing to your established heuristics based nothing on what seems right or correct to you, rather than researched and established facts.\n\nLet\u0027s start with the obvious, that doctors, or well learned and hard working men with a lifetime of scientific training, generally aren\u0027t bringing \"superstitious ignorance\" and \"an assault on reason\" to the table when they\u0027re giving dialysis treatment, open heart surgery, dental work, etc. to the rural populations that lack health care.  \n\nNext, you bring up the Catholic Church\u0027s \"cover for evangelizing\" as simply a given.  I know it\u0027s hard to believe when you come from such a cynical place wrt religion, but it is possible for religious people to do religiously motivated things (feeding hungry, healing sick) without the ulterior motive of saving savages.  Doing good is the right thing to do in the eyes of God in and of itself, even if the local population has no interest in going to optional bible study later on.  There\u0027s no requirement to \"ABC: Always Be Closing\" for many of these mission trips.  Healing sick people is the end game, and if some of them want to learn more about Jesus, all the better.\n\nFinally, you bring up the Catholic policy on birth control as some kind of worldwide problem that causes poverty.  Let\u0027s just assume for a moment that you are aware of the birth rates among adherents to animism, islam, catholic, protestant, and atheists in the bush of Burkina Faso (*snicker*) so I shouldn\u0027t have to tell you that access to contraception isn\u0027t a problem exclusive to Catholics.  I\u0027m not Catholic and so I can\u0027t speak specifically to that policy (which I obviously don\u0027t support), but you ignore other things Catholics do bring to remote areas that are incredibly helpful with poverty relief and lowering birth rates.  Namely, education, access to clean water, free health care, basic sanitation, cooperative farming organization, etc.\n\n\"If you really want to help, bring the doctors, but leave religion and other superstitious bullshit at home. You don\u0027t need religion to do good, you are better without it.\"\n\nWe bring the doctors and let the locals decide if they want to hear about Jesus.  No litmus test.  I can\u0027t imagine what more you require other than the doctors simply stop being Christians.  I certainly agree that you don\u0027t need religion to do good, but would disagree with the second part.\n\nWhat I\u0027m basically reading from you is \"I don\u0027t like religion, and I have no idea about how things like medical mission trips actually work, but I can pretend like I do and bash religion while doing so.\"  If you have a viewpoint about religion making he world a worse place, that\u0027s a fair point to be discussed elsewhere.  If you have a viewpoint that Christian medical professionals providing access to healthcare abroad is a bad thing because religion is a bad thing, well, we disagree.","duration":"","id":97,"color":"black","redditID":"t1_c6thi64","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":95,"links":[94],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"tornvagina","label":"\u0026gt;There was an evangelical component.\n\nThat\u0027s exactly my point.

I really don\u0027t see how that or the crusades are relevant today, but there you go.\n\nI don\u0027t see what the red scare has to do with religious institutions.  But I\u0027ll assume you\u0027re right, and if we\u0027re counting stuff as far back as that as relevant, the US government has done far, far, far worse.  Project MKULTRA was a lovely CIA experiment on brainwashing conducted on US citizens without their knowledge and/or against their will.  The Vietnam War wasn\u0027t exactly our proudest moment either.\n\nAs for Jehova\u0027s witnesses withholding treatment and churches campaigning against things like stem cell research or birth control, yeah, that sucks.  But extreme churches like Jehova\u0027s Witnesses are in the minority, and should be sanctioned.  And campaigning against stem cell research isn\u0027t solely a church thing. That and many of the other ignorant positions some churches hold like being anti gay rights are directly supported by government policies.\n\nObviously tax exempt organizations like churches have no place in politics and should be sanctioned if they do get involved.  But I don\u0027t think the money donated to them would be much better served going to the federal government.  And don\u0027t forget, the person I replied to was saying we should get rid of ALL tax deductions, even for legitimate non religious charities.
