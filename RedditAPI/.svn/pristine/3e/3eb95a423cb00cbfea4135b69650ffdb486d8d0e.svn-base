Barack Hussein Obama.  His father was a Muslim and then an atheist according to what I've read.  Barack's mother took Barack to the most populous Muslim country in the world when she got involved with another 3rd world foreigner whose religion I haven't seen mentioned.  Barack was not religious until after he began his career in politics in Chicago.  The Church he joined was founded and led by a man who has said things very reminiscent of stuff Nation of Islam guys say about the need for black power and unity in face of the horrors of white society.   So, when peole think a guy with a Muslim name, who was born to a Muslim father, who lived in a Muslim nation, and only nominally became Christian after getting into politics, might be Muslim I say that in a way they're smarter than all of the "sophisticated" observers who think it horribly ridiculous that someone could think Barack Hussein Obama is Muslim.  

Would you get mad at someone for thinking that [Adam Goldberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Goldberg), the guy who played The Hebrew Hammer, was Jewish?
You get upvoted fr attacking Bush but any suggestion that Islam might be incompatible with a democratic republic elicits instant downvoting.  I agree with you that people should want the best leader,not the best preacher.  
Hi Mango Man,

    Being Muslim is a negative thing if it means living in a Muslim nation.  Do you know anything about the quality of life in Saudi Arabia and Iran and Indonesia and Pakistan and...

Oh, that's right, political correctness tells you that all religions are equally good/bad and that there are no meaningful differences between cultures that could lead one to any preferences.
Ahh yes, all the problems of the Muslim world are our fault.  This is the most deluded narcissism and the biggest insult to Muslims.  Islam has been causing problems since its start.  You know the first war the U.S. had to fight abroad was due to Muslim sponsored and rationalized pirates who were plaguing commerce in the Mediterranean.  They would take peole as slaves off ships and demand randsoms and protection money.  The Barbary Wars.  Look into it.  One of the reasons the U.S. decided to go from the Articles of Confederation to the Constitution was the Muslim menace.  We had to establish the U.S. Navy to deal with rampant piracy.  When Jefferson demanded an explanation for Muslim perfidy in the region the diplomat explained that Muslims were not bound to respect any treaties with infidels and that their holy book justified all that they did to Americans.
Being Muslim is bad if it means you think Mohammed was a good guy and role model.  If being Muslim means pretending to believe the harmful ideology of your parents until they die so that you can inherit their stuff and then live according to something better than the Koran, well then being a Muslim isn't too bad.
In American politics it is not good for a candidate to be sincerely Muslim because Islam is not "just another religion" but a political philosophy as well.  Muhammad was not just a religious figure, but a political war leader, which is he took #1 in Hart's [The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_100).  He didn't just start a big religion, but an empire.  He didn't just inspire people's religious fantasies, but dreams of conquest.  Islamic values are not compatible with the form of democratic republic we have in the United States or most developed nations.  Sharia is not compatible with our conception of human rights and due process.  It is a crime punishable by death to leave Islam in Islamic nations, but in the U.S. we value religious freedom.  I know that it's politically correct to be an idiot and generalize that all religion are really the same and that they're all equally good/bad, but it's not the case.
I didn't say being a Muslim makes you a bad person.  As for guessing what someone believes based on what they tell you...  If someone tells me they're a Mormon I should be able to guess that they believe Joseph Smith was some sort of prophet at the very least.  If someone tells me they're a Nazi I should be able to guess they think Hitler had some good ideas and aspirations, at the very least.  You need to think more critically.  If you tell me you're an atheist i'll reasonably conclude you don't believe in God, right?  I mean, by definition such self-identifications mean something. Sure, a guy could lie and say he's a Muslim but not mean it, but then I'd still have reason not to trust him with power over me.
It's not fair that anyone stumbles over a foreign Muslim name!!  Why must people view Islam with any suspicion?  [Islam has always wanted to embrace the West with such passion.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vienna) 
Right, a politician would never lie or dissemble.  If Obama says it it must be true.  I don't think Obama is a covert Muslim, but I wouldn't be surprised to learn that at some point in his life he was saying the [Shahadah.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahadah)  His father was a Muslim before being an atheist. His mother ran off with a man to Indonesia  and brought Barack Hussein with to the most populous Muslim nation.  Barack doesn't strike me as a Muslim, but he may have real Muslim sympathies and may well have been exposed to Muslim indoctrination in his youth.  Rejecting this possibility on the word of a lawyer and politician is your prerogative, but I prefer rational skepticism when it comes to politics.
Yes, because Islam is the same thing as race... P.c. be damned, it's the enemy of free thought.
I'd much rather have [Dr. Carson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Carson) or Clarence Thomas or Thomas Sowell as president than Hillary Clinton.
Skin color and creed are quite different.  In America we have no religious test for office, but in the U.K. Catholics are still banned from serving as Prime Minister.  I think that bias against Catholics in the year 2007 is worthy of scorn, yet I understand why it is a black person can be prime minister but not a Catholic.  I think Blair wouldn't have been worse or better had he been allowed to convert and that the U.K. should do away with that restriction.

As for a Muslim becoming President of the United States of America, perhaps we should think hypothetically about members of other religions being elected to the most powerful office on the planet.  Should Americans consider electing a candidate who declares he is personally a devout Satanist but that his private worship of the devil in no way would influence how he leads the nation?  Let's say a Branch Davidian wanted to be elected President and when pressed declared that David Koresh was a prophet but that what happened at Waco was a moment from his religion's past, should people accept that this private religious affiliation didn't have bearing on leadership ability?  Maybe a practitioner of Ayum Shinriko wants to rule, does this strike anyone as troubling?

In the largely secular West people tend to think of religion as little more than a private tradition which takes up at most an hour or so on the weekends, but this is not the case for sincerely devout people.  A devout Jew is Jewish not just on Saturdays and the same goes for anyone who is sincerely religious.  Different belief systems lead to different world views.  A Manichaean would be a very different President than a Donatist.
[This is the most recent article I recall, but it concerns the royalty.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/08/03/npeter103.xml) Excerpt:

&gt;Peter Phillips, the Queen's eldest grandson, may have to give up his place in the line of succession to the throne after it emerged that his bride-to-be is a Roman Catholic.

   
&gt;Peter Phillips is engaged to Autumn Kelly, a Canadian who was baptised as a Catholic

 
&gt;The engagement between the 29-year-old son of the Princess Royal and Autumn Kelly, a Canadian management consultant, was announced by Buckingham Palace last week. But no mention was made that Miss Kelly, 31, had been baptised as a Catholic, a fact that could prove embarrassing to the Royal Family and the Government.

&gt;The 1701 Act of Settlement bars monarchs and their heirs from becoming or marrying Catholics, a source of anger for Church leaders who have repeatedly called for its repeal. Under the Act, Mr Phillips will be required to renounce his right to the throne - he is 10th in line at present - or Miss Kelly will have to formally give up her membership of the Church.

[You won't easily find the law regarding the Prime Minister, but that's because so much about the position isn't codified.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom)

It's late so I will leave it to you to do more googling to find a discussion of why Blair waited until after being Prime Minister to formally become Catholic.  Not sure if you will find a written law that names the P.M. specifically, but apparently to the extent he serves at the request of the monarch(considered a formality)and is in line to becoe monarch he can not be Catholic.
Omniscience.
A candid admission of human fallibility-- you have no future in politics.  You're welcome.  Omniscience without omnipotence would be really frustrating.
Nam et ipsa scientia potestas est. - Bacon

Maybe.

As for omniscience, it would allow you to know the probabilities of future events, but not the outcomes when genuine chance is involved.  Genuine chance seems to be more than a failure to perceive causal connections.
Could you provide me a list of the enlightened Muslim leaders so that I can appreciate why Muslim would be a positive or even neutral label for most?
You shall know the tree by its fruits.  I've studied the fruits of Islam and can confidently declare that Islam is far worse than Christianity. I know that on Reddit the dominant dogma is that all religions are false, but when you actually study history you conclude that there's something special about Judaism and Christianity.  
Islam was regression.  It came centuries after Christianity and took morality backwards and sideways.  Check Thomas Jefferson on the subject if you want the opnion of a smart man who didn't go for any revealed religions.
