Yes, it would matter. Moslems enslave half the human race, my half. I would never vote for or support one. 
Blacks don't make up half the human race though I can understand your bitterness. Though you might also look up moslem involvement in the African slave trade. 
I have never read that Asians were a significant source of slaves for Europeans. 
Well, screw Timothy. 

I'll take Galatians 3: 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.

&gt;We know for a fact that Paul allowed women to speak prophetically in the assembly (1 Corinthians 11,5). Women functioned in the Church as deaconesses. We know, therefore, that women did speak in the assemblies. 1 Timothy 2,12 is an exception, a later ruling to counteract a specific threat. 
I don't really care if they hate Americans. Considering the actions of our capitalist class that seems a reasonable response. But moslems and their religion do subjugate women. It's one of the prime purposes of their religion. At no point in Islam are women equal, or independent. 
It depends on the sect. Quakers, for instance, always had equality.
