I have a new theory. Trump was the establishment candidate all along, but the GOP overlords knew they’d never win the support of the angry anti-establishment voters within their party unless they had someone play the part of the rogue. This would explain why no deep pocketed super PAC from within the GOP has launched a nuclear assault against Trump (like they did with McCain). Trump threatening to run as an independent is just their cover for why they can’t do this. You also make sure the field is full of other candidates so the remaining republican vote is fragmented, but give all the airtime to Trump to guarantee his rising above them. As a rogue, Trump is free to say all the things the GOP wishes they could say, and in doing so, shifts the whole conversation so far to the right it breaks the needle. Trump gets nominated as the anti-establishment candidate, the GOP then turns its full arsenal on Hillary or Bernie under the protection of “at the very least, we can’t give the election to the Dems”, and in the end they get their boy in the White House with all the drunken hicks thinking that they beat the system by voting in someone who was one of them.

Somebody please shoot this full of holes so I can sleep better tonight.
Yeah, I never bought the Democratic double-agent theory. He'd eventually be discovered, and people would want his head. Plus, I'm sure he really does want to be president, and being a spoiler wouldn't personally net him anything other than Clinton gratitude.

As for the Muslim thing, if you're trying to rally the anti-establishment crowd, you need the establishment candidates to put on a good show of being outraged by Trump's actions, wouldn't you? I'm assuming all the candidates are pawns in the charade, whether they know it or not.

Prebus is doing exactly what he's supposed to. He's raising boatloads of cash from wealthy donors. They elected him unanimously for a 3rd term this year, "they" seem pretty happy with him, even with Trump crashing around the field. All that GOP money can buy a lot of really smart people to come up with all kinds of strategies and schemes to gain GOP power. This part, I am certain is going on. Everyone said this election was going to be a cake walk for Hillary. I'm sure they were willing to try something a little unorthodox in order to fight such a strong political opponent. What did they have to lose?

Trust me, I don't want any of my theory here to be true. I just want to be absolutely certain it isn't before I dismiss it. Trump's strange rise to dominance just doesn't add up, which makes me think there's something going on behind the scenes.
Ooo. A good answer and a credible source. Upvote for you.
Yeah, yeah. You think it is stupid. Great. Now tell me specifically why Trump couldn't be part of the GOP establishment.
It's absolutely more likely that he's just a loose cannon, but is it possible that he's not? The GOP wouldn't have to micromanage him, just set the pieces in motion with the understanding that once he's in office, he'd stick to their agenda.

There have been sporadic super PAC attacks agains Trump from the republican side, but not at all the ferocity I'd expect. He just threatens to run as an independent, and the ads go off the air. Is is really that easy to defeat big PAC money? Seems suspicious to me.
I was going to write something mean and nasty, but I'll take the high road here and just point out that it's better to contribute something of substance to the discussion rather than just be insulting, even if you strongly disagree with my post.
&gt; You honestly believe the GOP is a puppet master over all of the GOP candidates with a master plan to put Trump in office

You honestly think they're not deciding (or trying to decide) who is nominated and who isn't?

I'm willing to ignore the insults (which really aren't necessary, and make you difficult to take seriously), but I shouldn't have to tell you that our government has been proven to have done all kinds of things which were once considered conspiracy theories, so I try to keep that in mind when assessing what might be possible. I don't think my original post is very likely, but I'm curious as to whether it could be true, and for that, I though I'd initiate a discussion.

What makes you so quick to hurl insults and dismiss me? You're not actually a Trump supporter are you?
