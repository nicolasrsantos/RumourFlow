That we should just vote for Obama despite NDAA, drone strikes, carpet bombing of civilians in Yemen, assassination of American citizens on foreign land with no judicial process in the so-called "due process," no justice for Wall St financial criminals, no closure of Guantanamo or release of prisoners there who were recommended for clemency, warrantless wiretapping, etc., just because he's a superior candidate to Romney.

Obama is, of course, a vastly superior candidate to Romney, who has no character whatsoever. But the prevailing wisdom that we should lay down our pro-peace values and vote for Obama as a lesser of two evils seems a very empty attempt at ethical democracy indeed. There is significant pressure from so-called progressive people to vote for Obama, few of whom are at all conscious of the damning issues listed above.
I agree. That argument, if you'd call it one, is a massive copout.

Obama is clearly preferable to the alternative on this main issue of war, as his Republican opponents ludicrously clamor for war with Iran.

I won't argue that Obama has been vastly less destructive, vastly less warmongering than Bush was or Romney would be - however, Obama's foreign policy is definitely murderous. He's done things for which I would never forgive anyone.
You'd think America would have learned such a lesson in the most recent Iraq War! And I agree, I don't think any country in the world could "defeat" Iran. They always rally as a nation.

And as for your final rhetorical flourish - I've found in my life that the American solution to dead Americans has been to clamp down on American freedoms and generally disgrace the ideas this country was founded on. Like, uh..... uh.... freedom.
*Moral character. I don't think anyone would take seriously the idea that Mitt Romney is not a duplicitous, opportunistic liar. He has shown not a single serious ethical scruple over the 10 years I've seen him act like an asshole on television.
I was referring to the fact that I am pro-peace.
Thorny issue.

While this guy was clearly an asshole, he was an American citizen, murdered by a drone strike in Yemen with not a shred of due process. They also killed his 16 year-old son the same way. It's an absolute disgrace.
If you look at the way the Obama administration has furiously pursued every possible legal avenue to protect its right to abduct anyone they want:

Not to mention how they have held innocent people indefinitely at Guantanamo until they fucking *died* despite multiple recommendations that they be released:

I think such cases indicate that you're wrong, unfortunately. Especially in view of the fact that Obama has clearly violated his campaign promises to stop these abuses and thereby trashed his integrity as a statesman, the test of time has shown that Obama is most certainly not a serious candidate for change.

He would be less constrained in a second term, but seeing as there has been, for example, **ZERO** justice for financial criminals, **NO** indications that Gitmo will be closed, any only escalation of the erosion of civil liberties under Obama by wiretapping, NDAA, etc., I think this is actually a very bad thing. He would be less constrained, taking his reelection as a mandate to take such policies further.

I'm personally not voting. I don't like it any better than you, but I don't endorse murder with my name. The government pays for atrocities with my tax money, that's bad enough already.
