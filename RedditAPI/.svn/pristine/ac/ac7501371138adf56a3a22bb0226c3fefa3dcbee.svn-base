portable oxygen system for ambulatory patients and the heimlich chest drain valve or flutter valve which drains blood and air out of the chest cavity   heimlich born in wilmington delaware to philip and mary epstein heimlich graduated from new rochelle high school ny in  and from cornell university where he served as drum major of the cornell big red marching band with a ba in  he received his md from the weill cornell medical college in  on june   heimlich married jane murray daughter of ballroomdancing entrepreneur arthur murray heimlichs wife coauthored a book on homeopathy with maesimund b panos called homeopathic medicine at home she also wrote what your doctor wont tell you which advocates chelation therapy and other alternative therapies heimlich and his wife had four children phil

heimlichs memoir heimlichs maneuvers my seventy years of lifesaving innovation was published in  by prometheus books heimlich first published his views about the maneuver in a june  informal article in emergency medicine entitled pop goes the cafe coronary on june   the seattle postintelligencer reported that retired restaurantowner isaac piha used the procedure to rescue a choking victim irene bogachus in bellevue washington from  to  the chokingrescue guidelines of the american heart association and of the american red cross taught rescuers to first perform a series of backblows to remove the fbao foreign body airway obstruction if backblows failed then rescuers learned to proceed with the heimlich maneuver aka abdominal thrusts after a july  american heart association conference backblows were removed from chokingrescue guidelines from  to  the published guidelines of the american heart association and the american red cross recommended only the heimlich maneuver as the treatment for choking the nih still does for conscious persons over one year of age as does the nsc the chokingrescue guidelines published by the american heart association ceasedwhen referring to the heimlich maneuver and instead called the procedure abdominal thrusts the new guidelines stated that chest thrusts and back blows may also deal with choking effectively in spring  the american red cross downgraded the use of the heimlich maneuver essentially returning to the pre guidelines for conscious victims the new guidelines nicknamed the five and five recommend first applying five backblows if this method fails to remove the airway obstruction rescuers will then apply five abdominal thrusts for unconscious victims the new guidelines recommend chest thrusts a method first recommended in a  study by charles guildner with results duplicated in a year  study by audun langhelle the  guidelines also eliminated the phrase heimlich maneuver and replaced it with abdominal thrust allegations of case fraud have dogged heimlichs promotion of abdominal thrusts as a treatment for drowning the  drowning rescue guidelines of the american heart association did not include citations of heimlichs work and warn against the use of the heimlich maneuver for drowning rescue as unproven and dangerous due to its risk of vomiting leading to aspiration in  heimlichs colleague dr edward patrick issued a pressrelease portraying himself as the uncredited codeveloper of the maneuver i would like to get proper credit for what ive donebut im not hyper about it in  heimlich introduced a chest drainage flutter valve also called the heimlich valve he claims his inspiration came from seeing a chinese soldier die from a bullet wound to the chest during world war ii the design of the valve allows air and blood to drain from the chest cavity in order to allow a collapsed lung to reexpand from the early s heimlich advocated malariotherapy the deliberate infection of a person with benign malaria in order to treat ailments such as cancer lyme disease and more recentlyupdate hiv as of update the treatments were unsuccessful and attracted criticism as both scientifically unsound and dangerous the united states food and drug administration and centers for disease control and prevention have rejected malariotherapy and along with health professionals and advocates for human rights consider the practice atrocious the heimlich institute a subsidiary of deaconess associations of cincinnati conducted malariotherapy trials in ethiopia though the ethiopian ministry of health was unaware of the activity reportedly the trials were supervised by mekbib wondewassen an ethiopian immigrant who works as a car rental agent in the san francisco area heimlich claims that his initial trials with seven subjects produced positive results but refused to provide details the experiments had no institutional review board oversight studies in africa where both hiv and malaria occur commonly indicate that malariahiv coinfection increases viral load and that malaria could increase the rate of spread of hiv as well as accelerate disease progression based on such
