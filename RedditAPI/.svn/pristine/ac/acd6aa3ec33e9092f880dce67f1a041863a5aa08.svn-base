It was soon discovered the treasurer, even with several layers of oversight, had been just spending the money on personal purchases and then started to gamble to make the money back. There was a massive cover up made by his friends (the council that run the con at this point was effectively made up by social groups that rivaled each other) and even though the organization has 100s of people in it, less than a dozen controlled the whole event of its spiraling downfall. \n\nDespite being by far one of the most popular and defiantly the most community supported convention in my city, it died hard.

It was mainly the US and Europe that opposed Blatter, but by population, the US and Europe are still in the minority.

But they had a Viking infestation. A Danish house ruled intermittently in 1013-1014 during the House of Wessex\u0027s span as the royal line. Then again from 1016-1042. Before being again ousted by the House of Wessex for good. Before being ousted by the French Normans under William who was born in Normandy. He was succeeded by Henry I who was likely born in England by most accounts. But Henry I was succeeded by Stephen of Blios when he usurped Henry\u0027s daughter, Matilda, for her claim to the throne. As his name suggests, he was born in the French county of Blios.\n\nStephen eventually gave succession of the throne to Matilda\u0027s son because his own had died. Now, Matilda had been married to William of Anjou (the Norman\u0027s main competitor in France) to create an alliance. So their son ushered in the Angevin Empire which held a swathe of France as well as the throne to England. And it was their preference to focus on French affairs and didn\u0027t view England as their home. It was an extension of their empire.\n\nThe last Angevin king was good, old King John of Robin Hood fame. Younger brother of Richard the Lionheart and touted asshole. If you\u0027ll remember he is ousted by the Barons of England backed by the French and forced to sign the Magna Carta. This left King fucking Louis VIII of *France* as King to England. Which the Barons and people were cool with, actually. But Louis admitted he was never really king and handed over power to the appropriate parties for a hefty sum.\n\nThis begins the official start of the Plantaganet kings, Henry III. The reason he is considered different is because Richard the Lionheart\u0027s death while campaigning had created a succession crisis in the Angevin\u0027s French holdings of Normandy, Brittany, and Anjou. His nephew Arthur was pit against King John and ultimately John was only nominated to hold onto Normandy (and England). And from Henry III onwards you have a shit ton of born and bred English monarchs.\n\nUp until the Stuarts, who were the Scottish royals and followed after Elizabeth I, daughter of ol\u0027, nasty Henry VIII, founder of crazybasterdism, erm, the Church of England. The Stuarts keep going until that whole Commonwealth thing. Then the Stuart heir-in-exile Mary II of England is invited back and rules as equal with her husband William of Orange, who is famously Dutch. Then it\u0027s Queen Anne and the Acts of Union. Which consolidates Scotland and England as under one crown.\n\nAnne died with no children so the crown went to George I of the House of Hanover, who was related to King James VI of Scotland (And King James I of England) as the great grandfather on the maternal line. As the line suggests, he was born in Hanover, which isn\u0027t in England for you folks slow on geography. It\u0027s in Germany (though it wasn\u0027t Germany at the time). Whose son was George the II, last king born outside of England.\n\nThus making the guy above me correct.

When he was first elected, he created a scheme where FIFA gave every 209 nations $1 million + for football development at the grass root level. Here in Europe, especially in England, that sort of money makes no difference, but in smaller countries, esp those is Asia, South America and Africa, that money goes a long way, even if a too much goes to corrupt officials, he is seen as the man who builds pitches and academies in countries where if it wasnt for him, they wouldn\u0027t have them. Furthermore with your point about UEFA withdrawing from the WC, surely it wrong that roughly 25% of countries, the richer ones, have so much influence. That is not fair. If Prince Ali had been elected, personally I feel the World Cup (event) would remain on a closed circuit of A lister European Countries, with a few other rich nations. SA 2010 was probably achieved by corruption, but it was a success. I agree that Qatar is stupid, but you see my point. And finally I think you underestimate Blatter. In Europe, we have a conception that Blatter stayin in power is our lack of action. You don\u0027t stay in power that long without being smart and ruthless. A lot of people underneath him might not be so smart, but I seriously doubt whether any agency/law enforcement will be able to link him to the corruption.

Then the votes were counted by hand. It took a good hour and forty-five minutes. After all that, Blatter was winning 133-73. But it wasn\u0027t a 2/3 majority, so they would\u0027ve had to do the whole thing again had Prince Ali not conceded. Prince Ali knew that 30 people wouldn\u0027t change their vote so he just saved them having to sit there another hour.
