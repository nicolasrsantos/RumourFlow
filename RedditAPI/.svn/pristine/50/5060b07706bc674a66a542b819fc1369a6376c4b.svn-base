I would imagine that the basis for that is not really understanding how a child could be a different religion than its father.
In other western democracies, you wouldn't necessarily have to if the name of his party showed the religious affiliation.
Christian Democrats, Christian Democracy...
No.  In most European countries there are parties that follow the Christian Democratic movement.   
  
My point is that there wouldn't be an issue about what religion a politician is because Christian Democrats are pretty up front about their religious affiliation.   
  
Another example is the Islam Party in Belgium.  Once again, there is no question as to the religious affiliation of that party's candidates.
Angela Merkel of Germany is a member of the Christian Democratic Union - hardly fringe.
