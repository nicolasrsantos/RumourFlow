Now, I\u0027m relatively new to LoL. I started playing at the end of Season 2 and started watching streams as I was already a member of Twitch. After watching the pros play I was inspired by their intelligent approach to the game and using abilities in ways I would never have thought of flashing into a bush instead of over the nearby wall, Hotshot\u0027s nid seemingly able to jump over every wall in game, baiting, etc. \n\nOne streamer caught my attention over the others, however, and that was Voyboy. When I first saw his [Olaf 2v1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dHjOBv8SlVb4) in the Season 3 Qualifier I was blown away. This is what a pro looks like. They know when they have the upper hand and they exploit it to the fullest. After that game I watched and learned much from the Voyman those coming months watching his stream nearly every day, constantly learning how to approach the game with different champions and learning their limits. \n\nThen the Spring Split started and I watched as my favorite player\u0027s team steam roll the competition. Curse had my attention and kept it throughout the split win or lose I rooted for them. I became more attached to the other members as well. Often, watching Saint, and Jacky whenever they were streaming (and Voyboy wasn\u0027t). I watched their interviews and their charity causes and came to really enjoy their personalities.\n\nThen Summer Split started. They had a new roster(Привет друг!) and were facing new threats, yet I still believed in them. Then they lost, and lost, lost again, went back and then lost. But guess what?  I was still a fan. I still am a fan. Not because my team is 21 and 2. I am still a fan because Curse gives back so much to the community, and they are a good group of guys that have helped me understand the game more than I did before. \n\nIt was hard watching them lose in the beginning this is true. But that never made me want to jump on the C9 bandwagon(though I do respect C9 and think they are all incredibly talented). I stayed with Curse and wanted them to win because I cared about the future of their players. I wanted success for them so that they could continue in the scene.\n\nI guess my main message today is believe in your team and help them know that they have true fans. Don\u0027t come to reddit raging after Saint missed a smite, screaming for him to be benched. Instead I urge you to go to their stream post a \"Hey man, better luck next time!\" (Side note: Cop, if you read this pleeeeease stream more. You are the reason I started playing MF. And I would have totally gone on your chat and said \"Keep your head up bud.\" This community has been awful to you in the past, no one deserves that shit.) Show your team you support them through thick and thin, raise your dongers, do what you got to do. But don\u0027t ever drop them when they are playing poorly. That\u0027s when they need you guys the most.\n\nTL;DR: Put your team on your shoulders when they win, and be ready to catch them when they lose. Don\u0027t drop your team, it means a lot to these guys.\n\nEdit: Wow, thanks guys! Way to show your support. I just want to be clear, I\u0027m not condemning C9 or any other team people are a fan of. I watch all of the LCS games every week. I respect all of these guys they are living my dream.
