Now, you may ask yourself, why should I vote? What difference will one vote make?\n\nThe answer, my friend, is that reddit\u0027s algorithm makes it so that one vote contributes to increasing the visibility of that post. So then another person comes along, sees that someone got 10 or 15 upvotes, and realizes that maybe this comment is worth upvoting if some other people took the time to vote.\n\nThis is what an election is about! Yeah, it\u0027s unlikely that you personally will decide the election of the US president. Yeah, no one is gonna know that you were the first one to upvote that 5k karma comment on askreddit, but you will know. You will know that your vote got the person that visibility. It bumped them up.\n\nFlorida had a referendum on whether to legalize pot. Media told people that it was easily going to pass, so the young didn\u0027t go out and vote, but the old geezers did. It failed. \n\nYou can\u0027t sit there and go, \"I can\u0027t make a difference even if I vote.\"\n\nWell you sure as hell can\u0027t make a damn difference sitting on your ass at home! So go out and vote, make your voice heard, and spread the word! Those old people who vote against the issues that mean something to you are going to die. They\u0027re going to die soon, and they already had their chance to make the world better. \n\nSo vote, and make damn sure that the world you leave behind is one that you didn\u0027t just shrug and accept.

Millions of Americans who were sick of Obama wanted the GOP to put forth a candidate that was even kinda okay and the GOP put forth enough of an effort to make people say \"Well, Obama isn\u0027t great, but Romney is worse, so I\u0027m just gonna stick with Obama.\"\n\nThe GOP is actually a microcosm of a problem that plagues lots of people: Once a person becomes convinced that they are right about something, it becomes nigh impossible to convince them to listen to anything else.  Facts are \"lies\", evidence is \"fabricated\", they refuse to listen to anyone, because they don\u0027t want to admit they could be wrong - the honestly don\u0027t see how that\u0027s possible.  The modern Republican party is an example of what happens when you make a political party from this mindset.  When they have bad ideas, they double down on them and then complain that it\u0027s \"everyone else\" that \"refuses to compromise\".\n\nThe GOP -can- win in 2016, but in order to do it, they need to put forward a candidate that Democrat voters can relate to, with a message that DEMOCRATS want to hear.  A Republican governor just ran and won in Maryland in 2014 on a platform of \"We pay too much in taxes, and our budget is inflated.  I\u0027m going to cut the budget and I\u0027m going to cut taxes\" and he won, in a traditionally strong blue state because Democrats liked the message and supported it.\n\nThe thing that scares me the most about the way that the GOP is imploding on itself is that if they keep pissing off voters, they risk losing red states to swing and risk losing swing states to blue.  Even if you\u0027re a Democrat, this is a -bad- thing.  A one party country would be dangerous.

Consider this, if the Republicans were to phase out, then the Democrats would have a huge balancing act to be perfectly in the middle of ideologies so they can easily beat any third parties.\n\nHowever, an accepted fact is in primaries and caucuses, the delegates are way more extreme than the average voter of the party the delegate represents. Therefore, more extreme candidates are elected and thus one side of a generalized ideological spectrum gets alienated and creates a faction party or joins a third party. \n\nI suppose 2012 could be an example of extreme primaries. The Tea Party gained momentum coming into the election, felt energized due to the push from the movement, and, as a result, Republican candidates had to appear more extreme to capture the vote of those delegates who were sent by the flux of Tea Party voters.\n\nIn Presidential elections, becoming a party which dominates is difficult. Recent times, the Republicans did so with increased funding in the 70s-80s and a good economy throughout.\n\nIn Congressional, state, and local elections, dominating the entire country is impossible.

The problem is, this puts the primary and the general elections at odds, since in the primaries, people vote for who they feel best represents their ideas among their party when what they SHOULD be voting for is which person among their party is most likely to appeal to the OTHER party\u0027s voters.\n\n2012 was the GOP\u0027s election to lose, and boy howdy did they step up to the plate and swing away with not just one, but TWO candidates that were blatantly out of touch.  Millions of Americans who were sick of Obama wanted the GOP to put forth a candidate that was even kinda okay and the GOP put forth enough of an effort to make people say \"Well, Obama isn\u0027t great, but Romney is worse, so I\u0027m just gonna stick with Obama.\"\n\nThe GOP is actually a microcosm of a problem that plagues lots of people: Once a person becomes convinced that they are right about something, it becomes nigh impossible to convince them to listen to anything else.  Facts are \"lies\", evidence is \"fabricated\", they refuse to listen to anyone, because they don\u0027t want to admit they could be wrong - the honestly don\u0027t see how that\u0027s possible.  The modern Republican party is an example of what happens when you make a political party from this mindset.  When they have bad ideas, they double down on them and then complain that it\u0027s \"everyone else\" that \"refuses to compromise\".\n\nThe GOP -can- win in 2016, but in order to do it, they need to put forward a candidate that Democrat voters can relate to, with a message that DEMOCRATS want to hear.  A Republican governor just ran and won in Maryland in 2014 on a platform of \"We pay too much in taxes, and our budget is inflated.  I\u0027m going to cut the budget and I\u0027m going to cut taxes\" and he won, in a traditionally strong blue state because Democrats liked the message and supported it.\n\nThe thing that scares me the most about the way that the GOP is imploding on itself is that if they keep pissing off voters, they risk losing red states to swing and risk losing swing states to blue.  Even if you\u0027re a Democrat, this is a -bad- thing.  A one party country would be dangerous.  Personally, I\u0027d like to see the GOP change courses and start trying to adopt more Libertarian policies, but that\u0027s just me.","duration":"","id":188,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_cp9pbm7","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":187,"links":[117],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"noshoptime","label":"the problem isn\u0027t bush, or any candidate really.  the problem is the primary voters, the ones that felt that romney lost because \"he wasn\u0027t conservative enough\".  they will continue to push things further towards looney-land until the GOP wises up and finds a way to put up someone electable in a general election","duration":"","id":187,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cp9l8sz","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":117,"links":[116],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"lacker101","label":"\u0026gt; The Democrats have 2016 in the bag, as far as I\u0027m concerned.

I think I have a little to share on all three perspectives, and why one might switch from one to the other. I think it mostly boils down to institutional culture, and the way an individual experiences it.\n\nMormons are predominantly conservative. This pretty much cuts across all social, political and economic definitions. This intense conservatism certainly has its \"kookier\" sides, like denying evolution, free-market fundamentalism and accepting some really racist scriptures without much question, but these aren\u0027t really defining aspects of the Mormon experience. I think a lot of these issues simply don\u0027t matter to practicing Mormons. Things like family time, showing up in Church on Sunday, keeping the Word of Wisdom and paying attention to sports are far more important to your average Mormon. In a phrase, it\u0027s intellectually shallow. You preoccupy yourself with the mundane and let \"faith\" resolve all of the big issues.\n\nWhen I was in high school, I started developing a much stronger interest social justice issues, which was matched with a rational-humanist perspective on most big questions. It became obvious that the \"Bible wasn\u0027t written by God,\" that science is the path to empirical knowledge and that issues in the greater community mattered more than my moral standards. We\u0027d spend Sundays talking about the depravity of a Ricky Martin video, and I\u0027d go back to school to talk about the Song of Solomon. You start to get a feeling of the cognitive dissonance. \n\nAnyway, I put a deadline of Easter 1999 to get one last experience of \"truth.\" Instead of talking about redemption and sacrifice, Church was about some other petty moral issue. Most of my family members thought that it was pretty silly. I walked away and never went back.\n\nBut there\u0027s a funny side to being an atheist too, and you touch on it well. Atheists are often wont to say things like \"I don\u0027t believe any of them are real,\" and they have the same fundamentalist readings of the Scriptures that all of the Bible belters love. It turns out that both sides of this little debate can be wrong. You can read the Bible seriously (my Bible is the New Oxford annotated) and experience [religion as a metaphor for our relationship to the Universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dfr3ZnCRNO7Q). You can enjoy the sense of community, and you can see religion as a platform for social organization and campaigning. King, Malcolm X and Ghandi were all very religion people, and religion was a motivating force for each. \n\nJust because something isn\u0027t factual doesn\u0027t necessarily stop it from being true. It took awhile to figure that out.\n\nObviously, I\u0027ve made my choices, but I see the merit in all three viewpoints. Mormons, for all intents and purposes, are just conservative Christians. You don\u0027t do much thinking, but you enjoy your family and your community. You\u0027ll notice that they\u0027re happy and nice. And why wouldn\u0027t you if you fit comfortably into your small definition of how the world works? Atheism is great for developing a humanist viewpoint, but I also found it limiting. [To quote Heisenberg](http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/64309.Werner_Heisenberg) (the real one), \"The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you.\"\n\nAnd that\u0027s why I\u0027m a Christian.\n\n- TL;DR You\u0027ll find many crazy things about Mormons. They don\u0027t think much about any of it, and neither should you. They\u0027re conservative Christians, plain and simple. As a former Mormon and former atheist, I see progressive Christianity as the next step in rational humanist inquiry.","duration":"","id":208,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_cp9nt74","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":206,"links":[205],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Tyr808","label":"I\u0027m curious, why are you an ex-Mormon?

I think I have a little to share on all three perspectives, and why one might switch from one to the other. I think it mostly boils down to institutional culture, and the way an individual experiences it.\n\nMormons are predominantly conservative. This pretty much cuts across all social, political and economic definitions. This intense conservatism certainly has its \"kookier\" sides, like denying evolution, free-market fundamentalism and accepting some really racist scriptures without much question, but these aren\u0027t really defining aspects of the Mormon experience. I think a lot of these issues simply don\u0027t matter to practicing Mormons. Things like family time, showing up in Church on Sunday, keeping the Word of Wisdom and paying attention to sports are far more important to your average Mormon. In a phrase, it\u0027s intellectually shallow. You preoccupy yourself with the mundane and let \"faith\" resolve all of the big issues.\n\nWhen I was in high school, I started developing a much stronger interest social justice issues, which was matched with a rational-humanist perspective on most big questions. It became obvious that the \"Bible wasn\u0027t written by God,\" that science is the path to empirical knowledge and that issues in the greater community mattered more than my moral standards. We\u0027d spend Sundays talking about the depravity of a Ricky Martin video, and I\u0027d go back to school to talk about the Song of Solomon. You start to get a feeling of the cognitive dissonance. \n\nAnyway, I put a deadline of Easter 1999 to get one last experience of \"truth.\" Instead of talking about redemption and sacrifice, Church was about some other petty moral issue. Most of my family members thought that it was pretty silly. I walked away and never went back.\n\nBut there\u0027s a funny side to being an atheist too, and you touch on it well. Atheists are often wont to say things like \"I don\u0027t believe any of them are real,\" and they have the same fundamentalist readings of the Scriptures that all of the Bible belters love. It turns out that both sides of this little debate can be wrong. You can read the Bible seriously (my Bible is the New Oxford annotated) and experience [religion as a metaphor for our relationship to the Universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dfr3ZnCRNO7Q). You can enjoy the sense of community, and you can see religion as a platform for social organization and campaigning. King, Malcolm X and Ghandi were all very religion people, and religion was a motivating force for each. \n\nJust because something isn\u0027t factual doesn\u0027t necessarily stop it from being true. It took awhile to figure that out.\n\nObviously, I\u0027ve made my choices, but I see the merit in all three viewpoints. Mormons, for all intents and purposes, are just conservative Christians. You don\u0027t do much thinking, but you enjoy your family and your community. You\u0027ll notice that they\u0027re happy and nice. And why wouldn\u0027t you if you fit comfortably into your small definition of how the world works? Atheism is great for developing a humanist viewpoint, but I also found it limiting. [To quote Heisenberg](http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/64309.Werner_Heisenberg) (the real one), \"The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you.\"\n\nAnd that\u0027s why I\u0027m a Christian.\n\n- TL;DR You\u0027ll find many crazy things about Mormons. They don\u0027t think much about any of it, and neither should you. They\u0027re conservative Christians, plain and simple. As a former Mormon and former atheist, I see progressive Christianity as the next step in rational humanist inquiry.","duration":"","id":208,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_cp9nt74","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":206,"links":[205],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Tyr808","label":"I\u0027m curious, why are you an ex-Mormon?

Are we just going to forget the multitude of economic crashes caused by overextending the money supply\n\nCrashes are nearly the opposite of hyperinflation. Hyperinflation is what Zimbabwe deals with. Right now we\u0027re at nearly negative inflation numbers despite \"overextending\" the money supply. \n\nAustrian school economics simply don\u0027t work in the real world, and not the least of reasons why is because they don\u0027t actually use any hard number models for anything. They just sort of come up with an idea and posit it as *a priori* economic truth using their thought experiments.\n\nAnd as to the money supply, no modern economy could survive long if they tied their money supply to a tangible material. Economic growth depends on the amount of money available, and the absolute worst thing you could do is limit your economic growth to whatever the quantity of a metal is pulled out of the ground that year.\n\nOur currency isn\u0027t \"backed by nothing\", it is backed by the opinions of the entire planet and by the largest and most dynamic economy in history. Things are only worth the value that people assign to them, and modern currencies in developed economies have been given a lot of value.","duration":"","id":821,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_cpahm0k","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":820,"links":[819],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"hammy3000","label":"I realize we\u0027re sort of working within a casual limited comment space, but simply calling something crazy doesn\u0027t make it so or present any sort of argument.   \n\nSee, to me, as a voluntaryist/ancap, I think it\u0027s psychotic to think that money backed by nothing can possibly represent a stable currency.
