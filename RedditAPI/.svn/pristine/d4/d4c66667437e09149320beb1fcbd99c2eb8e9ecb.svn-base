Rickler is just cracking a joke!
People just do not like his skin color, but they can't say it out loud. So they picked a proxy 'talking point'.

It is the same thing in the Illegal Immigrates debates. Instead of saying 'we don't like Mexican, Asian and Indian', American choose to stress on the legal technicality of the issue. Then when they execute new laws selectively, they can effectively kick all the Latino butts whichever way they want it.
