Information technologies, in particular, are becoming more prevalent and significant components of modern military systems. These information technologies are having the same kind of transforming effects on military affairs as they are having in the larger world. The effects of this military transformation will have profound implications for how wars are fought, what kinds of weapons will dominate the battlefield and, inevitably, which nations enjoy military preeminence.\n\n\u0026gt; [...]\n\n\u0026gt; Any serious effort at transformation must occur within the larger framework of U.S. national security strategy, military missions and defense budgets. The United States cannot simply declare a “strategic pause” while experimenting with new technologies and operational concepts. Nor can it choose to pursue a transformation strategy that would decouple American and allied interests.  A transformation strategy that solely pursued capabilities for projecting force from the United States, for example, and sacrificed forward basing and presence, would be at odds with larger American policy goals and would trouble American allies.\n\n\u0026gt; Further, the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor. Domestic politics and industrial policy will shape the pace and content of transformation as much as the requirements of current missions. A decision to suspend or terminate aircraft carrier production, as recommended by this report and as justified by the clear direction of military technology, will cause great upheaval. Likewise, systems entering production today – the F-22 fighter, for example – will be in service inventories for decades to come. Wise management of this process will consist in large measure of figuring out the right moments to halt production of current-paradigm weapons and shift to radically new designs. The expense associated with some programs can make them roadblocks to the larger process of transformation – the Joint Strike Fighter program, at a total of approximately $200 billion, seems an unwise investment. Thus, this report advocates a two-stage process of change – transition and transformation – over the coming decades.\n\n\u0026gt; In general, to maintain American military preeminence that is consistent with the requirements of a strategy of American global leadership, tomorrow’s U.S. armed forces must meet three new missions:\n\n\u0026gt;• Global missile defenses. A network against limited strikes, capable of protecting the United States, its allies and forward-deployed forces, must be constructed. This must be a layered system of land, sea, air and spacebased components.\n\n\u0026gt;• Control of space and cyberspace.  Much as control of the high seas – and the protection of international commerce – defined global powers in the past, so will control of the new “international commons” be a key to world power in the future. An America incapable of protecting its interests or that of its allies in space or the “infosphere” will find it difficult to exert global political leadership.\n\n\u0026gt;• Pursuing a two-stage strategy for of transforming conventional forces. In exploiting the “revolution in military affairs,” the Pentagon must be driven by the enduring missions for U.S.  forces. This process will have two stages: transition, featuring a mix of current and new systems; and true transformation, featuring new systems, organizations and operational concepts. This process must take a competitive approach, with services and joint-service operations competing for new roles and missions. Any successful process of transformation must be linked to the services, which are the institutions within the Defense Department with the ability and the responsibility for linking budgets and resources to specific missions.\n\nThey want to stop building aircraft carriers and concentrate on high-tech research and development, missile defense, space and cyber-space. If you keep reading the chapter, they want to build up the American naval presence in east Asia--that is, China and Korea. The Mid-east is mentioned as one of many trouble spots in the world.\n\nWhat does 9/11 have to do with any of that?\n","duration":"","id":55,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cddcfe5","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Never thought of the 9/11 conspiracy this way","label":"khalifakid","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_1qicca","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.384341361E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.384382787E9,"simScore":0.7510196093687092,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":56,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"karlbarx","label":"this doesn\u0027t answer any of the major questions about 9/11.
