i think that was an astro-turf focus group that was assembled to spew right-wing talking points, instead of what it is purported to be, which is average iowa republicans giving their sincere opinions. 

this is like a case study in propaganda, polls, and the abuse of linguistics and statistics.

the frying pan is a new thing, probably less than 10 years old. i guess they have a "cowboy breakfast" a couple times a year in brandon that draws a good crowd.

i like to ask conservatives, 

"if barack obama is a muslim, why did he sit in rev wrights church for 20 years?"

conservatives usually snap back with something questioning the patriotism of rev wright. 

then i remind them that rev wright served in the USMC, and those who are questioning his patriotism are draft dodgers and chicken hawks... 

good times :-)
to be fair, in obamas book "dreams of my father', obama admits he sold POUNDS of drugs...
i had a man from the des moines area tell me that muslims do not have freedom of religion in america because islam is not a religion.

i thought he was joking, but he wasn't.

i wanted to ask him if i, as an american, with freedom of religion, have the right to convert to islam.
