The first duty of power is to perpetuate itself, and we don't even know who the actual powerful people are. Truman started the whole American tradition of secrecy after WWII, with Project Paperclip, in which the CIA put captured Nazi scientists to work on America's nuclear arsenal, the space program, and all this \"otherworldly\" technology they'd come across. (And you know what I mean.) Then they got Truman to create the super-secret Majestic 12 committee to oversee Project Paperclip, not to mention other weird stuff the government wanted hidden. They ran the whole thing, and they've been running it for years, but nobody knows who \"they\" are. But I'm pretty sure they're all Freemasons.\n\nThe whole Kennedy thing is so huge because it's at the center of so many other covert shadow-government operations. Kennedy himself was the smallest part of it, because it was actually a power play between Dulles' CIA, the anti-Castro military, LBJ, the Giancana Mafia, and a bunch of other dirty players. Oswald was a patsy, sure, but he put a gun on Jack. Of course, so did other test-mules from Dulles' MK-Ultra LSD-mind-control experiments. Zapruder was in on it, too: He was a KGB mole from way back. And the whole thing had ripple effects, like Jonestown, which was an assassin training camp that got found out. As for the Warren Commission, that thing was a joke—Dulles himself was on it, and there was only one person on the whole commission who wasn't on the CIA payroll and suspected Oswald didn't act alone. He died in a plane crash, after a young congressional aide named Bill Clinton drove him to the airport. It's all true, but nobody wants to admit it. Nobody.\n\nNow, Roswell, that's a bunch of crap. The Air Force was in possession of captured alien technology years before that. In '43, they started reverse-engineering a torus-shaped craft that came down in Arizona, and the next thing you know, America has The Bomb, supersonic aircraft, and a space program. Glenn saw stuff up there, flying lights. You can look it up. You know what I think? I think that skirt-chaser Kennedy wanted to spill the beans about our alien friends, so they killed him. He told his girlfriend Marilyn Monroe, and they killed her, too. No doubt, you're wondering, \"Who are 'they'?\" Well, I think the numbers speak for themselves: The Trinity site, where the first A-bomb was detonated; Dealey Plaza, where Kennedy bought the farm; and Area 51 are all on the 33rd parallel. And what other significance does the number 33 happen to have? It's the highest rank of the Masonic order. Wheels within wheels, my friend. Wheels within wheels.","duration":"","id":36,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_cutb7uv","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":35,"links":[3],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"moxy801","label":"IMO a lot of these reactionaries like Scott Walker are being bribed to run for President SOLELY to falsely make Jeb! look like a 'moderate'.","duration":"","id":35,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cut6fab","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":3,"links":[2],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"dezakin","label":"It's strange to me that he's being painted as a moderate, when he's the most likely candidate besides *maybe* Lindsey Grahm to get the US involved in another war to the tune of trillions of dollars.

I despise the fact PM Blair lead my country along with them, I wish he had the balls like the President of France to stand up and say No. They should all be on trail in the Hague for war crimes.

They surround the city, build trenches, keep the people from trading with neighboring city for food &amp; medicine, and even throw the occasional rock with catapults over the walls, to demolish a house or two. They keep this up for 10 years. And on the 10th year, the officers of the army meet to plan strategy.  And one group says \"we've been at this for 10 years, and they show no signs of surrendering! We have intel that says they're preparing a new super-weapon, so we should go to the next tool in the playbook, and launch an immediate infantry assault on the walls!\" Another group of officers goes \"But that intel is faulty, and not to be trusted! An all out attack is risky. Let's give the siege a few more years. It may work yet, and they may surrender in time!\"\n\nWhat our Dem propagandist liars are saying is that only the 1st group of officers is pro-war, and to blame for the war &amp; its victims. The 2nd group of officers are, according to them, pro-peace and anti-war. Which is complete, howling bs. Actually both sets of officers are warmongers intent on conquering the city.\n\nAnd it is incessant, non-stop lying like this by Dem partisan liars and liberal kooks that leave voters unable to parse &amp; understand political rhetoric, to figure out that politicians like Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, etc, are *imperialists,* and therefore pro-war, pro-mass-murder, pro-war crimes. That is how you end up with a population that cannot correctly appreciate the difference between supporting an imperialist like Barack Obama, or an anti-imperialist like Ron Paul. And walk away thinking that having supported Barack Obama means they sorta voted for peace.\n\nWhich is horseshit. Obama-supporters voted for a guy whose platform was \"I will escalate the Afghanistan war!\" Which means they voted for a guy who was promising to get even more Afghan women and children killed. A guy who was an imperialist and did not call for getting the fuck out of the region and closing all our foreign bases, bringing the CIA to heel, etc. In short, all those dead refugees drowned trying to reach Europe after fleeing Libya, Syria, Yemen etc, all those dead women and children from Hellfire missiles and bombs in Syria Iraq Afghanistan Yemen Libya etc, are *your* fucking fault, libs.

Sure, if you compare what the final output is, he doesn't look much better, but you need to consider input as well. The middle east was largely stable -- though brutal -- before the Iraq War: Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya were all known quantities with generally powerful governments, able to maintain order, or a decent enough approximation thereof, in their respective countries. After the Iraq War, Iraq lost the only entity able to keep three relatively distant groups (Kurds, Sunnis, Shias) under the rule of a single government. The power vacuum was not able to be filled with the institution of a democratic government that doesn't fix the distances between those groups.\n\nSimultaneously, many other countries in the region underwent revolutions -- violent or peaceful -- that saw the end of the rule, or end of that ruler's de facto power. Whether those revolutions can be traced back to the problems of the Iraq War is something I've read little about, but it seems like there is at least some room to relate the two, but there's also room to argue that they could have happened anyway -- regardless, they did happen, and would not have been preventable with further US action in the region.\n\nObama was elected at a time when the region had a giant, still unresolved, power vacuum in one of the two larger regional powers, with many other countries on the verge of creating similar power vacuums: under those conditions, he has worked with the limited resources available (because so many had been used up in the prior decade; were committed elsewhere; and/or lacked public support to use) to him to mitigate those problems, while also working to strengthen (well, sort of) some groups (e.g. the Kurds in Iraq) that could hopefully allow larger chunks of the region to be more stable in the longterm.\n\nOn the flipside, Bush was elected at a time when the region was largely stable and not on the verge of going into further issues.\n\nComparing the two based on the input and output, Obama has done significantly better on the region. That's not to say I don't have lots of criticisms for him (oh man do I have criticisms!) but instead to merely say that, despite the presence of many problems, the actual value-add of Obama is significantly higher (in that it is actually positive) than the value-add of Bush (in that it is negative) for outcomes in the region.","duration":"","id":7,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_clakerd","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":6,"links":[4],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"BroBeansBMS","label":"To be fair, has Obama done much better?","duration":"","id":6,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_clajnc9","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":4,"links":[3],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"--Kai--","label":"How dare you speak against the great Tony Blair and George Bush, after all the good they've done to create lasting peace in the middle east! /sarcasm","duration":"","id":4,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_clafipt","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":3,"links":[2],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"AveSharia","label":"I think he's claiming Bush killed a few hundred thousand.

According to CBS News, which obtained a copy of her book, she says: “I wasn’t alone in getting it wrong. But I still got it wrong. Plain and simple.�?\n\nWhat does \"use of force\" mean to you? There already was a \"no fly zone.\" Look for quotes from the leading Dems around the time of the vote. They knew exactly what they were authorizing. Later, when things started going badly, they began changing their views. Those changes are what you are trying to believe.","duration":"","id":54,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_clazbk0","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":53,"links":[45],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"theblackunicorn","label":"No, they voted to authorize use of force.

I'm glad for Obama's sake that there was some overlap in terms of personnel because, like Vietnam and the Bay of Pigs before it, the invasion of Iraq seems to be one big case of \"groupthink\". Essentially, every member wanted to appease their colleagues and bosses by aligning themselves with the prevailing sentiments, and when they eschewed (gradually) any \"devil's advocate\" thinking from the decision making process, they were left with only their set of theories and used them to create some of the intelligence \"facts\" we heard in the media. \n\nIt's not so much that Iraq and WMD's were an outright lie as much as the administration took what was very common intelligence (that Hussein was a giant douche was wanted a nuclear program and went about acquiring material) and ramped up the inevitability of war as a consequence of not stopping him. He never complied with UN sanctions for any meaningful amount of time, never allowed full access to inspectors, made up armament reports, and used chemical weapons on his own people. \n\nHe was a shed of tools, but he certainly wasn't going to launch an attack on the US. He struck me as a bit too regional for that kind of stuff. He was, I think, content with pissing off his neighbors, flipping off the UN, and doing what despots do.

It went something like this:\n\n**Me**: It is now clear that Iraq never had any WMDs, and had no active WMD program. \n\n**Him**: Well, we don't know. They might have been smuggled out of the country. \n\n**Me**: That's even worse! If true, it means they've gone from where we knew they were to where we don't! Osama bin Laden may have them now! Saddam was evil, but not crazy. He would have never used them to launch an attack on the United States, because that would have been suicide. We don't know that about whoever has them now. We may be in greater danger now than before the war!\n\n**Him**: Interesting point. \n\n**Me**: But WMDs were the whole moral predicate for the war. The American people have never found ousting tyrants alone sufficient cause for putting our troops in harm's way on that scale. To get us to support war, we had to be convinced there was a significant national interest at stake. In this case, the threat of imminent destruction by, in Bush's own words, \"thousands of tons\" of WMDs. \n\n**Him**: Yeah, I know. And I agree with them. We shouldn't put Americans lives at risk unless it's in our own interests to do so. It just doesn't make any sense to spill our own blood and treasure to try to save a world that doesn't want us to save it. \n\n**Me**: Worse, Bush never came out and said Iraq was behind 9/11. But he made sure to say \"Saddam Hussein\" or \"Iraq\" together in close proximity to \"9/11\" in almost every public appearance in the run up to war. That's an old trial lawyer's trick to imply a connection between two matters when they can't come and out say there's a connection because it's not true. It worked. Polling showed huge swaths of the American people--maybe even a majority--believed Saddam Hussein was partly responsible for 9/11. \n\nHim: Yup. What a bunch of bullshit. Hussein had nothing to do with 9/11. Bush all but lied us into war. \n\n**Me**: We've lost much of our foreign policy soft power--power rooted not in military force, but in persuasive appeal arising from moral leadership. Globally, billions of people now regard America as an aggressive nation willing to start wars, perpetrate torture, and otherwise violate human rights on false pretenses. They think America poses a greater threat to international stability than some of the countries the state department identifies as rogue nations, like North Korea and Iran. \n\n**Him**: That's a bunch of crap, but I can see why they think that. \n\n**Me**: We've spent American moral leadership, the American people's trust in their own government, trillions of dollars, countless Iraqi lives, and thousands of American lives to oust a dictator who had nothing to do with 9/11, and posed no sufficiently grave imminent threat to justify military force on that scale. And we may be in greater danger of WMD attack now than before. It's good we got rid of Saddam. But seriously, the costs outweighed the benefits. \n\n**Him**: Actually, I totally agree. \n\n**Me**: That's an unusual view for a veteran, in my experience. So many seem so reluctant to acknowledge America has ever made a mistake when our troops died. I'm glad we found common ground here.  \n\n**Him**: \"Mistake?\" Now hold on there. I never said *that*.

It went something like this:\n\n**Me**: It is now clear that Iraq never had any WMDs, and had no active WMD program. \n\n**Him**: Well, we don't know. They might have been smuggled out of the country. \n\n**Me**: That's even worse! If true, it means they've gone from where we knew they were to where we don't! Osama bin Laden may have them now! Saddam was evil, but not crazy. He would have never used them to launch an attack on the United States, because that would have been suicide. We don't know that about whoever has them now. We may be in greater danger now than before the war!\n\n**Him**: Interesting point. \n\n**Me**: But WMDs were the whole moral predicate for the war. The American people have never found ousting tyrants alone sufficient cause for putting our troops in harm's way on that scale. To get us to support war, we had to be convinced there was a significant national interest at stake. In this case, the threat of imminent destruction by, in Bush's own words, \"thousands of tons\" of WMDs. \n\n**Him**: Yeah, I know. And I agree with them. We shouldn't put Americans lives at risk unless it's in our own interests to do so. It just doesn't make any sense to spill our own blood and treasure to try to save a world that doesn't want us to save it. \n\n**Me**: Worse, Bush never came out and said Iraq was behind 9/11. But he made sure to say \"Saddam Hussein\" or \"Iraq\" together in close proximity to \"9/11\" in almost every public appearance in the run up to war. That's an old trial lawyer's trick to imply a connection between two matters when they can't come and out say there's a connection because it's not true. It worked. Polling showed huge swaths of the American people--maybe even a majority--believed Saddam Hussein was partly responsible for 9/11. \n\nHim: Yup. What a bunch of bullshit. Hussein had nothing to do with 9/11. Bush all but lied us into war. \n\n**Me**: We've lost much of our foreign policy soft power--power rooted not in military force, but in persuasive appeal arising from moral leadership. Globally, billions of people now regard America as an aggressive nation willing to start wars, perpetrate torture, and otherwise violate human rights on false pretenses. They think America poses a greater threat to international stability than some of the countries the state department identifies as rogue nations, like North Korea and Iran. \n\n**Him**: That's a bunch of crap, but I can see why they think that. \n\n**Me**: We've spent American moral leadership, the American people's trust in their own government, trillions of dollars, countless Iraqi lives, and thousands of American lives to oust a dictator who had nothing to do with 9/11, and posed no sufficiently grave imminent threat to justify military force on that scale. And we may be in greater danger of WMD attack now than before. It's good we got rid of Saddam. But seriously, the costs outweighed the benefits. \n\n**Him**: Actually, I totally agree. \n\n**Me**: That's an unusual view for a veteran, in my experience. So many seem so reluctant to acknowledge America has ever made a mistake when our troops died. I'm glad we found common ground here.  \n\n**Him**: \"Mistake?\" Now hold on there. I never said *that*.

He was deliberately trying to be evasive. Which in a situation of imminent war with a super power, it's probably smarter to just let them look at your shit, even if it hurts your pride to do so. On a quick side note, I once heard it said that he was being evasive, not to trick the Americans, but to trick his own people. They were generally held in check by fear, and if they knew that he didn't have WMD's, they might have revolted. So at the end of the day, I blame the war, partially on Bush, and partially on that ASSHOLE Saddam's jackassery...","duration":"","id":318,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_c8zbhgz","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":317,"links":[316],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"Leksington","label":"Don't let triddy5 fool you.

The US supplied Saddam Hussein with the binary chemical weapons technology for his nerve gas and chemical pre-cursors to make chemical weapons. We prevented UN investigations and ran diplomatic cover for Saddam Hussein as he used those chemical weapons. We gave him more than $1 billion in agricultural credits so Hussein could feed his army as he waged a war of aggression. We gave him satellite intelligence. And we even had our old ally Saddam Hussein reflag his oil tankers and had the US Navy escorting those tankers out of the Persian Gulf so he could have the cash to wage his war.\n\nBut your point is moot for several reasons:\n\n* After the 1991 Gulf War we overran Iraq with UN weapons inspectors who reported that Iraq's nuclear program was completely gone and its chemical program was eviscerated. (After Iraq got fed up with the US illegally using the inspectors to spy, they started dragging their feet on inspections to resist the spying, but we knew they had accomplished their job. Clinton ordered the UN weapons inspectors to leave Iraq.)\n\n* The man in charge of Iraq's WMD military-industrial complex, Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, defected to the US during the 1990s. He told the CIA that he was ordered to comply with the ceasefire by Saddam and to completely destroy the WMD military-industrial complex and that he carried out his orders. (He would later be assassinated by his father-in-law.)\n\n* During 2003 Bush insisted that weapons inspectors be again sent into Iraq. Saddam Hussein agreed and the weapons inspectors went around Iraq with the US directing them and inspected whatever they wanted to, completely unhindered, for *months*. And they found no WMD.\n\nWe knew for a fact Iraq had no WMD. The invasion of Iraq was based on cold, calculated, deliberate lies by the US gov't to wage a war of aggression. Everyone from Colin Powell's aide to the British gov't has confirmed this.\n\nAnd we know the real reason for the war too. As former Fed chair Alan Greenspan from his 2007 book \"The Age of Turbulence: Adventures in a New World\" wrote, \"I'm saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows: The Iraq war is largely about oil.\"\n\nTo ignore these realities is simply to delude one's self.\n\nEdit: Typos.","duration":"","id":445,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_c8z63qb","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":444,"links":[384],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"sir_furt_wigglepants","label":"[While there was no proof there definitely was reasonable suspicion they had the capabilities.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halabja_poison_gas_attack)","duration":"","id":444,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_c8z5h0u","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":384,"links":[0],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"blushing_rouge","label":"In other words, 42% of Americans say it is okay for the US gov't to wage a propaganda campaign of deliberate lies that will slaughter hundreds of thousands of people and cost the country trillions.\n\nOr put yet another way, 42% of Americans are gullible fools with no morals and who advocate criminality.","duration":"","id":384,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c8z3kz8","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4,"level":5,"title":"Ten years and hundreds of thousands of deaths later, with the Bush administration having long conceded there were no WMDs, a new poll finds 42% of Americans still say the Iraq War was \"not a mistake.\"","label":"rantoniob","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_1ant8b","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1363815009,"simScore":0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1363817574,"simScore":0.5969214249082974,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1363823681,"simScore":0.7718997486283439,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1363823681,"simScore":0.7897244218369063,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1363825508,"simScore":0.7645737881698599,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1363825839,"simScore":0.7746916623874789,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1363826347,"simScore":0.815200001001358,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},{"index":192,"links":[0],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"zingo-spleen","label":"I have to post this, just because I want to show that the govt is screwed up, no matter who is in charge...

Oil supply was never severely or irreversibly broken, and economoic stability was not broken due to Iraq's oil. For people who believe this was the true reason for the war, it was \"not a mistake.\"\n\nSome people believe that the war was really about caution and acting without hindsight. Saddam refused to make it clear to the West that he had no WMD's, and actually promoted a false air that they did exist. We now know that this was probably an act to appear stronger, with the goal of intimidating hostile surrounding countries such as Iran. On this front, the war was a mistake, but not one without probable cause.\n\nSome people believe that the war was really just a continuation of the U.S military industrial complex. ON that front, the U.S is still the worlds biggest exporter of military weapons, and the producers of said industry are still reaping massive profits. On that front, the war was not a mistake. \n\nLastly some people believe the war was about bringing freedom and democracy to a dictatorship. We are told that Iraq is a much more open and democratic society post Saddam (won't debate the truth of these statements, but the media has repeatedly stuck to that version).

In reading the water gate wiki page, it became fairly clear that there were very few people in high places who wanted to help cover this up (at least compared to other coverups). This was an infiltration of the democratic party, an entity already in the back pocket of the higher ups, so it I can't see any motive on their part—as far as I can tell, the top guy in Watergate was Nixon (pretty rare). I assumed that maybe, seeing as it didn't involve the CIA or implicate any member of the 'permanent government', that they were just a 'eh, you're on your own bud' kind of thing. But then, in conversing with another poster here, he mentioned that this occurred at the height of Mockingbird, and that it was Washington Post and NYT (the 2 biggest mocking bird players at the time) who jumped on the story. Here's his exact response:\n\n\"So I would argue that Watergate was a calculated political event in 'deep politics'. The establishment lost use of their 'figurehead' and benefited from feeding him to the wolves, essentially. It paved the way for Reagans election in 80, for HW Bush's appointment by ford to director of central intelligence in 76, it purged much of the liberal elements of the republican party (nixon and his posse were pretty liberal outside of his warmongering), it placated the populace who thought they were making a stand against the policies of the last decade.\n\n\"This is interesting: When watergate broke, it was the height of operation mockingbird and the NYT and Washington Post jumped on the story like rabid dogs, both primary mockingbird institutions so there was definitely an agenda with that. One of the writers for WaPo was Carl Bernstein, who immediately after his famous watergate reporting left the WaPo and began investigating the CIAs relationship with the media, so clearly he realized something was up and wanted to learn more about it. He is one of the best resources for what we know about mockingbird today.\"\n\nI have yet to, in my own research, verify much of this (except the parts about mockingbird, WaPo and NYT), but he has yet to steer me wrong so I am inclined to hold this as a place holder of the assumed situation until I get time to look into it further. \n\nI'm told Peter Scott Dale has some good work in this subject (I've read one of his JFK essay and he *really* gets into the nitty gritty—honestly, a little too much so that it makes it hard to see the big picture) for those looking to further understand this information.

If we could just have a logical discussion without the bi-partisan mudslinging we might get somewhere in this country. Thank you.\n\nAs to your question, which is an excellent one, it is perhaps the moral question of our time. We ignore genocide in Africa because, eh, it's Africa, yet when our interests are at play suddenly we take the moral high ground. As an American I find this embarrassing. Either we stand for our values or we don't, we can't just pick and choose which one is convenient or serves our best interests because that makes us worse than hypocrites, it makes us as bad as what we are fighting. Now I understand that we can't just send in troops to every shit hole in the world and in general I think the U.S. does a decent job of intervening where necessary, but we just let North Korea do whatever they want? Where's the concern? They test missiles and openly admit, no, even boast about developing a nuclear weapons program. Clearly the world recognizes this lack of consistency.\n\nIt is a moral dilemma. However, to me at least, and I'm hardly a war hawk, there is one area where military intervention is necessary. That is the absolute destruction of ISIS. We, at the very least, are partially responsible for creating the conditions for this organization to exist, and I believe we should deal with it. Use my tax dollars please. We should allocate every military resource we have to eliminate these criminal murderers, including ground troops, in fact especially ground troops and a lot of them. Air strikes and drones will only hamper and inconvenience their operations. We need to physically control the region indefinitely until some kind of sanity prevails.

Yes, mass executions are absolutely horrifying, yes, massacring people for their religious beliefs is horrifying - but to compare to the Holocaust is not really accurate.  Do you know why they invented the gas chambers?  Because they couldn't shoot people quickly enough.  The final solution created a systematic machine that efficiently collected and transported hundreds of thousands of people from across the length and width of Europe in order to murder them.\n\nI think we can say with little hesitation that nothing like the Holocaust has happened since.

What argument/poisition did I inappropriately attribute to him?\n\nEDIT: here's the quote that prompted my response:\n\n&gt;  Nearly every coalition intelligence service agreed that Hussein had or would soon have WMDs, they just couldn't prove it.\n\nEDIT2: and here's his quote on the second point:\n\n&gt; most countries did not provide many troops relative to the contributions of the US and UK, but you can't ignore the fact that those countries typically do not have the same type of large, ready military force that US/UK have","duration":"","id":84,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_conuuj9","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":83,"links":[82],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"Vhaine","label":"Pretty straw man you got there..","duration":"","id":83,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_conunvn","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":82,"links":[81],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"ChornWork2","label":"Australia for local politics, rewarded with generous visa programs.

They are joined by British forces. Their mission is to attack Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs and its military capacity to threaten its neighbors.\n\n&gt;Their purpose is to protect the national interest of the United States, and indeed the interests of people throughout the Middle East and around the world.\n\n&gt;**Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors or the world with nuclear arms, poison gas or biological weapons.**\n\n&gt;I want to explain why I have decided, with the unanimous recommendation of my national security team, to use force in Iraq; why we have acted now; and what we aim to accomplish.\n\n&gt;Six weeks ago, Saddam Hussein announced that he would no longer cooperate with the United Nations weapons inspectors called UNSCOM. They are highly professional experts from dozens of countries. Their job is to oversee the elimination of Iraq's capability to retain, create and use weapons of mass destruction, and to verify that Iraq does not attempt to rebuild that capability.\n\nRead the entire thing. This is why Bill Clinton has always supported the invasion of Iraq - even if he had critiques like all the other Monday morning generals.\n\nAlso ask your self and others why General Clapper, Obama's head of national security, said that the WMDs were moved into Syria in the run up to the war.\n\nhttp://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-10-29/news/0310290219_1_illicit-weapons-clapper-weapons-inspector\n\n&gt;WASHINGTON — The director of a top U.S. spy agency said Tuesday that he believes that material from Iraq's illicit weapons program had been transported into Syria and perhaps other countries as part of an effort by the Iraqis to disperse and destroy evidence immediately before the recent war.\n\n&gt;The official, James Clapper Jr., a retired lieutenant general, said satellite imagery showing a heavy flow of traffic from Iraq into Syria, just before the U.S. invasion in March, led him to believe that illicit weapons material \"unquestionably\" had been moved out of Iraq.\n\nThat isn't some kook, it's the guy Obama hired to be the director of intelligence in 09!

Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status.

Vaccines are routinely given, for example, even for diseases whose risk of being contracted is much less than 1 percent.\n\n&gt;That being granted, the simplistic doctrine of \"if at least 1 percent, then act\" is especially frightening in international conflicts, not least because the number of threats misconstrued (by someone or other) to meet the 1 percent threshold is huge and the consequences of military action are so terrible and irrevocable.\n\nAnd so you see, with the 1 percent doctrine Cheney has created his defense for how they operated.  Moreover, with this doctrine he has created the response to allegations that he lied.  To you it's a \"lie\" but to him it was being cautious.  And so he would say something like this: \"no, I didn't lie, it's just that you people have the luxury of sitting at home and critiquing what we're doing while we actually have to make difficult decisions about protecting the American people or risk an extraordinarily deadly attack.  And we have to act with imperfect information.  And so it's not a lie if we decide that we can't risk the even 1% possibility that Saddam Hussein has WMD.\"\n\nI am not agreeing with Cheney's logic for how he proceeded.  However, in order for us as a society to move forward on this we do need to stop this stupid back and forth of \"you're a liar and a war criminal, no I'm not, yes you are, no I'm not.\"  And so if we are to have a serious discussion on all of this I think a good place to start is with a substantive discussion of Cheney's 1% doctrine.  We need to discuss what's wrong with this doctrine and how we can better respond to what are sometimes \"unknown\" and \"unknowable\" threats.","duration":"","id":6,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_ct5anda","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5,"level":5,"title":"rhader","label":"There can be no doubt that the Bush administration knowingly deceive the American public into an illegal aggressive invasion of a country.

Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status.

He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members ... It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons.\"\n-- Sen.

matter how much of the material shared on this subreddit you choose to believe, I assume the majority of /r/conspiracy believes that the Bush administration engaged in extensive lies, cover-ups, and manipulation with regards to the Iraq War and the \"War on Terror\".\n\nMy question is why didn't they fake finding evidence of WMDs in Iraq after the US invaded? \n\nFor example, it seems like it would be incredibly easy to fabricate evidence of an Iraqi biological weapons program- just find a Winnebago in the desert, point to some test tubes, and say they tested positive for anthrax. Or hire some Arab dudes in lab coats to say they ran the Iraqi WMD program. Or point some clicking Geiger counters at some machinery and say it's radioactive.  There would be little cost, little risk, and immense political reward for the Bush administration. If they had created credible evidence of a WMD program in Iraq that could pose a legitimate threat to the US, many would consider Bush to be one of the greatest presidents rather than the worst.  Remember, this was also during a vulnerable time in Bush's presidency- he ended up barely winning the 2004 election.  Yet there was none of this, and cooking up this evidence would have been MUCH simpler than many of the other conspiracies found on this page. Foreign policy and Iraq were the main issues in the '04 election, and had that happened Bush would have likely won in a landslide, rather than such a slim margin.\n\nOf course no one here knows the answer for sure, but it is interesting to discuss the LACK of a conspiracy where one could do the job so well.","selftextHTML":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how much of the material shared on this subreddit you choose to believe, I assume the majority of &lt;a href=\"/r/conspiracy\"&gt;/r/conspiracy&lt;/a&gt; believes that the Bush administration engaged in extensive lies, cover-ups, and manipulation with regards to the Iraq War and the &amp;quot;War on Terror&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question is why didn&amp;#39;t they fake finding evidence of WMDs in Iraq after the US invaded? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, it seems like it would be incredibly easy to fabricate evidence of an Iraqi biological weapons program- just find a Winnebago in the desert, point to some test tubes, and say they tested positive for anthrax.

Foreign policy and Iraq were the main issues in the &amp;#39;04 election, and had that happened Bush would have likely won in a landslide, rather than such a slim margin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course no one here knows the answer for sure, but it is interesting to discuss the LACK of a conspiracy where one could do the job so well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","domain":"self.conspiracy","gilded":0,"commentCount":38,"score":38,"upVotes":38,"downVotes":0,"created":1377501659,"createdUTC":1377472859,"visited":false,"self":false,"saved":false,"edited":false,"stickied":false,"nsfw":false,"hidden":false,"clicked":false,"users":["eveverything","veloximide","Eveverything","veloximide","sovereignman","Eveverything","sovereignman","cojoco","Eveverything","cojoco","mattgrimes","swansong19","kondon","Nerd_Destroyer","Eveverything","backtotheuniverse","muckraker2","benjamindees","animalfarmpig","mattgrimes","paperzplz","mattgrimes","paperzplz","mageant","paperzplz","kaydpea","epiphanot","jakenichols","estamio2","choppymo","fortfive","necronomiconomics","Eveverything","mothereffingteresa","tradias","shockaDee"],"kind":"t3","identifier":"1l2zrl","fullName":"t3_1l2zrl"},{"user":{"username":"hellovn100","modhash":"n19vgkbtc7ce7fef46d39bfe9574aea4f04846c8a3eff81bd1","cookie":"43916988,2015-11-22T15:31:57,a702abca429f136617e3a30c99a6ec04058ec183","password":"111111"},"wikis":["cheney"],"url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJCPcYCupY&amp;list=FLXs_ZDPCfcciK0QfnYUu21w&amp;index=1","commentContent":"","permalink":"/r/conspiracy/comments/1nb11u/wmd_lies_bush_cheney_rumsfeld_the_ultimate_clip/?ref=search_posts","author":"knacker_farts","title":"WMD LIES - Bush Cheney Rumsfeld - THE ULTIMATE CLIP , How did they get away with this ?","subreddit":"conspiracy","subredditId":"t5_2qh4r","thumbnail":"http://f.thumbs.redditmedia.com/K4Lpqni0LEfeeIle.jpg","selftext":"","domain":"youtube.com","gilded":0,"commentCount":82,"score":453,"upVotes":453,"downVotes":0,"created":1380394435,"createdUTC":1380365635,"visited":false,"self":false,"saved":false,"edited":false,"stickied":false,"nsfw":false,"hidden":false,"clicked":false,"users":["knacker_farts","thumpernm","reddelicious77","letsownthenwo","armstrony","poot11235","seanbastard1","random_usernames","seanbastard1","sweetgeebus","myopus","Sonmi-452","apropo","ianp23","blakeb43","sonmi-452","apropo","sonmi-452","apropo","sonmi-452","tommytickturd","ooogaooogayoink","knacker_farts","TheWiredWorld","CHIEF_HANDS_IN_PANTS","knacker_farts","april_fabb","thetallgiant","amature-hour","magnetoelectric","caulds","bobomatrix","thewiredworld","kencole54321","thewiredworld","ndimoro","indocilis","tubbstosterone","OoogaOoogaYoink","tripelt","beyond_repair","warname","TodaysIllusion","gnugamer","rillo561","justcs","infiniterelease","dat-bass","fiverrah","basement_duhweller","mfajma","reputable_opinion"],"kind":"t3","identifier":"1nb11u","fullName":"t3_1nb11u"},{"user":{"username":"hellovn100","modhash":"n19vgkbtc7ce7fef46d39bfe9574aea4f04846c8a3eff81bd1","cookie":"43916988,2015-11-22T15:31:57,a702abca429f136617e3a30c99a6ec04058ec183","password":"111111"},"wikis":["wmds","iraq"],"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/28rodo/was_clinton_the_first_to_link_wmds_and_alqueda_to/","commentContent":"","permalink":"/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/28rodo/was_clinton_the_first_to_link_wmds_and_alqueda_to/?ref=search_posts","author":"PoliticalMPA","title":"Was Clinton the first to link WMDs and Al-Queda to Iraq?","subreddit":"PoliticalDiscussion","subredditId":"t5_2sfmf","thumbnail":"","selftext":"http://tomnichols.net/blog/2014/06/21/who-started-that-story-about-iraq-wmds-and-al-qaeda-thats-right-bill-clinton/\n\nI have some reservations with this blog post. It relies on off handed quotes to say that Clinton linked Iraq to Al-Queda. I really do not believe it provides evidence for the claims laid out here. The Bill Richardson quote is really not enough evidence for me. I can not find the transcript, but it appears to be taken out of context. From what I can gather Richardson is indirectly linking Iraq to Al-Queda through Sudan. If a President wanted to link Al-Queda to Iraq it would make more sense to just go out themselves and say it directly in a prime time speech. Here its the ambassador to the UN making a somewhat longer than necessary comment on CNN. \n\nIn the blog it also seems 1998 Iraq is being compared to 2003 Iraq. I feel the missile attack that severely damaged Iraqi infrastructure and the pre 2003 inspections are glossed over. Those to peices of evidence make Bush's claims of WMD's a lot less credible than Clinton's.
