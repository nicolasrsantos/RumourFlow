This is for anyone who refuses to register for nytimes.com and is ignorant of bugmenot:\n\nThe New York Times\n\nOctober 13, 2008\nThe Man Behind the Whispers About Obama\nBy JIM RUTENBERG\n\nThe most persistent falsehood about Senator Barack Obama’s background first hit in 2004 just two weeks after the Democratic convention speech that helped set him on the path to his presidential candidacy: “Obama is a Muslim who has concealed his religion.”\n\nThat statement, contained in a press release, spun a complex tale about the ancestry of Mr. Obama, who is Christian.\n\nThe press release was picked up by a conservative Web site, FreeRepublic.com, and spread steadily as others elaborated on its claims over the years in e-mail messages, Web sites and books. It continues to drive other false rumors about Mr. Obama’s background.\n\nJust last Friday, a woman told Senator John McCain at a town-hall-style meeting, “I have read about him,” and “he’s an Arab.” Mr. McCain corrected her.\n\nUntil this month, the man who is widely credited with starting the cyberwhisper campaign that still dogs Mr. Obama was a secondary character in news reports, with deep explorations of his background largely confined to liberal blogs.\n\nBut an appearance in a documentary-style program on the Fox News Channel watched by three million people last week thrust the man, Andy Martin, and his past into the foreground. The program allowed Mr. Martin to assert falsely and without challenge that Mr. Obama had once trained to overthrow the government.\n\nAn examination of legal documents and election filings, along with interviews with his acquaintances, revealed Mr. Martin, 62, to be a man with a history of scintillating if not always factual claims. He has left a trail of animosity — some of it provoked by anti-Jewish comments — among political leaders, lawyers and judges in three states over more than 30 years.\n\nHe is a law school graduate, but his admission to the Illinois bar was blocked in the 1970s after a psychiatric finding of “moderately severe character defect manifested by well-documented ideation with a paranoid flavor and a grandiose character.”\n\nThough he is not a lawyer, Mr. Martin went on to become a prodigious filer of lawsuits, and he made unsuccessful attempts to win public office for both parties in three states, as well as for president at least twice, in 1988 and 2000. Based in Chicago, he now identifies himself as a writer who focuses on his anti-Obama Web site and press releases.\n\nMr. Martin, in a series of interviews, did not dispute his influence in Obama rumors.\n\n“Everybody uses my research as a takeoff point,” Mr. Martin said, adding, however, that some take his writings “and exaggerate them to suit their own fantasies.”\n\nAs for his background, he said: “I’m a colorful person. There’s always somebody who has a legitimate cause in their mind to be angry with me.”\n\nWhen questions were raised last week about Mr. Martin’s appearance and claims on “Hannity’s America” on Fox News, the program’s producer said Mr. Martin was clearly expressing his opinion and not necessarily fact.\n\nIt was not Mr. Martin\u0027s first turn on national television. The CBS News program \"48 Hours\" in 1993 devoted an hourlong program, \"See You in Court; Civil War, Anthony Martin Clogs Legal System with Frivolous Lawsuits,\" to what it called his prolific filings. (Mr. Martin has also be known as Anthony Martin-Trigona.) He has filed so many lawsuits that a judge barred him from doing so in any federal court without preliminary approval.\n\nHe prepared to run as a Democrat for Congress in Connecticut, where paperwork for one of his campaign committees listed as one purpose “to exterminate Jew power.” He ran as a Republican for the Florida State Senate and the United States Senate in Illinois. When running for president in 1999, he aired a television advertisement in New Hampshire that accused George W. Bush of using cocaine.\n\nIn the 1990s, Mr. Martin was jailed in a case in Florida involving a physical altercation.\n\nHis newfound prominence, and the persistence of his line of political attack — updated regularly on his Web site and through press releases — amazes those from his past.\n\n“Well, that’s just a bookend for me,” said Tom Slade, a former chairman of the Florida Republican Party, whom Mr. Martin sued for refusing to support him. Mr. Slade said Mr. Martin was driven like “a run-over dog, but he’s fearless.”\n\nGiven Mr. Obama’s unusual background, which was the focus of his first book, it was perhaps bound to become fodder for some opposed to his candidacy.\n\nMr. Obama was raised mostly by his white mother, an atheist, and his grandparents, who were Protestant, in Hawaii. He hardly knew his father, a Kenyan from a Muslim family who variously considered himself atheist or agnostic, Mr. Obama wrote. For a few childhood years, Mr. Obama lived in Indonesia with a stepfather he described as loosely following a liberal Islam.\n\nTheories about Mr. Obama’s background have taken on a life of their own. But independent analysts seeking the origins of the cyberspace attacks wind up at Mr. Martin’s first press release, posted on the Free Republic Web site in August 2004.\n\nIts general outlines have turned up in a host of works that have expounded falsely on Mr. Obama’s heritage or supposed attempts to conceal it, including “Obama Nation,” the widely discredited best seller about Mr. Obama by Jerome R. Corsi. Mr. Corsi opens the book with a quote from Mr. Martin.\n\n“What he’s generating gets picked up in other places,” said Danielle Allen, a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University who has investigated the e-mail campaign’s circulation and origins, “and it’s an example of how the Internet has given power to sources we would have never taken seriously at another point in time.”\n\nMs. Allen said Mr. Martin’s original work found amplification in 2006, when a man named Ted Sampley wrote an article painting Mr. Obama as a secret practitioner of Islam. Quoting liberally from Mr. Martin, the article circulated on the Internet, and its contents eventually found their way into various e-mail messages, particularly an added claim that Mr. Obama had attended “Jakarta’s Muslim Wahhabi schools. Wahhabism is the radical teaching that created the Muslim terrorists who are now waging jihad on the rest of the world.”\n\nMr. Obama for two years attended a Catholic school in Indonesia, where he was taught about the Bible, he wrote in “Dreams From My Father,” and for two years went to an Indonesian public school open to all religions, where he was taught about the Koran.\n\nMr. Sampley, coincidentally, is a Vietnam veteran and longtime opponent of Mr. McCain and Senator John Kerry, both of whom he accused of ignoring his claims that American prisoners were left behind in Vietnam. He previously portrayed Mr. McCain as a “Manchurian candidate.” Speaking of Mr. Martin’s influence on his Obama writings, Mr. Sampley said, “I keyed off of his work.”\n\nMr. Martin’s depictions of Mr. Obama as a secret Muslim have found resonance among some Jewish voters who have received e-mail messages containing various versions of his initial theory, often by new authors and with new twists.\n\nIn his original press release, Mr. Martin wrote that he was personally “a strong supporter of the Muslim community.” But, he wrote of Mr. Obama, “it may well be that his concealment is meant to endanger Israel.” He added, “His Muslim religion would obviously raise serious questions in many Jewish circles.”\n\nYet in various court papers, Mr. Martin had impugned Jews.\n\nA motion he filed in a 1983 bankruptcy case called the judge “a crooked, slimy Jew who has a history of lying and thieving common to members of his race.”\n\nIn another motion, filed in 1983, Mr. Martin wrote, “I am able to understand how the Holocaust took place, and with every passing day feel less and less sorry that it did.”\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Martin denied some statements against Jews attributed to him in court papers, blaming malicious judges for inserting them.\n\nBut in his “48 Hours” interview in 1993, he affirmed a different anti-Semitic part of the affidavit that included the line about the Holocaust, saying, “The record speaks for itself.”\n\nWhen asked Friday about an assertion in his court papers that “Jews, historically and in daily living, act through clans and in wolf pack syndrome,” he said, “That one sort of rings a bell.”\n\nHe said he was not anti-Semitic. “I was trying to show that everybody in the bankruptcy court was Jewish and I was not Jewish,” he said, “and I was being victimized by religious bias.”\n\nIn discussing the denial of his admission to the Illinois bar, Mr. Martin said the psychiatric exam listing him as having a “moderately severe personality defect” was spitefully written by an evaluator he had clashed with.\n\nMr. Martin, who says he is from a well-off banking and farming family, is clearly pleased with his newfound attention. But, he said, others have added to his work in “scary” ways.\n\n“They Google ‘Islam’ and ‘Obama’ and my stuff comes up and they take that and kind of use that — like a Christmas tree, and they decorate it,” he said. For instance, he said, he did not necessarily ascribe to a widely circulated e-mail message from the Israeli right-wing activist Ruth Matar, which includes the false assertion, “If Obama were elected, he would be the first Arab-American president.”\n\nHe said he had at least come to “accept” Mr. Obama’s word that he had found Jesus Christ. His intent, he said, was only to educate.\n\nKitty Bennett contributed reporting.\n\nCopyright 2008 The New York Times Company","duration":"","id":69,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c05u51i","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Obama\u0027s a Muslim?

The tired, discredited post-9/11 \"war on terror\" slogans will be dumped.\n..continued here http://www.rense.com/general82/obm.htm\n\nThis jives perfectly with Biden calling for a draft and a New World Order:\n\nhttp://100777.com/node/1291\n\nTHE United States would \"have to face\" a painful dilemma on restoring the military draft as rising casualties saw the number of volunteers dry up, a senator warned today.\n\nJoseph Biden, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, made the prediction after new data released by the Pentagon showed the US Army failing to meet its recruitment targets for four straight months.\n\n\"We\u0027re going to have to face that question,\" he said on NBC\u0027s Meet the Press TV show when asked if it was realistic to expect restoration of the draft.\n\n\"The truth of the matter is, it is going to become a subject, if, in fact, there\u0027s a 40 per cent shortfall in recruitment. It\u0027s just a reality,\" he said.\n\nAlso see \"How I Learned To Love The New World Order\" article by Biden.\n\nObama advisors:\n-Zbigniew Brzezinski- U.S-led hegemony...control of Eurasia by any means neccessary...probably war with Russia\n-Anthony Lake- Supported invasions of Haiti, IMF/World Bank supporter, UNICEF, in Govt since 1962\n-Susan Rice- Brookings Institute, Rhodes Scholar, UNICEF, CFR..\"use globalization to bring down U.S\"\n-Richard Clarke- You know him.\n-Gen. Merrill McPeak- Planned Operation Desert Storm, supports various foreign occupations\n-Dennis Ross- MAJOR Israeli supporter, policy planner for both Bushes and Clinton.","duration":"","id":92,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c05u27v","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Obama\u0027s a Muslim?
