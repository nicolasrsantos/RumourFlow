It's 6 in 25, not 1 in 4, jezzz, learn to math.
This Time Poll also says 61% of Americans do not want the ground zero mosque.   Do you agree with that part of the poll, or just the part that serves your biases? 
So you can only take this poll in two ways, all valid or none of it valid, which way is it?  And don't give me the false dichotomy crap, it's either one or the other.
You do understand that the "something" is an opinion.

Also, you can't answer my question because either way you end up looking like a twat.
I imagine you as a screaming child.
