Even when a poll is not explicitly a push poll, political operations still use carefully worded polls to reshape an issue.  Op is right, polls like this one that ask ridiculous questions are frequently used to legitimize discourse that is beyond the pale.\n\nedit: I would add though that most often polls like this are used simply to provide salacious fodder for the evening news and the bias is more towards salaciousness than towards one party or the other ","duration":"","id":8,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c40llwp","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"The Problem With Polls About Whether Obama Is a Muslim - By asking voters what they think about the president\u0027s religion, pollsters help to perpetuate a falsehood.","label":"drjulianbashir","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_quj3b","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.331676288E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.331686817E9,"simScore":0.740113364812842,"sentiment":"  Positive"},"timestamp":1.331695451E9,"simScore":0.6956415851707763,"sentiment":"  Positive"},{"index":11,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"livefreeord13","label":"athiest, Christan,Mormon,scientologist list goes on i don\u0027t care really as long as the job gets done and the economy managed.

A survey (or in this case a poll) is like a conversation. By providing certain response categories you prime participants into thinking about specific answers. If I ask you how many times you\u0027ve done drugs and the only answers are \"a few times\" \"all the time\" \"every day\" you\u0027re going to get nonsense if you\u0027re asking people that might not use drugs. In a similar manner, if you ask people what is the presidents religious affiliation \"christian\" \"atheist\" \"muslim\" just by random chance you\u0027re going to get 33% of the people writing atheist.
