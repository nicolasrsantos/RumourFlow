The Daily Show might do a better job than r/politics.
I think the real argument along those lines (which I don't buy into, for the record) is that the second amendment applies only to the weapons used by the militia--a specific, standard issue rifle. These days, it'd be an M4. 
Yeah. Anybody whose sole objection to Mr. Romney is his religion is not paying attention or a bigot. 

Dismissing Republicans as idiots... that one, I'm not so sure about. I think there are plenty of people out there who identify as Republicans and are intelligent and rational. They're just not the ones in Congress--the ones playing the game of obstruction for the last few years. This strategy might help get more Republicans elected if they can blame the president for inaction, but acting so irresponsibly during a time of national crisis is *fucking idiotic.*
No argument there. 
You....you really think someone would do that? Be an idiot? On the Internet? 
It probably shouldn't be the most important issue, but if you only hear arguments in favor from people who smoke daily, you're not listening.
