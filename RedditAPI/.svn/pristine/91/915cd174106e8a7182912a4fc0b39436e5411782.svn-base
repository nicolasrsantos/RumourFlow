He pretends he did, as in this speech from 2002:\r\n\r\n\"It is clear that in the 4 years since the UNSCOM inspectors were forced out, Saddam Hussein has continued his quest for weapons of mass destruction. According to intelligence, Iraq has chemical and biological weapons as well as missiles with ranges in excess of the 150 kilometer restriction imposed by the United Nations in the ceasefire resolution. Although Iraq\u0027s chemical weapons capability was reduced during the UNSCOM inspections, Iraq has maintained its chemical weapons effort over the last 4 years. Evidence suggests that it has begun renewed production of chemical warfare agents, probably including mustard gas, sarin, cyclosarin, and VX. Intelligence reports show that Iraq has invested more heavily in its biological weapons programs over the 4 years, with the result that all key aspects of this program--R\u0026amp;D, production and weaponization--are active. Most elements of the program are larger and more advanced than they were before the gulf war. Iraq has some lethal and incapacitating agents and is capable of quickly producing and weaponizing a variety of such agents, including anthrax, for delivery on a range of vehicles such as bombs, missiles, aerial sprayers, and covert operatives which could bring them to the United States homeland. Since inspectors left, the Iraqi regime has energized its missile program, probably now consisting of a few dozen Scud-type missiles with ranges of 650 to 900 kilometers that could hit Israel, Saudi Arabia and other U.S. allies in the region. In addition, Iraq is developing unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs, capable of delivering chemical and biological warfare agents, which could threaten Iraq\u0027s neighbors as well as American forces in the Persian Gulf.\"\r\n\r\n-John Kerry, 9-Oct-2002","duration":"","id":21,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_c4ybw","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":20,"links":[19],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"TheCookieMonster","label":"Kerry didn\u0027t have access to the WMD intelligence so it\u0027s a stretch to say he lied about it.\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s hard to tell if they never thought to look beyond the picture coming out of the Whitehouse (or the US Media that was similiarly unquestioning), or whether they thought their best chance for re-election was to just run with it all.

According to intelligence, Iraq has chemical and biological weapons as well as missiles with ranges in excess of the 150 kilometer restriction imposed by the United Nations in the ceasefire resolution. Although Iraq\u0027s chemical weapons capability was reduced during the UNSCOM inspections, Iraq has maintained its chemical weapons effort over the last 4 years. Evidence suggests that it has begun renewed production of chemical warfare agents, probably including mustard gas, sarin, cyclosarin, and VX. Intelligence reports show that Iraq has invested more heavily in its biological weapons programs over the 4 years, with the result that all key aspects of this program--R\u0026amp;D, production and weaponization--are active. Most elements of the program are larger and more advanced than they were before the gulf war. Iraq has some lethal and incapacitating agents and is capable of quickly producing and weaponizing a variety of such agents, including anthrax, for delivery on a range of vehicles such as bombs, missiles, aerial sprayers, and covert operatives which could bring them to the United States homeland. Since inspectors left, the Iraqi regime has energized its missile program, probably now consisting of a few dozen Scud-type missiles with ranges of 650 to 900 kilometers that could hit Israel, Saudi Arabia and other U.S. allies in the region. In addition, Iraq is developing unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs, capable of delivering chemical and biological warfare agents, which could threaten Iraq\u0027s neighbors as well as American forces in the Persian Gulf.\"\r\n\r\n-John Kerry, 9-Oct-2002","duration":"","id":21,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_c4ybw","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":20,"links":[19],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"TheCookieMonster","label":"Kerry didn\u0027t have access to the WMD intelligence so it\u0027s a stretch to say he lied about it.\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s hard to tell if they never thought to look beyond the picture coming out of the Whitehouse (or the US Media that was similiarly unquestioning), or whether they thought their best chance for re-election was to just run with it all.
