Poll finds 23% of Texans are idiots.
I will upwardly revise my poll results.
Unfortunately, not so if you make a distinction between "idiots" and "morons."
I think the "Obama is a Muslim" storyline is a stand-in for something else. People are put off by the fact that he's different, but they are afraid to say it's because he's black or half-Kenyan.

It's not socially acceptable to say you won't vote for Obama because he's black. So you say you won't vote for him because he's a Muslim, since it's (somewhat) socially acceptable to say.

That's why people continue to insist that they believe he's a Muslim even if they're shown evidence to the contrary.
I think you've hit it on the head. In polite company, people won't say they won't vote for Barack because he's black. So they say it's because he's a Muslim, instead.

Some people want to believe he's a Muslim because it makes them feel less guilty about not liking him because he's black.
