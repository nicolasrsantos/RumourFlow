In the FIRST Presidential visit to Malaysia in almost 50 years the POTUS said the PSI was his \"first priority\" for the trip.

This thread, like so many others, is just more obfuscation meant to reinforce the official story. The aircraft was never in the Southern Indian Ocean and will never be proven to exist there. A cover-up of this magnitude requires reinforcement by teams of on-line misinformers charged with suppressing the truth by introducing thousands of pages of online drivel. We all know who they are.","duration":"","id":38,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqo6r2n","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"If there had been no pings...","label":"boeing797-300er","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_33sxg0","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.429979854E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.429995596E9,"simScore":0.7132111091630327,"sentiment":"  Negative"}],"userNodes":[],"links":[{"source":1,"target":0,"weight":0.8195131913293153},{"source":2,"target":0,"weight":0.8260536403034838},{"source":3,"target":2,"weight":0.5472692618788124},{"source":4,"target":3,"weight":0.6246298233244033},{"source":5,"target":4,"weight":0.6837448642114667},{"source":6,"target":5,"weight":0.742317464817309},{"source":7,"target":6,"weight":0.7523623997491062},{"source":8,"target":7,"weight":0.8919749730604898},{"source":9,"target":8,"weight":0.702732638200676},{"source":10,"target":0,"weight":0.6590381926960416},{"source":11,"target":10,"weight":0.8066874966025352},{"source":12,"target":11,"weight":0.736266366427853},{"source":13,"target":11,"weight":0.810348213384194},{"source":14,"target":13,"weight":0.8111339254796014},{"source":15,"target":14,"weight":0.740709376294827},{"source":16,"target":13,"weight":0.7988571354321071},{"source":17,"target":10,"weight":0.6253318734777471},{"source":18,"target":17,"weight":0.7072038180791602},{"source":19,"target":18,"weight":0.5492392853966781},{"source":20,"target":18,"weight":0.7953759872665008},{"source":21,"target":0,"weight":0.7159535811247305},{"source":22,"target":0,"weight":0.7259300691217201},{"source":23,"target":0,"weight":0.7028926432308935},{"source":24,"target":0,"weight":0.7497499948367476},{"source":25,"target":0,"weight":0.7984479179916283},{"source":26,"target":0,"weight":0.8288349348669632},{"source":27,"target":26,"weight":0.75672649165504},{"source":28,"target":0,"weight":0.7863541595223877},{"source":29,"target":28,"weight":0.6461281491104852},{"source":30,"target":29,"weight":0.6900085103556965},{"source":31,"target":0,"weight":0.5531611080798838},{"source":32,"target":31,"weight":0.7907354167973002},{"source":33,"target":0,"weight":0.7619047619047619},{"source":34,"target":0,"weight":0.46153846153846156},{"source":35,"target":34,"weight":0.687443323867645},{"source":36,"target":34,"weight":0.5923608867350446},{"source":37,"target":36,"weight":0.6968419922666267},{"source":38,"target":0,"weight":0.7132111091630327}],"userLinks":[],"submissions":[{"user":{"username":"hellovn10","modhash":"km4yyogyc0cee90895369cdb11ff5eb2bb4cc5142468a852ef","cookie":"43980466,2015-11-21T05:39:53,f732f43dfb503cf98dfae9f7c07bab91ca22cf9e","password":"111111"},"wikis":[],"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MH370/comments/33sxg0/if_there_had_been_no_pings/","permalink":"/r/MH370/comments/33sxg0/if_there_had_been_no_pings/?ref\u003dsearch_posts","author":"Boeing797-300ER","title":"If there had been no pings...","subreddit":"MH370","subredditId":"t5_30v0f","thumbnail":"","selftext":"Imagine if the perpetrator of this crime (I am 99% sure that this incident was initiated by a human/humans), had disabled SATCOM at IGARI.
