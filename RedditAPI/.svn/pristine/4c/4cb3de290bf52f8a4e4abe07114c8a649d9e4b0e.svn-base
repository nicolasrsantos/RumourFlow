You\u0027re not just sitting down for a drink with a regular Joe unless you\u0027re on the campaign trail or looking for good publicity. You\u0027re the Commander in Chief of the most powerful country in the world and if you got there on \u0027likability\u0027 rather than tangible solutions to extremely difficult world issues you\u0027re probably going to end up like Bush did. \n\nAnd Bush was always a puppet in that regime. He had 3/4 of his dad\u0027s advisors on staff and the plan all along was to let those folks get another shot at it. \n\nDoes that make Dubya a dumb guy? Hell no. At the end of the day he was a Yale-educated public servant (although with gentleman\u0027s Cs iirc) who had success as a Governor of one of nation\u0027s largest states. That isn\u0027t easy. His failure was in that he never should have been in Federal office as it didn\u0027t play to his strengths post-election and highlighted his weaknesses. He was an awful ambassador abroad because he had spent far too much time in his rich, white, protestant, boys club and had an embarrassing lack of cultural perspective as a result. \n\nAnd that\u0027s just a tiny portion of what caused the demise of his presidency/approval ratings without delving in to policy.

People just don\u0027t seem to care. Or rather, they care but they think someone else is going to take care of it. Our voter turn outs are horrendous, which I know isn\u0027t unique, but it\u0027s really sort of depressing. We\u0027re handing these people our futures and they\u0027re destroying our country. Did you know Canada used to have over a million bodies of fresh water that were protected by the Government? Now we have about a hundred and fifty. Meanwhile people have been protesting companies like Nestle draining our aquifers. CSIS is as scarey as the NSA but if you try and talk to the average Canadian about it they look at you as if you\u0027re a nut job. We have a form of patriotism in Canada that isn\u0027t that different than America\u0027s. We often tend to act like we\u0027re better than Americans though, not like, out right or in your face about it, but rather looking down on them condescendingly, like oh, silly Americants... We\u0027re so quick to judge their corruption, and we\u0027re so proud to be Canadian, that we never look at ourselves. Our patriotism is definitely a bit more toned down than America\u0027s, but it\u0027s incredibly similar and I\u0027d even say more widespread. There are a lot of Americans waking up and realizing that their country is being sold off to the rich, in Canada we realize this is happening, but we blame America, or rather we don\u0027t focus on our own issues. We feel that it\u0027s global issues effecting us rather than our own Government failing us. I mean hey, It\u0027s both, but so many Canadians are really blind to it.\n\n","duration":"","id":513,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_cuafulb","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":512,"links":[511],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Slimshaydena","label":"Yeah I thought I had read something along those lines.\n\nI actually live in New Zealand, and our government is heading the same way as yours.

As if Americans actually have a choice in the matter concerning which corporate-funded puppet will eschew X or Y Agenda.\n\n“Fascism should more appropriately be called Corporatism because it is a merger of state and corporate power.”- Benito Mussolini\n\nThe K-12 education system is an idoctrination system of partnership, or collusion on the behalf to the individual, to maintain the system.\n\nMedia is utilized As A Weapon for shaping thoughts against/into/upon The People.\n\nIf this were a democracy, I highly doubt political power would be passed around so gaily between families with established lordships over the populace.\n\nAmerica is comprised of a nation of slaves, who think they\u0027re free, because that\u0027s what they\u0027ve been told.\n\nSure, it\u0027s not as dismal as North Korea, and we have more Human Rights than China. But still... True Liberty is Without Bounds. It\u0027s not continuously assaulted against. It\u0027s not being spied on by your own government. It\u0027s not falling prey to fear-mongering, instituted as a weapon- by the government- against The People... as \"a reason\" to successively strip away Constitutional Liberties from The People.\n\nWe require: A Reformation.\n\nSnowden should be pardoned by The U.S. President. Julian Assange should be granted Political Asylum and Honorary Citizenship.\n\nIf The U.S. States were a Free Nation, and not a Tyrannical-Fascist Power, it\u0027d CELEBRATE people who gave up Their Entire Lives, for the sake of Defending Liberty... not just their own, but our\u0027s, as well.\n\nAccording to Mussolini\u0027s definition of Fascism, America is already a Fascist State. The advantage of controlling the media is that you can make the ignorant believe whatever you want them to believe.\n\nEducation. The Challenging of Ideas. Critical Thinking. These are the factors that will turn the tide in the next century for America.\n\nBeware of the promises of Socialism and Bigger Government.\n\n\"A society that aims for equality before liberty, will end up with neither equality nor liberty. And a society that aims first for Liberty will not end up with equality, but it\u0027ll end up with a closer approach to equality, than any other kind of system that has ever been developed... You can only aim at equality by giving some people a right to take things from others. And what ultimately happens when you aim at equality is that \u0027A\u0027 and \u0027B\u0027 decide what \u0027C\u0027 shall do for \u0027D\u0027- except that they take a little bit of a commission off of on the way.\"- Friedman\n\nLIBERTY, First!\n\nTrust none of these corporate-sponsored whores!

Me being her boyfriend I was top on the detective\u0027s interview list.  As the investigation progressed, they pulled up every facebook conversation, text message, email, etc... They even found a hand written letter I had given her around Christmas time.  We had arguments just like any other couple and I\u0027m very sarcastic so it\u0027s easy to take some text out of context if you don\u0027t know me.  A few months later when the reward for her killer was raised to $200,000 the detectives started getting desperate trying to find a lead.  They scrutinized and interrogated so many things that I would consider \"innocent\" that I began to get really scared that they may try to \"pin\" the whole thing on me.  So yeah people that think \"well if you\u0027re innocent then you should have nothing to hide\" are being extremely naive.  Looked at in another way, I was just living my life trying to do the right things like any other decent human being and then I found myself being scrutinized by law enforcement  who can interpreter data very differently than it\u0027s original intention.  All because SOMEONE ELSE committed a crime.
