It was also obvious to anyone with the most rudimentary knowledge of Middle Eastern politics that the country would collapse into chaos and civil war and become a haven for terrorists as soon as the multitude of simmering ethnic tensions were released from Saddam\u0027s strong-arm tactics.\n\nWorldwide, tens of millions of people marched against the war, including hundreds of thousands in the United States. Unfortunately, they were largely ignored by the mainstream media in the US, and people in smaller protests (including many of my friends) were routinely threatened and harassed by supporters of the war. \n\nIt was a really ugly and unpleasant period to be a liberal - the only time in my life I\u0027ve ever felt physically afraid to express my opinions in mixed company, and even online thanks to what were at the time only rumors of government surveillance.

Was it always sentiment you felt strongly about, or did you grow into it? Did you voice this discontent openly, or have you only felt comfortable/ interested in speaking about it relatively recently? Did you hear someone else say something similar which made you think about it in a new light, or did you come to the conclusion yourself?\n\nI find it interesting that I\u0027m seeing so many people lately expressing this sentiment, when it previously seemed a little taboo or unspoken. Obviously there is still a lot of lingering resentment over the Bush presidency that was swept under the rug when Obama came into office, so I\u0027m not surprised it spilled over when Jeb started campaigning. I wouldn\u0027t have expected it to manifest quite the way it has....  but it\u0027s certainly interesting now to see how a guy like Trump is tapping into that reservoir of emotions for campaign ammo.\n\nEdit: Why does everyone think I\u0027m asking about the Iraq War, or broader Bush-era shit?

Do you mean from a national or international perspective? From a domestic perspective it was voted upon in Congress and authorized. \n\nFrom an international perspective, it\u0027s more complicated. The UN said it was an illegal war, not that means that war crimes were committed. However, in adopting resolution 1441 they ultimately made it legal on an international level. The International Criminal Court is the only court that can bring war crimes charges/judgements. The ICC\u0027s jurisdiction pertains to member states OR requests directly from the Security Council from the UN. The United States has never ratified joining the ICC and has veto power on the Security Council, so no decision will ever be brought against it. \n\nAlso agreed with above, a war crime isn\u0027t a premediated decision to go to war or even deceive your country. It is the acts carried out during war, and it is a very high bar that needs to be met. Not saying if Bush\u0027s or Obama\u0027s administration did or did not commit war crimes.\n\nAnd then of course you need an international community willing and able to stand up to the USA.. and that is unlikely.   \n","duration":"","id":498,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cw42gyq","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":492,"links":[462],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"PaterBinks","label":"But aren\u0027t there such things as legal and illegal wars?

We are not bound by the ICC, and I don\u0027t think we\u0027re bound by the ICJ either. I firmly stand behind the idea that the second gulf war was started with good intentions, but muddled because of a mismanagement of resources after Saddam was taken out of power. The war was not started because of oil, or because the US has a need for an enemy, as some people have claimed. George W Bush wanted his legacy to be that of a humanitarian. Look at what he did in Darfur. He was one of the first people in the world to call Darfur a genocide. Look at the work he did starting PEPFAR. I truly believe Bush thought he was doing the right thing by toppling a despotic dictator, who had used chemical weapons on his own people, and he oppressed the Sunni, Shia, and Kurds, running a minority Ba\u0027ath government.

And by that point near everyone agreed that we never had any business having gone there in the first place.  \n\nYet, here you are.  \n\nDon\u0027t you find it odd that NATO wouldn\u0027t back our invasion?  That for the 5 years since NATOs action against them that there had been little no news, much less talk/reason to invade again?  That it very suddenly went from an almost non-issue to full scale war?  That the entire rest of the world was calling us out on our bullshit?  Literally hating americans?  Fuck, we _still_ can\u0027t travel abroad safely.  Many people pretend to be canadians, to not deal with the backlash against the US.  All of which started with this retarded vendetta held by Bush Jr on behalf of his daddy.  \n\nWe had _zero_ reason for going there.  We did vastly more damage than good.  You want to talk about destabilization?  The region is much more unstable now, because of our trying to play big brother.
