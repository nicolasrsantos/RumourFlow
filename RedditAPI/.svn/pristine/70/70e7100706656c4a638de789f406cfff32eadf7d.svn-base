His name starts with an **S**. If he **hides** long enough in a bush he says a special voice line. He is a good counter to **assassins** due to his kit. And he is usually played in the jungle (**J**).\n\n* Skarner has received a gameplay update not so long ago. He only has 2 skins (Earthrune and Sandscourge) so he fullfill the Second clue.

Yup. Skarner. ([Lore](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Skarner/Background)).\n\nHe is one of the Brackern, an ancient race that was awaken with the events narrated in the Journal of Justice. What if the Ascension files are the ascension of other Brackerns as some sort of event that involves Skarner in some way?\n\n*****\n\n**TL;DR**: Skarner fullfills Morello\u0027s tweet, the leak in the korean site and has few skins. I think that there is something going on the works for the Crystal Scar (Ascension Files) a possible event and it will come with a new Skarner ultimate skin (he is from that map after all).\n\nWhat do you guys think?","selftextHTML":"\u0026lt;!-- SC_OFF --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div class\u003d\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hi guys.
