I get what you\u0027re trying to say, but it\u0027s not right.\n\n\u0026gt;Secondly, Obama is not a socialist. \n\nYou can call Obama\u0027s actions socialist without him being a socialist.  You didn\u0027t post the actual e-mails so I don\u0027t know what they said, so if they called him an outright socialist then that is incorrect.\n\n\u0026gt;Thirdly, he has been verified to have been born in the United States through birth records.\n\nYes, anyone who tries to play the birth-certificate card is an idiot.  You\u0027re spot-on there.\n\n\u0026gt;Bigoted and ignorant republicans grasping at straws to have \"dirt\" on the guy because they don\u0027t like a black Democrat in office.\n\nErm... assuming the only reason they don\u0027t like him because he\u0027s black is pretty much grasping at straws.  It\u0027s a conclusion that has no basis in reality or fact, and you\u0027re only making it because it allows you to trivialize their position (which is what they were doing to make you so mad).  The minute you say that, all of your credibility goes out the window.  You didn\u0027t have to put that statement in to make your point, and by including it you substantially weaken your stance.\n\n\u0026gt;They forget or, rather, dismiss the fact that George W. Bush was in office when the economy went down the tubes. \n\nThat\u0027s not how economics works.\n\n\u0026gt;Not to mention the $950,000,000,000 cost of unnecessary wars.  Oh, but health care is too expensive.\n\nThose are Obama\u0027s words though.  Obama and the Democrats are the ones who couldn\u0027t get together to pass the health care bill.  Obama is continuing the wars but not pushing single payer because it\u0027s too expensive.  You\u0027re not making sense.\n\n\u0026gt;Where were all the right wing protesters and tea parties then?\n\nOK, where are all the Democrat protesters against the wars now?  Surely if war was wrong under Bush it\u0027s wrong under Obama.\n\n\u0026gt;Oh, that\u0027s right, W was a white republican...no need to complain.\n\nAgain, that\u0027s just completely stupid.  You\u0027re just trying to trivialize your opponent.  Unfortunately for you, that only works with like-minded people who agree that you can simply ignore someone if you don\u0027t like what they say.  When you sent this to people who *don\u0027t* agree with you (which you did), then all they have to do is prove you wrong (very easy with statements like that) and your point falls apart.\n\n\u0026gt;I don\u0027t consider myself a Republican nor a Democrat, but it\u0027s clear from my view that the extreme-right Republicans have lost their minds.\n\nTrue!  Unfortunately, this is the first time you mentioned the \u0027extreme\u0027 right.  If you had amended your previous spout of written diarrhea with that qualifier, it would be much more accurate and much less stupid.  However you didn\u0027t.\n\nLook, there\u0027s nothing wrong with arguing with people, especially people who say stupid things like your letter mentions.  However, you did a really poor job of it, and most of those arguments will only fly in reddit-like circlejerk situations.  In the real world, you just sound like the people you\u0027re arguing against.","duration":"","id":39,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c0iahzh","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Tired Of All The \"Obama Hate\" E-mail Fowards, So I Replied To ALL...","label":"pixelmagic","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_am3rx","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.262787926E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.262792365E9,"simScore":0.7494792673450662,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.262795334E9,"simScore":0.7828298796243894,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.262795334E9,"simScore":0.6366564260882853,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.262799865E9,"simScore":0.6925037135695895,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.262811945E9,"simScore":0.7768810632155541,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.262827624E9,"simScore":0.6495324286820249,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.262830285E9,"simScore":0.6827468643625567,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.26284236E9,"simScore":0.5988316820106849,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":47,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"reditis4niggers","label":"Born in a muslim country([according to his grandmother](http://www.wnd.com/index.php?pageId\u003d78931)), a *proven* socialist (**HELLO!

It was clearly circulated among the right-wing Obama hating e-mail circles common these days, hence the very skewed negative results.  I will concede that Obama is not perfect, he has some improvements to make for sure, but the right hate him almost as much as Satan himself.  All the nonsense calling him Muslim, socialist, and questioning his birth in the US, just shows that the right has lost their minds. Firstly, Obama is not a Muslim, [Source](http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/muslim.asp) but even if he was, who cares? Separation of church and state, and all. Perhaps we should have an atheist president, so there won\u0027t be any silly arguments over religion.  Secondly, Obama is not a socialist. [Source](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/13/AR2009031301899.html) Thirdly, he has been verified to have been born in the United States through birth records.[Source](http://www.city-data.com/forum/attachments/2008-presidential-election/21432d1213364575-obama-s-birth-certificate-bo_birthcert.jpg)  So why has all this nonsense spread? Bigoted and ignorant republicans grasping at straws to have \"dirt\" on the guy because they don\u0027t like a black Democrat in office.\n\nThey forget or, rather, dismiss the fact that George W. Bush was in office when the economy went down the tubes. Not to mention the $950,000,000,000 cost of unnecessary wars. Oh, but health care is too expensive. We can\u0027t spend money to help our own people, but we\u0027ve got loads of money to go kill people in other countries.  Where were all the right wing protesters and tea parties then? Funny since George W. Bush was one of the worst presidents of all time.  Oh,  that\u0027s right, W was a white republican...no need to complain.\n\nThe Obama hate by the right is really out of control.  I don\u0027t consider myself a Republican nor a Democrat, but it\u0027s clear from my view that the extreme-right Republicans have lost their minds. Feel free to forward this to whoever you wish. :) ","selftextHTML":"\u0026lt;!-- SC_OFF --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div class\u003d\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So my aunt forwards me one of those right-wing Obama hate machine e-mails, and I finally had enough.  Here is the poll see forwarded me so that all her right wing friends could make Obama look bad in a pointless online poll...\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://js.polls.yahoo.com/quiz/quiziframe.php?poll_id\u003d46067\"\u0026gt;Obama Poll\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So I replied as follows...\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The results of this poll are hilarious.  It was clearly circulated among the right-wing Obama hating e-mail circles common these days, hence the very skewed negative results.  I will concede that Obama is not perfect, he has some improvements to make for sure, but the right hate him almost as much as Satan himself.  All the nonsense calling him Muslim, socialist, and questioning his birth in the US, just shows that the right has lost their minds. Firstly, Obama is not a Muslim, \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/muslim.asp\"\u0026gt;Source\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; but even if he was, who cares? Separation of church and state, and all. Perhaps we should have an atheist president, so there won\u0026amp;#39;t be any silly arguments over religion.  Secondly, Obama is not a socialist. \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/13/AR2009031301899.html\"\u0026gt;Source\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Thirdly, he has been verified to have been born in the United States through birth records.\u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://www.city-data.com/forum/attachments/2008-presidential-election/21432d1213364575-obama-s-birth-certificate-bo_birthcert.jpg\"\u0026gt;Source\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;  So why has all this nonsense spread? Bigoted and ignorant republicans grasping at straws to have \u0026amp;quot;dirt\u0026amp;quot; on the guy because they don\u0026amp;#39;t like a black Democrat in office.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;They forget or, rather, dismiss the fact that George W. Bush was in office when the economy went down the tubes. Not to mention the $950,000,000,000 cost of unnecessary wars. Oh, but health care is too expensive. We can\u0026amp;#39;t spend money to help our own people, but we\u0026amp;#39;ve got loads of money to go kill people in other countries.
