I do not understand how anyone can really believe this.  Hard work and Salary are COMPLETELY UNRELATED in capitalist economies.  The degree of skill and rarity of the skill is the primary factor that determines how much money you make.  There are people who work very hard, but because they are farmers, or got married/had children too early, or never had a chance to really go to school, or live in places where there is no reasonable higher education, or are too old, or crippled, they are poor.  And we need social programs to provide health care, and food, and heating oil and other things because capitalism itself does not provide them with a means to earn a decent living, even if they work 12 hour days!\n\nCapitalist economics depends, demands, requires inequality across the board to function properly.  The system requires that there be poor people and rich people for proper functioning.  Sure there are freeloaders, people who game the system, etc, but that will be true regardless of the system, and you can\u0027t punish good, hardworking people because a few rednecks and criminals abuse these programs.  So screw you for not supporting social programs.\n\nAs for Iraq, go ahead and ask the 500,000 dead Iraqi civilians whether they are grateful for the removal of their dictator.  Besides which, we replaced a dictator with just another police state, this one nominally \"democratic\" but actually is quite authoritarian and extremely corrupt.  They beat, arrest, coerce, and torture their citizens just as much as Saddam did so we didn\u0027t really save them from anything.\n\nAs for your ridiculous assertion that we aren\u0027t bombing more people because we are giving out food stamp assistance, it would take 50 years of food stamp spending equal the obscene amount we spent murdering Iraqis.","duration":"","id":56,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_c8zbq66","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":51,"links":[38],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"mmpeleg","label":"I do not support social programs because it takes money from people who work hard for it and give it to people that don\u0027t try at all (this isn\u0027t true for everyone).

The American people have never found ousting tyrants alone sufficient cause for putting our troops in harm\u0027s way on that scale. To get us to support war, we had to be convinced there was a significant national interest at stake. In this case, the threat of imminent destruction by, in Bush\u0027s own words, \"thousands of tons\" of WMDs. \n\n**Him**: Yeah, I know. And I agree with them.

Globally, billions of people now regard America as an aggressive nation willing to start wars, perpetrate torture, and otherwise violate human rights on false pretenses. They think America poses a greater threat to international stability than some of the countries the state department identifies as rogue nations, like North Korea and Iran. \n\n**Him**: That\u0027s a bunch of crap, but I can see why they think that. \n\n**Me**: We\u0027ve spent American moral leadership, the American people\u0027s trust in their own government, trillions of dollars, countless Iraqi lives, and thousands of American lives to oust a dictator who had nothing to do with 9/11, and posed no sufficiently grave imminent threat to justify military force on that scale. And we may be in greater danger of WMD attack now than before. It\u0027s good we got rid of Saddam. But seriously, the costs outweighed the benefits. \n\n**Him**: Actually, I totally agree. \n\n**Me**: That\u0027s an unusual view for a veteran, in my experience.

The two questions are entirely separate.  To put it another way, the War with Iraq wasn\u0027t a mistake, even if there were no WMDs, because we had plenty of other good reasons to go to war, starting with the fact that Saddam was a brutal dictator.  WMDs were not the sole justification for the war.\n\nSecondarily, and this is a point Hillary tried to make back during the campaign, even if you consider WMDs the sole justification, the question hinges on the meaning of the word \"mistake\".  If I eat something, and I have every reason to believe it\u0027s fine, and it turns out it was poisoned, did I make a \"mistake\" in eating it?  In the ultimate sense, perhaps.  But given that I made the most reasonable decision available at the time with the knowledge available, it wasn\u0027t a \"mistake\" in the sense that I made a bad choice.  It just turned out my choice was not optimal.  To suggest otherwise is to suggest that sometimes it\u0027s *right* to make choices *that have no rationale*, because there\u0027s a slim chance they might be right after all based on something you don\u0027t know.

You do put some of your memories as facts of events, but if you did not mean it as such then disregard my reply. Otherwise take it as how someone who was strongly against war saw it back in the day, and still does.\n\n\u0026gt; I remember that Hussein had violated like 14 UN resolutions or something like that\n\nIn the years Saddam was in office, when he did many of his worst violations, he was strongly supported by the US. Through the period there were also at least 18 severe resolutions against Turkey. Mostly against the escalation of the war on its Kurdish population and the conflict in Cyprus, on the form \"Reiterates call for a substantial reduction of foreign troops and reduction in military spending\". These arms came from us. Clinton sent more arms to Turkey during this time, in fact in \u002797 alone he sent more arms to turkey than we did throughout the entire Cold War despite they being our most strategically important ally. Well I should not say despite, because we did arm them a lot even then.\n\nThe only country we provided with more military aid was Israel. 26 strong resolutions against during that period, on the form \"Calls on the government of Israel to cease, on an urgent basis, the establishment, construction, and planning of settlements in the Arab territories, occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem\" and \"Reiterated calls on Israel to abide by the Fourth Geneva Convention\", you know, the one that is supposed to protect civilians in war zones.\n\nThis goes on through the list of US allies, like Indonesia during the rape of East Timor et c. But there are of course others. Obvious examples are Morocco and West Sahara, which is never talked about here since it\u0027s not ours, rather it\u0027s \"France\u0027s Palestine\". 18 resolutions against by the way, of the usual type - allow UN peacekeeping forces and military inspections, cease breaking international humanitarian laws et c.\n\n\u0026gt; he had kicked out weapons inspectors\n\nNo, there were inspections throughout the period between the two us invasions. In 2002 Iraq even accepted that the inspectors should be completely unfettered, that is having no restrictions imposed on them under Iraqi or other law or rule. This was proposed for international nuclear arms inspectors by Soviet during the Cold War, instantly rejected by USA obviously.\n\n\u0026gt; and had pursued development of a nuclear program.\n\nSweden has a nuclear program too. As does most seriously industrialised countries. Armenia developed it during that period, when there were several UN resolutions against them. They had invaded Azerbaijan, principally because more than 80% of the Armenian foreign trade lines was through a part of that country. A bit like Kuwait mostly blocking Iraq from the Persian Gulf. (Ok, I know I\u0027m pushing it here.)\n\nBy the way, it was George Bush the first who brought Iraqi nuclear engineers and physicists to USA to train them. It\u0027s like Kissinger\u0027s remark - in 1975 he pushes for development of nuclear power in Iran, so that they can export all their oil and prosper, and besides oil is not as reliable and sustainable. And now he says that Iran would not pursue a nuclear program for energy purposes, since they have so much oil, so it must be a stepping stone for nuclear arms. When called out on this radical departure by the Washington Post he replied, I think very candidly, that \"they were an ally back then\". \n\n\u0026gt;  Even Clinton had bombed him to let the inspectors back in 1998.\n\nYou have this backwards. The inspectors left in 1998, because US/UK said that they would bomb Iraq. Which they did for four days shortly after the inspectors had withdrawn. Then the inspectors went back in.\n\nThis was held as one of those \"well the inspectors testimony can\u0027t be fully accounted for because they don\u0027t know what naughty business Saddam was up to during those days when they weren\u0027t there/we were bombing\". Similarly the 2003 US invasion of Iraq meant that UN forces guarding weapon sites in Iraq had to leave, which is why the sites could be looted by unknown interests.\n\n\u0026gt;  At the time I felt we were far more justified by those blatant violations of international goodwill\n\nThis is how propaganda works.\n\nAbout international goodwill, do you mean the bombings, or the brutal sanctions (referred to by the UN humanitarian co-ordinators as \"genocidal\") which only hurt the people of Iraq and in many ways gave Saddam leverage on power.\n\n\u0026gt; So the lack of WMD\u0027s wasn\u0027t really a big deal.\n\nHere we agree.\n\n\u0026gt; a popular-led ouster of Saddam without us could have been just as bloody as it was with us. \n\nBetween the two invasions a group of generals that was planning to rebel against Saddam came to the US asking for permission to use captured Iraqi equipment against Saddam. This was denied and the US told Saddam about the coup, and they were rebels no more.\n\nIt\u0027s impossible to say how it would have turned out, but it\u0027s generally believed that it would have had decent popular support. Compared to a foreign invasion this seems reasonable, wouldn\u0027t you agree?","duration":"","id":331,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_c8zqcjo","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":303,"links":[302],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"medieval_pants","label":"I mean, sure.

No, I am not saying nations are free to do what they want but \"US put Saddam there in the first place\" is an entirely pointless thing to say at the end of the day.","duration":"","id":550,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_c8z5uaq","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":533,"links":[482],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Zoshchenko","label":"You realize the US is who put Saddam Hussein in power in the first place, right?\n\nApart from that, why are we not invading Syria or North Korea or several African countries?

Sorry!).\n\nI contradicted myself by saying that the Iraq war was less deaths per year but then went to say as a result of the war later in the comment (its unedited if you wish to look at it again). My argument is that a despot was in power, he was a very bad guy. I don\u0027t think anyone can disagree. It was in our interest as well as in a humanitarian interest to get rid of Saddam. In the end Iraq is significantly more stable and seems to be going in the right direction as a result of the war (including post war years). Sorry about that.\n\nThe U.S. has had numerous successes in this regard (though some failures, to). South Korea and Japan being the best examples with Vietnam being the worst - though I personally wouldn\u0027t compare the Vietnam situation to Korea and Japan. I think Iraq has a less promising future than these 2 countries (Japan had the pacifism movement, and Korea had a very clear and real enemy to be the opposite of) I still think it has a good shot to not fall back to total despotism, at least not nearly as bad as Saddam. And *that* is why I agree with the war.\n\nIn the end it comes down to this question - which you may answer differently than I. Would Iraq ever improve or have a shot without someone doing something about Saddam or even more broadly it\u0027s political trajectory that was reliable enough to gamble on?

What we have a problem with is that the things that you talk about are sold as the main reasons for the wars. The simple truth is that the main reason for the Iraq war is profit for private companies that go as far as installing their Chairman\u0027s into government (Cheney) to make it happen for them. It is an intentionally manufactured conflict in the name of profiteering. If the reasons that you are saying are the reasons for the war then, logically, we would be at war with all the countries I mentioned but we aren\u0027t are we? It is the hypocrisy and lies that are disgusting and an army of people like yourself that just can\u0027t seem to follow a simple money trail to figure it out.

This allowed Bin Laden to evade capture, and kept his influence in the AfPak region strong for a while longer.\n\nSo ... \"Yay for Bin Laden\", I guess.\n\nLots of people had lots of reasons for Iraq, and I disagree with most.  Seems to me Bush\u0027s **personal** reason for following NeoCon orders and invading Iraq was obvious:\n\nBush didn\u0027t think he could capture or kill Osama Bin Laden.  He was already talking about how \"the hunt for Osama Bin Laden is no longer an important goal\" (sour grapes from the President who looked impotent).  This new prioritizing happened right about the time he was stoking the Iraq run-up.  So he looked around and thought he found a war he could \u0027win\u0027.\n\nCompared to Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein was an easy strike - a typical despot with a few high profile palaces, rather than a little bug that wriggles under rocks when you chase him.  Hussein had a country with finite borders in which to look. A country we\u0027d invaded before, and a country with people eager to hand Hussein over.\n\nHe wanted a severed head to hold up in front of everyone, and he didn\u0027t want to have to wait too long or work too hard for it.\n\nIt all fits into the profile of a person who has had his daddy cover for him all his life, then had his daddy hand him the resources to become President.  Then as President he took more time off in his first year (right up until 9/11) than **any** other modern President.  Before 9/11 embarrassed him into action, he was the \"vacationing President\", who openly regarded his office as a part-time job.  I recall him stating in a pre-9/11 interview that he also tried not to work on weekends *as President*.\n\ntl;dr:  Bush pulled our forces away from Bin Laden, and aimed them towards Hussein because of the George Bush, Jr. unofficial motto:  \"If things get too hard, go find something to do that looks easier\"","duration":"","id":609,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_c8z7fue","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":482,"links":[481],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"jibrish","label":"Conservative here and I thought you\u0027d want the other side of the coin.\n\nMany of us think going to war itself wasn\u0027t a mistake (though obviously mistakes happened before and during the war).

The cold war ended and Bush Sr. set the precedent that to be able to use force against another nation there should be a UN resolution authorising it. So if you\u0027re going to say Libya was a UN operation then the first Iraq war was also a UN operation.\n\nThis was where the whole WMD bullshit came from. They wanted to get a UN resolution authorising force for the second Iraq war. It didn\u0027t work, so they tried to claim they were going in because of previous violations of UN resolutions by Iraq in the past. It was flimsy and no one bought it.\n\nObama has simply brought foreign policy back to Bush Sr\u0027s doctrine.\n\nDon\u0027t think this is something to do with political parties either. Bush Senior, a Republican, was the champion of going through the UN. Clinton, a Democrat, did not go through the UN when he went into Bosnia. He claimed that NATO support was good enough. This opened the way for W. Bush to use similar flimsy excuses to go into Iraq.\n\nWith Libya, Obama caught a break. Russia did not oppose and so he was able to get the UN stamp of approval.
