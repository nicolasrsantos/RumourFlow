Our supply of things like MREs for emergencies was pretty tiny. \n\nMedical care? Yes, there are a handful of doctors/nurses/corpsman, but again, limited medical supplies, and the ship itself had very spartan medical facilities compared to a hospital.

No. You\u0027re not getting power off the ship. Carriers can dock in precious few places, and all of our power generation capacity was permanently installed. \n\nWater? Sure.. We got that one covered. We could make 250k gallons a day, and if we were put on water hours and weren\u0027t conducting flight ops, we could spare a majority of that(though not all, since all the reactors, and many ships systems, ran off of steam and needed constant makeup water). \n\nBoats? Again, only a handful of small inflatable hull boats, and the captains gig. 5ish? You\u0027re not doing a lot with that.\n\nCan they respond to an emergency? Sure. But they are warships, not relief ships, and can at best put out a token response. Its better than nothing, but its still a singularly inefficient relief vessel.

That should be what the military is used for: To assert a local and limited sovereignty in war torn areas where the question of the sovereign controlling government are unsettled, in the event that local innocent populations stand to suffer the hells of war.\n\nWe did exactly right defending Northern Iraq, our only mission in Syria should have been the defense of innocent civilians who want no part of the struggle for legitimate rule.\n\nOur military shouldn\u0027t be taking sides in local or regional struggles for sovereignty. Our nation is founded on the idea that people have the right to manifest their own governments, or deconstruct them at gunpoint if they so desire. It\u0027s funny how quickly we dismiss the ideas upon which our very own governments legitimacy is founded when it\u0027s convenient. Because we don\u0027t like the political structure or proposed national religion, we can ignore those people\u0027s right to coalesce their own governments. Our military should stick to doing good by defending people not engaged in struggles concerning the nature and control of their governments. Civil wars are for the most part, civil affairs.\n\nIt\u0027s not our business to like ISIS or not like ISIS. We should issue a general warning to Americans that travel in regions in which ISIS represents a legitimate challenge to the sovereignty of the local government, and as a result Americans are in danger of finding themselves under the rule of a hostile government (which likely would be far less hostile if we weren\u0027t actively trying to stop them from achieving power or form their own state). \n\nOther than defending the loss of innocent populations not engaged in the struggle, it\u0027s not our business to determine which group will rule a given territory or what type of government they intend to institute on the other side of the world. \n\nA war for the creation of a state, fought by a military that is not overwhelmingly rejected by the people, is an issue for the entities whose sovereignty is being challenged, and if they can\u0027t resist, they aren\u0027t sovereign. It is not \"trouble in the world\", it is merely being characterized as such.\n\nAs far as ISIS and the alleged danger they represent is concerned, we should deal with that when they achieve sovereignty. Primarily, set up borders, public services, diplomatic relations, and so on. At which point, we can denounce their ideological governance as we see fit, respond to any threat they may present to the west, and explain to them the consequences of attacks on the west will be the reduction of their governmental infrastructure to rubble. The idea being presented, that ISIS will fight a bloody drawn out war in order to institute an Islamic state, only to immediately scuttle that state by waging open warfare on the west, is the most ridiculous propaganda I\u0027ve ever heard, and Americans should be ashamed for swallowing it. ISIS is far more dangerous as a rag tag militia with nothing to lose fighting for the chance at power. If they struggle for 2-4 years, institute a state, establish and defend borders, and create a government, we\u0027ll have a much greater chance of convincing them to practice peaceful global relations. Those in power do not want to have it taken away, especially if they bought it with their own blood. They\u0027ll carefully and logically consider their actions and the ramifications thereof, or all of their work and blood will have been for nothing.\n\nWhat we\u0027re doing now is not in line with the values we\u0027re supposed to defend, it\u0027s the same old shit we\u0027ve been failing at for decades, and it\u0027s beginning to be clear that the motive is absolutely instability in the Middle East, and not peace and legitimate government. That\u0027s bad, and it\u0027s wrong, and Americans should not be supporting a government that operates on motives outside the people\u0027s will, as that is not a legal government.\n\nObama is being disingenuous here. He\u0027s being braggadocio about controlling the political destiny of nations and regions for those who live in them, when he\u0027s supposed to be supporting those people\u0027s right to make that decision **for themselves**. \n\nIt appears Obama believes he knows what\u0027s best for the Middle East, and he\u0027s going to straighten this mess out and make them do what he says is best, whether they like it or not. It\u0027s kind of understandable how ISIS is so effectively sweeping up control of vast swaths of territory when you look at it through those eyes.\n","duration":"","id":136,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_ckvupxr","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":2,"links":[1],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"darthqueeg","label":"Strangely, the US Military is also one of the most effective humanitarian forces in the world.

It\u0027s true that the US is indeed indispensable and it is true that only the US can send fleets of aircraft carriers to a disaster area and it is true that the US leads from the front in those areas but to pretend like this is something that the US government does not because they have the money (and they want to project a show of military force) but because of some special conscientious element deep down inside every American so unique that it can be used as a distinguishing factor of Americans among other peoples is a bit steep. That\u0027s not to say anyone is more generous than anyone else - US contributions to Haiti were huge because it was much closer to home - same with the Philippines with it being a US colony/dependency/territory of some kind. France\u0027s contribution to Haiti was also massive with it being a former French colony whereas its contribution to the Indonesian earthquake was much less. Again it was much closer to home. People give for various very personal reasons not based on special national character traits. \n\nI know he probably doesn\u0027t really mean it like that but that\u0027s how it comes across to anyone not persuaded by the whole /r/MURICA type political propaganda campaigns that most US presidents have to unfortunately embark on before they are considered electable. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_response_to_the_2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake#Pledged_amounts_as_percentages_of_GDP","duration":"","id":226,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_ckw1tw4","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":217,"links":[1],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"drboomkin","label":"US GDP: 16.8 trillion.\n\nChina: 9.2 trillion.\n\nRussia: 2.09 trillion.\n\nOf course everyone are calling for US assistance.

From [this New York Times article published on April 23, 1999](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/23/news/23iht-nato.2.t_22.html) that was titled \u0027Serbian Leader Said to Accept UN Presence : Air Strikes Destroy Milosevic\u0027s Villa\u0027:\n\n\u0026gt;  In the most audacious blow yet against the Yugoslav leadership, NATO missiles destroyed one of President Slobodan Milosevic\u0027s two official residences in Belgrade on Thursday, even as the alliance stepped up its pressure by announcing a review of contingency plans for a ground invasion. \n\n\u0026gt; The Pentagon justified the attack the Milosevic residence, in the exclusive Dedinje residential area of Belgrade, as an attempt to cut off \"the head\" of a government that has waged a merciless assault on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, forcing hundreds of thousands to flee.\n\n\u0026gt; It said the house was a suspected \"presidential command center\" for the military and police forces in Kosovo. Mr. Milosevic and his family were not in the villa and no deaths or injuries were reported. \n\n\u0026gt; Assassination of foreign leaders is barred by U.S. law. Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said that NATO was not targeting \"Milosevic or the Serb people,\" but, instead, \"the military and the military infrastructure that supports the instruments of oppression in Kosovo.\" \n\nSo the US claimed they weren\u0027t trying to assassinate him in that attack, but it certainly seems suspicious since that\u0027s exactly how the US admittedly tried to assassinate Saddam Hussein in the first Gulf War (trying to blow him up at one of his palaces).\n\n[This article from 1998](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/iraq/keyplayers/saddam021598.htm) talks about previous US attempts of assassinating Saddam Hussein in 1991. It also states that the US will target buildings rather than individuals (officially) to get around the technicality of not purposefully trying to assassinate leaders of other countries, rather they would be collateral damage of the targeted building. It also gives some foreshadowing of what some people in the military and CIA desired but were being blocked by Clinton\u0027s administration (but were clearly able to do a few years later under a different administration):\n\n\u0026gt; Although supporters of tougher military action against Iraq than the bombing strikes proposed by the Clinton administration have publicly avoided calling for President Saddam Hussein\u0027s assassination, his death is an implicit aim behind many demands for stronger U.S. steps, including support of a coup, that would remove him from power.","duration":"","id":273,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_ckvxhy2","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":271,"links":[270],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Gogo01","label":"Saddam Hussein in 1991?\n\nSlobodan Milosevic in 1999?\n\nI can\u0027t speak for Hussein in \u002791, but USA didn\u0027t try to assassinate Milosevic in 1999.","duration":"","id":271,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_ckvvbr3","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":270,"links":[269],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"NoseDragon","label":"A list of attempted (sometimes successful) assassinations.\n\nThat list is mostly made up of complete assholes who pretty much had it coming.\n\nI know that Che Guevara is very popular amongst high school and college kids, but the dude was a piece of shit and was responsible for a large number of executions all over communist Latin America.","duration":"","id":270,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_ckvul6v","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":269,"links":[232],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Minxie","label":"What exactly is this a list of?\n","duration":"","id":269,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_ckvsso8","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":232,"links":[1],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"terranortex","label":"It\u0027s not really surprising that people are skeptical with such a track record. \n\n1949 - Kim Koo, Korean opposition leader\n\n1950s - CIA/Neo-Nazi hit list of more than 200 political figures in West Germany to be “put out of the way” in the event of a Soviet invasion\n\n1950s - Chou En-lai, Prime minister of China, several attempts on his life\n\n1950s, 1962 - Sukarno, President of Indonesia\n\n1951 - Kim Il Sung, Premier of North Korea\n\n1953 - Mohammed Mossadegh, Prime Minister of Iran\n\n1950s (mid) - Claro M.

From [this New York Times article published on April 23, 1999](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/23/news/23iht-nato.2.t_22.html) that was titled \u0027Serbian Leader Said to Accept UN Presence : Air Strikes Destroy Milosevic\u0027s Villa\u0027:\n\n\u0026gt;  In the most audacious blow yet against the Yugoslav leadership, NATO missiles destroyed one of President Slobodan Milosevic\u0027s two official residences in Belgrade on Thursday, even as the alliance stepped up its pressure by announcing a review of contingency plans for a ground invasion. \n\n\u0026gt; The Pentagon justified the attack the Milosevic residence, in the exclusive Dedinje residential area of Belgrade, as an attempt to cut off \"the head\" of a government that has waged a merciless assault on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, forcing hundreds of thousands to flee.\n\n\u0026gt; It said the house was a suspected \"presidential command center\" for the military and police forces in Kosovo. Mr. Milosevic and his family were not in the villa and no deaths or injuries were reported. \n\n\u0026gt; Assassination of foreign leaders is barred by U.S. law. Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said that NATO was not targeting \"Milosevic or the Serb people,\" but, instead, \"the military and the military infrastructure that supports the instruments of oppression in Kosovo.\" \n\nSo the US claimed they weren\u0027t trying to assassinate him in that attack, but it certainly seems suspicious since that\u0027s exactly how the US admittedly tried to assassinate Saddam Hussein in the first Gulf War (trying to blow him up at one of his palaces).\n\n[This article from 1998](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/iraq/keyplayers/saddam021598.htm) talks about previous US attempts of assassinating Saddam Hussein in 1991. It also states that the US will target buildings rather than individuals (officially) to get around the technicality of not purposefully trying to assassinate leaders of other countries, rather they would be collateral damage of the targeted building. It also gives some foreshadowing of what some people in the military and CIA desired but were being blocked by Clinton\u0027s administration (but were clearly able to do a few years later under a different administration):\n\n\u0026gt; Although supporters of tougher military action against Iraq than the bombing strikes proposed by the Clinton administration have publicly avoided calling for President Saddam Hussein\u0027s assassination, his death is an implicit aim behind many demands for stronger U.S. steps, including support of a coup, that would remove him from power.","duration":"","id":273,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_ckvxhy2","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":271,"links":[270],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Gogo01","label":"Saddam Hussein in 1991?\n\nSlobodan Milosevic in 1999?\n\nI can\u0027t speak for Hussein in \u002791, but USA didn\u0027t try to assassinate Milosevic in 1999.","duration":"","id":271,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_ckvvbr3","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":270,"links":[269],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"NoseDragon","label":"A list of attempted (sometimes successful) assassinations.\n\nThat list is mostly made up of complete assholes who pretty much had it coming.\n\nI know that Che Guevara is very popular amongst high school and college kids, but the dude was a piece of shit and was responsible for a large number of executions all over communist Latin America.","duration":"","id":270,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_ckvul6v","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":269,"links":[232],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Minxie","label":"What exactly is this a list of?\n","duration":"","id":269,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_ckvsso8","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":232,"links":[1],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"terranortex","label":"It\u0027s not really surprising that people are skeptical with such a track record. \n\n1949 - Kim Koo, Korean opposition leader\n\n1950s - CIA/Neo-Nazi hit list of more than 200 political figures in West Germany to be “put out of the way” in the event of a Soviet invasion\n\n1950s - Chou En-lai, Prime minister of China, several attempts on his life\n\n1950s, 1962 - Sukarno, President of Indonesia\n\n1951 - Kim Il Sung, Premier of North Korea\n\n1953 - Mohammed Mossadegh, Prime Minister of Iran\n\n1950s (mid) - Claro M.

It was also founded in Novgorod by a Rus Viking -- a Norseman, not a Slav. He did however forge a Norse-Slav civilisation of course.\n\n I don\u0027t get the Ukrainian nationalist arguments of \u0027Ukraine was before Russia\u0027. I studied history on a bachelor\u0027s level in the US and what I learned here reflects what is a fact, not what is a Russian or Ukrainian propaganda. Tsarist Russia was a direct successor state to Kievan Rus. After the Mongol Invasion Ukraine no longer had a central government or a unifying authority. \n\nThe Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth occupied most of those lands. Nomads and Russians occupied the others. At that time Russians and Ukrainians were one people, although after the Mongol Invasion they slowly drifted apart. I speak Ukrainian, Russian and English, but my knowledge of Ukrainian allows me to understand Polish somewhat. It\u0027s a language that\u0027s a mix of Russian and Polish with some archaic words thrown in. \n\n\u0026gt;If I\u0027m not mistaken, it was Kiev that conquered part of Crimea \n\nKievan Rus never conquered Crimea. They had one town that controlled the Sea of Azov strait in the far eastern edge of the peninsula. Eastern Romans had a much more sizeable claim in Chersonesos and its hinterlands, but it was still only a small fraction. I studied history of Antiquity, so this isn\u0027t exactly my specialty, but I\u0027ve taken Eastern Euro and Russian history courses as well. \n\n\u0026gt;The Russians today are the only invaders because they are the only ones that carried out an invasion.\n\n*Russia* is an invader today. It carried out an illegal invasion of it. However, *Russians* have lived in Crimea since the 1700s and have been the majority population there by a very large margin. Under current international customs, that\u0027s the main thing that matters -- anything that happened more than a hundred years ago is generally taken as a new status quo. Russians had a right in Crimea to separate under UN right of self-determination, but Ukraine repeatedly denied the right to do so. \n\nPutin is a brutal megalomaniac autocrat who seized his chance, and he performed the action illegally. However, Ukraine would not allow a legal separatist movement, any more than Russia would -- though Russia did recognise separatism before after a war, see the granting of Independence to Chechnya after first Chechen war.

Same with the rest of the P5.\n\nWhat surprises me most is that most Americans seem to be unaware that in the last 3 decades the US vetoed more resolutions than the rest of the P5 combined during the same period.\n\n\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/UNSC_veto.svg/350px-UNSC_veto.svg.png\n\n\nSo, instead complaining that the SC is a toothless organisation, more people should be asking the US to stop preventing it from doing its job.","duration":"","id":659,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_ckvwdvo","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":534,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"igonjukja","label":"I wish they would call the UN instead.

Everything could have been better off if the overthrow would have been done without the Nazi\u0027s that today gained so much popularity though their Propaganda and for the West closing its eyes on all the Actions they do. Euromaidan still has not been investigated properly and everyone made its conclusions, only Germans and Austrians are the ones in West really questioning the overthrow.\n\nPlus allowing a country who has extreme 2 different views like in Ukraine, allowing after just current overthrow that was made through hate and anger, a war, is just as same them killing those civilians.\n\nEurope should have stepped up, and really take actions in their own hands. Today we see all causalities that are been caused by Ukrainian Army, innocent people killed, tortured and raped for just their different views.\n\nI was really disappointed after this conflict by whole Europe, only true human Interests showed Austria and Left wings of Europe.\n\nAs about Russia, Putin has been warning even before Yanukovich was removed. Action in Crimea I thought a bit extreme, but after seeing what happened in Donetsk really made me question if that would have happened to Crimea too, as I am sure Crimea would have had stand off as well. That Russia is sending troops there, somehow its not right but as well, would u let those Nazi really take over and than humiliate those people?\n\nAnd overall, I wish whole this conflict never happened, it only ignited more power for Putin and just gave him another free term. Even after Putin, the sad part is and I hope it wont happen, Russians going to choose someone who will also have stand against West and Jesus Christ I hope its not those lunatics, because trust me Putin is pretty good to compare with others.","duration":"","id":1049,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_ckw0f4e","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1048,"links":[1017],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"colbster91","label":"What\u0027s your perspective on the Ukraine situation?","duration":"","id":1048,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_ckvzpc1","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1017,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"devoro","label":"Well, as I am Russian I would say that, I don\u0027t need someone calling Moscow for problems.

To what do you attribute the success of ISIS, if not through the support, or at the least, the acquiescence, of the people being swept into and broken off in vast chunks from their previous puppet states?\n\nDo you genuinely believe that a splinter militant wing of a terrorist group, armed for the most part with soviet era small arms, is cutting through and dissolving national borders defended by first world funded, first world equipped, and first world trained armies, and further they\u0027re achieving all of this success with such apparent ease totally against the majority will of the people\u0027s living in the regions folding to ISIS like butter?\n\nI\u0027m not trying to be an ass. Do you genuinely believe the majority of people under ISIS controlled territory are opposed to them?\n\nSure, they\u0027re doing horrible things. War fucking sucks. Our armies do them too. You\u0027re lying to yourself if you think articles just like the one\u0027s you\u0027ve cited here concerning our atrocities weren\u0027t used by groups like ISIS to recruit and support hate against the west. Hurting and terrorizing innocent people is wrong, and all war criminals, foreign and domestic, should get their fucking day.\n\nSo what do you want to do about it? Do you want to use our military might to assert  American sovereignty in this war torn region over a limited area for a limited time? Are you really concerned about these atrocities like you say? Because I am too, and I believe it\u0027s very clear that we need to defend these people, while at the same time, ensuring that we do not become engaged in the destiny of local politics that we don\u0027t have a right to guide. Personally, I think there is an easy and clear solution. \n\nThe problem is, there is a struggle for which political and militant entity will maintain and assert sovereignty over certain areas. A struggle we as Americans believe people have a right to fight for if they feel disenfranchised and without alternative. \n\nIn the absence of a force capable of asserting sovereignty and defending innocent people, the United States has every right, and even a duty, to set up refuge camps, across this tumultuous region, declare them American soil until the struggle is settled. We offer safe haven and humanitarian aid to those who do not wish to take part in that struggle, we make all factions and sides fully aware that we are a neutral force, concerned with nothing more than providing innocent people a means to escape the violence and hell that is war. That the struggle for governance is not our fight, and we don\u0027t want anything to do with it, and that our military will be defending these small camps of American soil, and all of our evacuation efforts, with extreme prejudice against any hostile force. Aggression towards the protection of the innocent will be met with the immediate obliteration of all hostile forces within threatening distance, as well as some additional military assets elsewhere chosen by our intelligence to inflict handicap. The right thing to do is defend the innocent, and create the circumstance that those responsible for war crimes or attacks against those in our custody would be jeopardizing their ability to continue their struggle. Something is definitely amiss when the world\u0027s most powerful military force by orders of magnitude is duking it out in the sand with regional rebels using small arms trying to carve out a state. What\u0027s wrong here is exactly what got us here. Engaging in local politics and street brawls for no clear reason, instead of just out right telling these people they can carry on with their struggle, but we\u0027re going to defend the innocent, and we don\u0027t really give a fuck what they think about that, nor what they have to say. The most powerful military on the planet should be able to protect some refuges, and let those fighting for power know that when any one of them meet the conditions of a sovereign nation, we\u0027ll send a diplomat to discuss our withdraw after seeing to the safety of civilians needing our care. That\u0027s it. ISIS doesn\u0027t deserve a response nor a missile until they win and establish a state or attack us where we are asserting sovereign control. We don\u0027t have to acknowledge them or concern ourselves with their civil war, and we shouldn\u0027t.\n\nIt\u0027s a win for everyone. We get to have the baddest fucking military in the world, it gets to maintain a limited deployment and keep our soldiers fit and sharp. All the things those banging the war drums love about banging war drums. But we also get to show the world that we don\u0027t just talk about high minded ideals and the difference between right and wrong, but that we really do believe in things, like a nation and people\u0027s right to determine their own future and government. But most importantly, our soldiers won\u0027t just be called heroes for the psychology of it, they\u0027ll be defending the lives and rights of innocent people from the hell of war during a crisis of sovereignty at gun point. The world shouldn\u0027t hear Americans call their soldiers heroes, the world should collectively acknowledge that the deeds of our military are heroic. Our army should help feed and defend those who seek our help. We should be asking for a coalition of nations to send humanitarian aid and logistical support to provide for the women and children and elderly with whose suffering you and I both appear to be against, while our army defends our perimeter, tracks warring factions, implements a buffer between the civil war and those who want no part in the fight. We could be proud of the size of our military budget, show the world what good we could do with it, attain the undying loyalty of mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters who, through our kindness, were led out of a war zone and kept safe. And when the struggle ends, we engage the sovereign entity diplomatically. If we\u0027ve kept up our word and behaved honorably by allowing the struggle to play out without our influence, the victorious government would have little reason not to engage in a civil diplomatic negotiation concerning the release of our claimed sovereignty within and around its borders, and provide honest answers as to the safety of minorities, rival religious factions or tribes, previous enemy combatants, and the like. If we determined that it would be unwise for a group to remain in the borders of the state after things settle, we could easily assist in the evacuation and asylum of those in our custody who wished to leave, then the United States and its coalition of nations could pack up their shit and go home, knowing that they had done the only right thing they could, they provided for the defense of innocent people during a struggle for sovereignty and self rule to which all people are entitled.\n\nThat\u0027s how you fucking be an American. You say shit like \"the only legal government is one that derives its legitimacy from the people\" and you fucking mean it. You don\u0027t immediately try to pervert the concept of legal government with an influx of billions in cash. \n\nWe could do that...or we could do what we\u0027ve been doing for decades. Trying to make someone the good guy and someone the bad guy, playing enie meenie minie moe to decide who we\u0027re going to make our all powerful puppet, only a representation of what we pretend we believe, and whose militia we\u0027re going to make our enemy for whatever stupid reason. We could continue creating power vacuums, choosing sides, fostering hate for us on at least one side of every battle we have no business being in, forcing people fighting for their basic right to chose their government into desperation and debauchery, beating them down to the point they are forced to maintain rule over any territory they have managed to gain through brutality and fear because they\u0027ve suddenly been handed the short straw by the west and attacked by an hideously more powerful force. Imagine that little more than a year ago we came a breath away from choosing a side in the Syrian conflict and ousting Assad, now we\u0027re bombing those who threaten his rule, when neither is our place. We should have assisted in protecting the hundreds of thousands of people who are dead now while the battle raged. We could have done the right thing. We could have saved lives and reduced suffering. Instead we\u0027re going to help the dude we nearly spent billions unseating last year? How fucking stupid are we? One thing is clear, the suffering and death of innocent people is not what is motivating our governments decisions. It\u0027s costing the tax payer billions and billions, and we keep failing to help the very people our leaders claim those billions must be spent to save.\n\nWe could continue our failed policies, continue failing, and continue on exactly the way we are now, but that\u0027s not what America is to me. \n\nI want our government to actually stand for the things it says it does. I want it to do the right thing. I want it to use our military to defend the rights of people, and the lives of the innocent. Even those with whom we appear to have deep ideological gulfs between. People who don\u0027t look like us, don\u0027t think like us, don\u0027t believe like us. \n\nIf we say our way is better and we believe it, the least we should be able to do is live by it. If we say people have a right to fight and form their own governments, we should mean it. If we say we\u0027re waging war to defend the little guy, let\u0027s quit fucking rolling in the sand with every upstart from the village and fucking defend the little guy.","duration":"","id":1208,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_ckwd9y1","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1207,"links":[1199],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"truth__bomb","label":"\"widespread local support \"\n\nhttp://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/8/16/islamicstate-syriakillings.html\n\nhttp://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/7/18/un-islamic-stateiraqgovtguiltyofabuses.html\n\nhttp://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/8/27/syria-islamicstatewarcrimes.html","duration":"","id":1207,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_ckw427f","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1199,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"webonics","label":"Because we know where the fuck Putin stands.

(See the first article above).\n\nIn Syria (and to a lesser extent in Iraq due to Suni vs. Shia feuding): ISIS\u0027s success is largely a result of the power vacuum that exists. Assad\u0027s regime also had a tacit agreement with ISIS to not fight. \n\nhttp://www.syriadeeply.org/articles/2014/08/5965/advantage-assad-moves-isis/\n\nAnd don\u0027t forget that the bombing of ISIS targets is being led by the U.S., but has support from countries around the globe including the U.K. (which roundly rejected joining the last U.S. campaign in the Middle-East) as well as Belgium and Denmark (not exactly hawkish countries there). \n\nhttp://time.com/3433346/isil-isis-uk-belgium-denmark/\n\nAll told, there are 40 countries in this coalition. The Netherlands is in it. Canada. (Two more that try to stay out of international military affairs). Qatar, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt. \n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2014/09/14/world/meast/isis-coalition-nations/?c\u003d\u0026amp;page\u003d1\n\nIn addition, just the other day, a poll of Turkish citizens said that, in contrast to other recent polls, a majority of the people support action against ISIS.\n\nSo while speaking in platitudes about the U.S. and its often questionable military actions is all well and good (I even agree with you on most of it), here, with regard to ISIS, you\u0027re wrong. Until you can provide actual, overwhelming evidence of your point, of course.\n\nSure there must be some local support, but there\u0027s some local support of the KKK here in the States. But I would hope that someone might step in if they were leading a successful military campaign within our borders.","duration":"","id":1209,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_ckwjcd4","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1208,"links":[1207],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Webonics","label":"Let me ask you a question. To what do you attribute the success of ISIS, if not through the support, or at the least, the acquiescence, of the people being swept into and broken off in vast chunks from their previous puppet states?\n\nDo you genuinely believe that a splinter militant wing of a terrorist group, armed for the most part with soviet era small arms, is cutting through and dissolving national borders defended by first world funded, first world equipped, and first world trained armies, and further they\u0027re achieving all of this success with such apparent ease totally against the majority will of the people\u0027s living in the regions folding to ISIS like butter?\n\nI\u0027m not trying to be an ass. Do you genuinely believe the majority of people under ISIS controlled territory are opposed to them?\n\nSure, they\u0027re doing horrible things. War fucking sucks. Our armies do them too. You\u0027re lying to yourself if you think articles just like the one\u0027s you\u0027ve cited here concerning our atrocities weren\u0027t used by groups like ISIS to recruit and support hate against the west. Hurting and terrorizing innocent people is wrong, and all war criminals, foreign and domestic, should get their fucking day.\n\nSo what do you want to do about it? Do you want to use our military might to assert  American sovereignty in this war torn region over a limited area for a limited time? Are you really concerned about these atrocities like you say? Because I am too, and I believe it\u0027s very clear that we need to defend these people, while at the same time, ensuring that we do not become engaged in the destiny of local politics that we don\u0027t have a right to guide. Personally, I think there is an easy and clear solution. \n\nThe problem is, there is a struggle for which political and militant entity will maintain and assert sovereignty over certain areas. A struggle we as Americans believe people have a right to fight for if they feel disenfranchised and without alternative. \n\nIn the absence of a force capable of asserting sovereignty and defending innocent people, the United States has every right, and even a duty, to set up refuge camps, across this tumultuous region, declare them American soil until the struggle is settled. We offer safe haven and humanitarian aid to those who do not wish to take part in that struggle, we make all factions and sides fully aware that we are a neutral force, concerned with nothing more than providing innocent people a means to escape the violence and hell that is war. That the struggle for governance is not our fight, and we don\u0027t want anything to do with it, and that our military will be defending these small camps of American soil, and all of our evacuation efforts, with extreme prejudice against any hostile force. Aggression towards the protection of the innocent will be met with the immediate obliteration of all hostile forces within threatening distance, as well as some additional military assets elsewhere chosen by our intelligence to inflict handicap. The right thing to do is defend the innocent, and create the circumstance that those responsible for war crimes or attacks against those in our custody would be jeopardizing their ability to continue their struggle. Something is definitely amiss when the world\u0027s most powerful military force by orders of magnitude is duking it out in the sand with regional rebels using small arms trying to carve out a state. What\u0027s wrong here is exactly what got us here. Engaging in local politics and street brawls for no clear reason, instead of just out right telling these people they can carry on with their struggle, but we\u0027re going to defend the innocent, and we don\u0027t really give a fuck what they think about that, nor what they have to say. The most powerful military on the planet should be able to protect some refuges, and let those fighting for power know that when any one of them meet the conditions of a sovereign nation, we\u0027ll send a diplomat to discuss our withdraw after seeing to the safety of civilians needing our care. That\u0027s it. ISIS doesn\u0027t deserve a response nor a missile until they win and establish a state or attack us where we are asserting sovereign control. We don\u0027t have to acknowledge them or concern ourselves with their civil war, and we shouldn\u0027t.\n\nIt\u0027s a win for everyone. We get to have the baddest fucking military in the world, it gets to maintain a limited deployment and keep our soldiers fit and sharp. All the things those banging the war drums love about banging war drums. But we also get to show the world that we don\u0027t just talk about high minded ideals and the difference between right and wrong, but that we really do believe in things, like a nation and people\u0027s right to determine their own future and government. But most importantly, our soldiers won\u0027t just be called heroes for the psychology of it, they\u0027ll be defending the lives and rights of innocent people from the hell of war during a crisis of sovereignty at gun point. The world shouldn\u0027t hear Americans call their soldiers heroes, the world should collectively acknowledge that the deeds of our military are heroic. Our army should help feed and defend those who seek our help. We should be asking for a coalition of nations to send humanitarian aid and logistical support to provide for the women and children and elderly with whose suffering you and I both appear to be against, while our army defends our perimeter, tracks warring factions, implements a buffer between the civil war and those who want no part in the fight. We could be proud of the size of our military budget, show the world what good we could do with it, attain the undying loyalty of mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters who, through our kindness, were led out of a war zone and kept safe. And when the struggle ends, we engage the sovereign entity diplomatically. If we\u0027ve kept up our word and behaved honorably by allowing the struggle to play out without our influence, the victorious government would have little reason not to engage in a civil diplomatic negotiation concerning the release of our claimed sovereignty within and around its borders, and provide honest answers as to the safety of minorities, rival religious factions or tribes, previous enemy combatants, and the like. If we determined that it would be unwise for a group to remain in the borders of the state after things settle, we could easily assist in the evacuation and asylum of those in our custody who wished to leave, then the United States and its coalition of nations could pack up their shit and go home, knowing that they had done the only right thing they could, they provided for the defense of innocent people during a struggle for sovereignty and self rule to which all people are entitled.\n\nThat\u0027s how you fucking be an American. You say shit like \"the only legal government is one that derives its legitimacy from the people\" and you fucking mean it. You don\u0027t immediately try to pervert the concept of legal government with an influx of billions in cash. \n\nWe could do that...or we could do what we\u0027ve been doing for decades. Trying to make someone the good guy and someone the bad guy, playing enie meenie minie moe to decide who we\u0027re going to make our all powerful puppet, only a representation of what we pretend we believe, and whose militia we\u0027re going to make our enemy for whatever stupid reason. We could continue creating power vacuums, choosing sides, fostering hate for us on at least one side of every battle we have no business being in, forcing people fighting for their basic right to chose their government into desperation and debauchery, beating them down to the point they are forced to maintain rule over any territory they have managed to gain through brutality and fear because they\u0027ve suddenly been handed the short straw by the west and attacked by an hideously more powerful force. Imagine that little more than a year ago we came a breath away from choosing a side in the Syrian conflict and ousting Assad, now we\u0027re bombing those who threaten his rule, when neither is our place. We should have assisted in protecting the hundreds of thousands of people who are dead now while the battle raged. We could have done the right thing. We could have saved lives and reduced suffering. Instead we\u0027re going to help the dude we nearly spent billions unseating last year? How fucking stupid are we? One thing is clear, the suffering and death of innocent people is not what is motivating our governments decisions. It\u0027s costing the tax payer billions and billions, and we keep failing to help the very people our leaders claim those billions must be spent to save.\n\nWe could continue our failed policies, continue failing, and continue on exactly the way we are now, but that\u0027s not what America is to me. \n\nI want our government to actually stand for the things it says it does. I want it to do the right thing. I want it to use our military to defend the rights of people, and the lives of the innocent. Even those with whom we appear to have deep ideological gulfs between. People who don\u0027t look like us, don\u0027t think like us, don\u0027t believe like us. \n\nIf we say our way is better and we believe it, the least we should be able to do is live by it. If we say people have a right to fight and form their own governments, we should mean it. If we say we\u0027re waging war to defend the little guy, let\u0027s quit fucking rolling in the sand with every upstart from the village and fucking defend the little guy.","duration":"","id":1208,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_ckwd9y1","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1207,"links":[1199],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"truth__bomb","label":"\"widespread local support \"\n\nhttp://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/8/16/islamicstate-syriakillings.html\n\nhttp://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/7/18/un-islamic-stateiraqgovtguiltyofabuses.html\n\nhttp://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/8/27/syria-islamicstatewarcrimes.html","duration":"","id":1207,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_ckw427f","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1199,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"webonics","label":"Because we know where the fuck Putin stands.

This gives the Cartels alot of wiggle room, and slows down progress. \n\n\nI compare the Cartels, whether Los Zetas or Sinaloa , as the same thing as Al Qaeda and ISIS. Both are fuelled by ideologies and a lack of education to its countries poor. A large part of the problem can be taken care of through military means, but the crucial issue will always remain as long as the government isn\u0027t taking care of its impoverished. Once, money starts getting into where it is suppose to, Cartel numbers will drop significantly, since a huge part of their members are all from poor communities without an alternative to make money and feed their families.

Rome at its peak was unrivalled in terms of military prowess. Both were best at skirmishes, could not siege and once Romans introduced heavy cavalry they gained a massive advantage. There has never existed such a large gap ever in history between a single military and the rest of the world in every form of military capability.\n\nAgain I don\u0027t think you read any of those wars in great detail. Read about the countless battles with the Mamluks, they defeated them and then they came back with heavy infantry constant battles that the Mongols lost. They were an unstoppable force until they met the Mamluks who found very noticeable chinks in the way they fought and abused it and defeated them. There is a reason they never crossed Egypt. Mongols met their equals in Mamluks. This is also why a lot of historians think they would have a hard time against European armies.\n\nInitial Arab armies won not due to superior technology, supplies, troops, weaponry but due to tactics. They had some of the greatest generals in the history of military history like Khalid Bin Walid. The entire argument is \"best military in the history of the world\". The Arabs were not the best military in the history of the world they had genius generals who took large scale battles and turned them into smaller skirmishes which the tribal bedouins were accustomed too and they used hit and run tactics. They faced their equals countless times and were evenly matched against the Byzantine and Sassanian empire.\n\nAlexander\u0027s army was matched by the Persians in terms of capability, technology except for light cavalry etc. Alexander met an equally capable military in the persians. \n\nThe statement \"American military is the best in the history of the world\" implies that the gap that exists between American military today and other militaries is so large that never before in history has this happened. This has nothing to do with winning or losing it has to do with being rivalled by anyone else because even the American military has lost. The Romans have been the only military with such a large gap that they were unrivalled at their peak against anyone.\n\nHas nothing to do with winning or losing.

ISIS was on the scene and taking cities and doing their business for MONTHS before America\u0027s involvement cropped up.\n\nIt was only AFTER the public rejected an invasion into Syria and then the next week America\u0027s stance was that ISIS was in fact a target. Syria is the refuge of Isis. This is not a coincidence, it is using ISIS as a prop. By the way, regarding all the horrible shit ISIS is doing, its not new, and in fact, we didn\u0027t even condemn it when it was Saddam Hussein doing the same things with his Royal Guards. Im talking about the worst of the worst, Nazi level, Mongolian raider level evil under Saddam, and he was our key ally because we needed a jackboot thug to hold the Sunni-Shiite state together. There\u0027s a horrific story of a woman with her baby boy, her 5 year old boy, and her 10 year old daughter who was walking near one of Saddam\u0027s prisons and the guard picked up her daughter by her ponytails, shot the 10 year old girl in the face. Then he proceeded to shoot her 5 year old boy in the side of the head, then shot the baby in the face. He then had an orderly put the 3 dead children into a trolley bin and forced the lady to sit atop her 3 dead children.\n\nWe supported this shit.\n\nStop with the fucking pretense.\n\nISIS sprang up out of not going with the 2nd option to the first Gulf War, that is the 3 state solution. Until we know our involvement and what we want to do for the next TWENTY years in Iraq, we should have zero business because this is exactly the type of shit that gets us in trouble for the last 50 years from Iran and Khomeni to the completel failure that is our Iraq involvement. Everything we did there was 100% idiotic, from setting up a \"blessed\" governement that we expected Iraqis to sacrifice their lives for when the governmental structure we setup made zero sense for the people living their. That has been the story of iraq since the Sykes Picot Agreement and we need to GTFO because we have been fucking with their region for far too long.They need to go through their own wars, and settle shit their own way, and get a complete reboot from post-British/French/American colonial \"protectorate\" society.","duration":"","id":1377,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_ckvxgyk","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Obama: \u0027They Don\u0027t Call Moscow\u0027 When There\u0027s Trouble In The World","label":"trot-trot","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_2hsgyo","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.412029731E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.412055102E9,"simScore":0.7190287609899517,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":1378,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"uchuujin_haryuhdo","label":"International community when disaster strikes: help us America!!\n\nInternational community when America steps in: fuck off America!!\n\n","duration":"","id":1378,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_ckvy60d","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Obama: \u0027They Don\u0027t Call Moscow\u0027 When There\u0027s Trouble In The World","label":"trot-trot","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_2hsgyo","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.412029731E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.412056476E9,"simScore":0.7186173604180415,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":1379,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"my__name__is","label":"US has more friends than Russia.
