Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice and others all had professional and personal experience in the oil industry, where Saudis are important players.  Bush himself has many Saudi personal friends.  The fact that one of the main threats to our security was a Saudi-funded group, which was made up of many Saudis was hard to reconcile.\n\nThese facts were both part of why they had a hard time recognizing the severity of the threat posed by al Qaeda, and why even after 9/11/2001, they focused on the absurd idea that Iraq/Saddam Hussein had anything to do with the attacks.

It wasn\u0027t their inability to comprehend non-nation-state groups as being dangerous that caused them to focus on Iraq after 9/11. They were focused on Iraq when they walked in the door in January 2001. They wanted to depose Saddam Hussein from the very beginning of the administration.\n\nThat\u0027s the key to passage I highlighted in the article, where they said the reason they did not think the intelligence was credible, was that they thought that Bin Laden was trying to trick the CIA into distracting them from the real threat of Saddam Hussein.\n\nThat occurred because when Bush took office, the majority of his administration --  including Pentagon officials -- wanted regime change in Iraq. They wanted to \"finish\" what they thought George H.W. Bush left unfinished back in 1991. They had a singular focus, and they were not going to let themselves get sidetracked by \"reports\".\n\nOf course, 9/11 *did* eventually end up sidetracking them, but only temporarily. The Bush administration would have invaded Iraq whether 9/11 happened or not, it was their policy from the beginning.\n\nThis comes not just from the linked article, it\u0027s stuff I\u0027ve read over the course of the years. This article does seems agree with, and tie together, all of these other scattered reports regarding the Bush administration, 9/11 and Iraq.\n\nPersonally, I think that this is people trying to save their own \"reputations\" of that whole fiasco that was the Bush administration. Now that time has passed, and there\u0027s not much political cost for speaking out against the Bush administration...they\u0027re all coming out of the woodwork to say, \"It wasn\u0027t me! I was one of the people that was trying to tell them what they were doing was wrong!\"\n\nI\u0027m glad the real story is getting out.

A global terrorist organization like al Qaeda which wasn\u0027t linked to or run by any particular nation simply didn\u0027t fit into how they saw the world working, so it was difficult to convince them of the threat.  One of the main offenders was Dr. Rice, who was a Soviet specialist - throughout her life, education and professional experience, all the \"actors\" in the world were either nation-states themselves or direct proxies.\n\nThe other element that they struggled with was the fact that to whatever small degree al Qaeda was linked to any particular nation, that nation was Saudi Arabia.  Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice and others all had professional and personal experience in the oil industry, where Saudis are important players.  Bush himself has many Saudi personal friends.  The fact that one of the main threats to our security was a Saudi-funded group, which was made up of many Saudis was hard to reconcile.\n\nThese facts were both part of why they had a hard time recognizing the severity of the threat posed by al Qaeda, and why even after 9/11/2001, they focused on the absurd idea that Iraq/Saddam Hussein had anything to do with the attacks.  When you only see nation-state-actors, and you are friendly to Saudi Arabia, the main regional opponent of Saudi Arabia sure looks like a good target.\n\nThis doesn\u0027t make the success of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks exclusively or even primarily the fault of the Bush administration, but it certainly points out some of their limitations which contributed to the problem.","duration":"","id":17,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_c6784kk","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":16,"links":[5],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"mdot","label":"\u0026gt;What would you have done differently?\n\nInteresting point...\n\nThe main theme of the article that was linked, was that the intelligence community was trying desperately to get the White House to even *recognize* that there was an imminent threat.\n\nMaybe the WH could have asked the CIA if they had identified any of the members of the group.

They released an official memo in 1998 that said our focus needs to be getting Saddam out of power, and that this would likely take a very long time unless there was some sort of event that would galvanize the American people. I believe the exact language they used was, \"a new Pearl Harbor\" that could be used to convince people we needed to send military to Iraq to get rid of Saddam\u0027s regime.\nThey didn\u0027t just know about it, they wanted it. Also check out FBI Agent Harry Samit. He suspected he had found someone who was plotting to hijack an airplane to use in a terrorist attack, because the flight instructor contacted him about a suspicious guy who only wanted to learn how to fly the plane but wasn\u0027t concerned with learning how to land one. This seems almost cartoonish, but is precisely what happened. Agent Samit was denied a search warrant to search the suspected terrorists computer over 70 times. After reviewing this, and many other pieces of evidence (had to write a 10 page research paper on the topic) my conclusion is that is superiors knew about it, and didn\u0027t want him to foil the plot since they were going to use it as a way to convince people we needed to get Saddam.\nTL;DR - PNAC (Cheney, Rumsfeld) are on record in \u002798 wanting there to be a successful terror attack against the United States, and FBI Agent Samit figured out there would be a hijacking terror attack and was blocked from doing anything about it by his superiors.\n\nFrom user actiongroup in another thread.

What are you exactly assuming here? Out of context it looks like your point has leverage, but I literally can\u0027t follow the flow of conversation all the way to what you said right here. It isn\u0027t making any sense to me.\n\nDude said position of lutherans used to be racist because of a root philosophy from the religion. Then, someone else said that this isn\u0027t fair to say because they have changed their minds (they can\u0027t do that? who says?) and quoted Hinkley saying a more morally righteous stance of race in accordance with how the religion has evolved.\n\nAnd then you come and say that two years later people still feel uncomfortable about being the race they are. Ok. Doesn\u0027t this mean they feel this way because of people who aren\u0027t taking what Hinkley said seriously? If this isn\u0027t representative everywhere, then what\u0027s the point in saying his quote isn\u0027t a saving grace? It\u0027s not supposed to even be a saving grace in the first place, and no one said it was. It was meant to reflect the modern stance on race from the LDS church.\n\nI feel like from point to point I can understand why you said that. But looking at the thread as a whole, I don\u0027t see how what you said is explicitly relevant and pertains exactly to what the argument was. So,\n\n\u0026gt; Really?\n\nYes.\n\n\u0026gt;So it doesn\u0027t bother you that just six years ago a \u0027\u0027prophet\" had to tell Mormons to not be jerks to people that were a different color than them?\n\nNo, this does bother me.

If a Muslim makes friends with anyone who is not a Muslim, he has broken a law of Islam, and gone against his \"god,\" Allah. He may appear to be your friend as long as he can use that \"friendship\" to his own benefit, or the benefit of his kind (the Koran permits that).

Hitler put a spin on Christianity in order to gain more followers in Nazi regime. \n\nAnd you smarten up! Try backing up what you are claiming with fact.
