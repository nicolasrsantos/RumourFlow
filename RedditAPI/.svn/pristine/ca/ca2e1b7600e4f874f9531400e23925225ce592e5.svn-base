My mom still thinks Obama is a Muslim and every time I cite a source debunking this, she claims that they've been forced to cover it up by the government or Obama.

The good news is that she thinks (correctly) that McCain is a fake Christian, so she's just staying home and not voting.

Wish I could say the same for my Dad, who thinks Obama is going to bring Mayor Daley's corrupt Chicago politics to Washington. ++sigh++
She said it shouldn't matter, but she doesn't want to live in a Muslim country.

Man, I really don't know how to respond to that kind of stuff. It's like my synapses short-circuit or something.
If someone ran for President openly stating that they did not participate in any organized religion, I would be much more inclined to vote for them.

Pandering to the lowest common denominator may make for good politics, but its just wrong IMO.
It's obvious you hate the United States. I'd suggest you find another country to live in, but they'd probably kill you just about anywhere you go. 

How about we let Alabama secede and all of you idiots can go live there and elect all the idiot leaders you want.
No, bro... Jews save money.
Try France.
What major parties in France have elected Muslims to prominent positions?
