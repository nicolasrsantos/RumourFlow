I like to use his real title: Bishop Romney.
Not only that, but the Soviet Union was one of the most successful empires in world history, how can people look at that as a reason "communism only works on paper" and it's doomed to fail?  You know what dooms a country to fail?  Threats and massive military buildup on the part of the *other* major empire in the world.

I wonder how the USSR would have thrived if the United States hadn't been actively trying to destroy it since it started?
When democrats say Obama is a liberal.  I believe in Obama.  I voted for him, twice.  But he is not liberal.

He's further left than Bishop Romney, but he's still ULTRA-Conservative compared to other governments I've lived under around the world.  A lot of Americans don't realize that the US is a conservative, Christian country, with Christian laws and conservative ideas.
I've never lived in the Middle East.  Morocco is about the same level of conservatism as the USA, but that's my only experience in Africa.
Okay, well I was comparing it to places I've lived.
