That's why they call him a *socialist*. 
Mmm... "bias" depends on your analysis, no? Is there an objective standard for responsibility in media culture? Media culture certainly believes so, as they talk about 'responsible journalism' frequently. If they aren't adhering to the definition of responsible journalism, then it's reasonable to characterize them objectively as being irresponsible.

Furthermore, I don't think anyone questions the use of the term "Talking heads" for any political pundits on the boob tube. Or perhaps you're suggesting that "Obama is a Muslim" is *not* a lie? Or that no "Talking Heads" on TV (and radio) actually subtly reinforce that view?

And as people on both sides of the current political debates *all* routinely refer to irresponsible journalism, I think it's tough to call that partisan bias. 

So Yeah, there's bias, but the only bias I can see here is that he considers "Obama is a muslim" to be a false statement, leading to his analysis of the rest.
I'm interested. How would you characterize the disingenuousness of a tv personality that is *less* inflammatory than "irresponsible journalism"? 
Oh, I can introduce you to people who believe he's a Muslim pretending to be Christian to complete Islam's enslavement of America and re-establish the Caliphate from our highest political office.
You mean from the United States?
Oh, yeah, I'd LOVE to move to Frisco. Seems like a million other monkeys wanna live there, too, though. I love college towns, too. Just spent a week in the Bay Area (Santa Clara, Milbrae, SF) and didn't want to leave.
