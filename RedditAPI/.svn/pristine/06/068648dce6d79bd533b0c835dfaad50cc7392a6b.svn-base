Seriously.  Therefore, it is wrong to hit women.  Full stop.  Wrong.  It is also wrong to hit men.  Violence is wrong.  Not a hard concept.  \n\n2) Reality means that there are situations in which violence, regrettably, may be inevitable.  I am not such a pacifist as to say that you can\u0027t defend yourself when others are being violent to you.  \n\n3) But, if you\u0027re going to be violent out of self-defense, the standard is the *minimum level of violence necessary to protect yourself.* If you use any more excessive force than is necessary to end the threat to your personal safety, then you are wrong.  \n\n4) The reason people discuss this in gendered terms is because a woman hitting as hard as she can typically causes a fraction of the damage of a man hitting as hard as he can.  And that\u0027s got to be taken into consideration.  However, bottom line is, why is anybody hitting as hard as they can?  Try to never be violent to anybody, if necessary only use the minimum amount of violence necessary to safely escape the situation, and terminate relationships which have become violent.

If you determine it from the stance of how valuable are people AS people, then everyone is equal.\n\nIf you determine worth in a more specific way, i.e. how valuable is a person as a running back in the NFL, then smaller less muscled people will be worth less. This applies to both genders. As a male who is 5\u002710\" and 160lbs, I\u0027m worthless in the NFL. The ceiling for size and strength (not necessarily technical ability) is much higher for men than it is for women, and, as such, the vast majority of women would also be worthless in the NFL.\n\nIn a general sense, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s ok for a larger person to beat a smaller person in an unfair fight. Since men, in general, are larger and stronger than women, then most of the time they shouldn\u0027t be hitting women. This works in reverse for physically dominant women. I would not want to be in a fistfight with Venus or Serena Williams, for instance.\n\nI guess what I\u0027m saying is that this is a pretty loaded question. Ostensibly it\u0027s a yes or no question, but you\u0027re using people\u0027s answers as a way to determine how they feel about all gender issues which really isn\u0027t fair. To my eyes, this is a question of how physical dominance should or should not be applied. As ChaosBeast pointed out, generally speaking men have more muscle mass and higher bone density than women. So, generally speaking, men should not hit women.

And it was a slap, which by rights is no better than a punch - they can be devastating. \n\nHere\u0027s the context. I was sitting at the bar when I was 18. One mate with me. It was an AFL season breakup, so the bar was full of footy-heads. \n\nOver the course of a couple of hours, this woman in her late twenties kept shoving in next to me, pushing me and abusing me. Just to get to the bar. While it was busy, there was at least 6 feet between me and other patrons - beside my mate. \n\nAs the night wore on, she ended up trying to pick a fight with me. She was drunk as hell, I was sober still. Ive seen woman try stir shit with guys in order to get their husband or boyfriend (perhaps girlfriend?) to woop ass for them. I figured that was where this was going. \n\nShe threatened to punch me, all while hollering for her other half to appear and \"save her from this awful man\". She finally did let loose, when I turned back to the bar shaking my head, swing a hook that got me rigt in the fucking ear. \n\nI spun around on the bar stool and let loose a open hand slap to her cheek. Sounded like a movie slap, but didnt even welt her face. Just shocked her into silence. \n\nHer other half had walked up in time to see both things occur his instant reaction was to become aggressive towards me, but my friend talked him down explaining what had happened. \n\nThe boyfriend actually led her to the door bounces, came back and bought me a glenfidich scotch. We ended up mates, and he ended up dumping her 2 days later because she confronted him about me \"beating her up\". \n\nI think in my case it was warranted. Theres never been another time that Ive struck a woman. Single or since ive been married. My wife knows this story and she agrees with me. To the point where she says if she was being violent towards me, she would expect nothing less than for me to try shock sense into her. If I were being violent to her, she\u0027ll grab something heavy and finish it.  \n\nBut then again, my wife is a badass and doesnt take crap. *sigh* she wears the pants in this household.

Where, historically, it was seen as justifiable to inflict violence to women - and it continues today, through the issue of violence against women issues beng ignored. The fact that 70% of women (here in Canada at least) have experienced violence represents something systemic. In the same way that targets of rape are usually because of vulnerability and powerlessness, other forms of violence should also be viewed through such a lens.\n\nUltimately, I don\u0027t see a husband beating his wife as the same thing as the Pink Saris beating up a man who committed rape (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulabi_gang). One is an example of oppression .. the other, an example of resistance. I am not suggesting that violence is the answer, it\u0027s just oversimplifying the matter to not examine it more critically. ...though to even bring this up as an issue seems to suggest other motives .. I am not sure I really see a whole systemic issue of violence directed towards men by women .. why is this even being brought up?","duration":"","id":559,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c2pya2v","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"If your view of hitting men is ANY DIFFERENT than your view of hitting women, then YOU DON\u0027T DESERVE EQUALITY.","label":"leapson","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_l59ht","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.318126164E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.318150525E9,"simScore":0.7041534111286127,"sentiment":"  Positive"},"timestamp":1.318151211E9,"simScore":0.7236769160041523,"sentiment":"  Positive"},{"index":561,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"roofdweller","label":"Well the question \"is it ever okay to hit a woman\" also kind of assumes that the audience is male...

Women take the dumb classes in college like french poetry and psychology while men take the smart courses like engineering, math and chemistry.\n\n[Any other bright words, bitches?](http://i.imgur.com/E5mU8.jpg)\n\nI keep seeing the question, \"is it ok to hit a woman?\" implying that there is *normally* never a good reason to hit a woman ... But this also implies that there are many or more acceptable reasons to hit men.\n\nWell I say this: If your view of hitting men is **ANY DIFFERENT** than your view of hitting women, then **YOU DON\u0027T DESERVE EQUALITY.** You can\u0027t [pick and choose equality at your convenience](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003d1_2LpLhOsc4)\n\n**Edit:** Let\u0027s keep this in the context of someone *attacking* you, and you having the right to defend yourself (man or woman). This is not about randomly hitting strangers.\n\n**Edit:** If someone attacks you and you happen to break their nose when just pushing them away would have stopped them just the same, you are not at fault. Yes, you should only use enough force to stop them from attacking you. But the responsibility should fall on the attacker, not the defender. That\u0027s just common sense. The defender shouldn\u0027t be held accountable if, in a split second decision, they decided to punch instead of shove because they did not initiate the violent action. They are just defending themselves against it.\n\n**Edit**: [For those not understanding the point of gender in this debate](http://www.scribd.com/doc/34551310/The-Principles-of-Social-Competence)\n\n**Edit**: When speaking about \u0027equality\u0027, we need to make the distinction between equality of worth and equality of function. They are not the same. Men and women are equal in worth *when they are fulfilling their own different gender functions*. This means they are not \"equal\" in what they do. For example, a man is not \"equal\" to a woman when speaking about bearing children. Only women have a womb to bear a child. So that is her specific gender function. But they are both worth the same when they perform those different gender functions.\n\nThe problem comes in when women try to compete with men and *replace the male gender function*. Obviously men are stronger, smarter, etc. than women because those things are male functions. So when women compete against men in *male functions*, men are superior. Again, not in worth but in function.\n\nYet, when both male and female perform their different gender functions, they are not longer competing. They are not complementing each other in their different functions.. Just like the head and body serve different functions. When either competes to replace the other\u0027s function, there is the thought of superiority. But when each fulfills its own function, they are complementing each other, therefore they are equally essential. They have the same net worth.\n\n**Edit:** Well it\u0027s official! Women are too fucking dumb to come up with an intelligent response, thus proving the points above. And the [emasculated emo fags](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dPpd6LHfhkd0) of reddit (aka the white knights who don\u0027t get any pussy) have proven that men raised by single mothers are emotional wrecks who fail at life. This is why the vast majority of felons who end up behind bars are raised by single mothers (as proven by govt. stats). Emasculated men not only think like women and use ridiculous amounts of chick logic, they are unable to tell the difference between throwing an emotional tantrum and constructing an intelligent viewpoint --something only **REAL** men are capable of :)\n\nIt\u0027s common sense that men are smarter than women. Men invented EVERYTHING. Men invented CIVILIZATION. Without men, women would be sweeping a dirt floor w/o walls or a roof (aka their home). \n\nI know I know, the truth hurts. But too bad bitches. I get the last word. All you get to do is cry in the fetal position like a good professional victim :)\n\n**Edit**: [How to tell if you\u0027re emasculated](http://i.imgur.com/jfF2N.jpg)\n\n**Edit:** Proof that men are smarter than women:\n\n1.

They are not the same. Men and women are equal in worth \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;when they are fulfilling their own different gender functions\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;. This means they are not \u0026amp;quot;equal\u0026amp;quot; in what they do. For example, a man is not \u0026amp;quot;equal\u0026amp;quot; to a woman when speaking about bearing children. Only women have a womb to bear a child. So that is her specific gender function. But they are both worth the same when they perform those different gender functions.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The problem comes in when women try to compete with men and \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;replace the male gender function\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;. Obviously men are stronger, smarter, etc. than women because those things are male functions. So when women compete against men in \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;male functions\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;, men are superior. Again, not in worth but in function.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Yet, when both male and female perform their different gender functions, they are not longer competing. They are not complementing each other in their different functions.. Just like the head and body serve different functions. When either competes to replace the other\u0026amp;#39;s function, there is the thought of superiority. But when each fulfills its own function, they are complementing each other, therefore they are equally essential. They have the same net worth.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Edit:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; Well it\u0026amp;#39;s official! Women are too fucking dumb to come up with an intelligent response, thus proving the points above. And the \u0026lt;a href\u003d\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dPpd6LHfhkd0\"\u0026gt;emasculated emo fags\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; of reddit (aka the white knights who don\u0026amp;#39;t get any pussy) have proven that men raised by single mothers are emotional wrecks who fail at life. This is why the vast majority of felons who end up behind bars are raised by single mothers (as proven by govt. stats). Emasculated men not only think like women and use ridiculous amounts of chick logic, they are unable to tell the difference between throwing an emotional tantrum and constructing an intelligent viewpoint --something only \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;REAL\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; men are capable of :)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;It\u0026amp;#39;s common sense that men are smarter than women.
