Even heaps of old swords from the middle ages. Just an insane amount of old, dumped, mostly unmaintained and unusable old weapons. \n\nThen one has to wonder, why? Why would people (from each time period) just take a huge stash of then modern weapons and randomly hide them some place? Turns out it\u0027s cultural, specifically something with regards to property laws, in the USA all land is owned by either someone, or the government, in many middle eastern nations, traditionally, a no-man\u0027s land is just that, owned by no man.

I\u0027m not of the \"oil grab\" camp.  In fact, I think that a reason for toppling Saddam\u0027s regime had more to do with establishing a foothold in the region, and had it *worked*, would probably have been a brilliant strategic move.\n\nPutting aside moral issues, Iraq was a prime candidate to be a puppet regime.\n\nTo really think about it from a pragmatic point, consider that the only time the Saudis have allowed us to project military power in the region, they\u0027ve had to be in danger themselves.  The relationship with Saudi Arabia is very one-sided which is why Kuwait was leveraged exclusively during Operation Iraqi Freedom as a staging point as opposed to how Saudi Arabia was utilized in Operation Desert Shield and then Storm.  To call Saudi Arabia a fairweather ally is probably generous.\n\nThe only other somewhat friendly country in the region is Israel, and frankly it\u0027d be political suicide to attack any Arab or Persian country from within Israel... if they\u0027d even let us.  After all, Israel is very much like Saudi Arabia in that they are an ally provided it 110% aligns with their own objectives.\n\nSo, you have Iran, where an attempt to install a puppet regime failed miserably with the UK and US re-installing the Shah of Iran and is now a theocracy.  Any attack on Iran would almost certainly be seen as a direct assault on Islam itself.\n\nIn Iraq, you have a largely secular leadership structure, a ruthless dictator who has committed various war crimes and atrocities (not terribly unlike Syria, but on a broader scale), and was generally seen as a thorn in the side of all its neighbors.\n\nThe idea would be to topple Saddam, install a puppet regime, and have a much friendlier base of operations in the region.  Access to the Strait of Hormuz was a definite plus as the go-to threat from Iran is to shut down the strait and thus drive up oil futures.\n\nTL;DR:  It wasn\u0027t so much an oil grab as it was an attempt to have a stable base of operations from which to project power and influence in a region where the most influential OPEC members laid their heads.
