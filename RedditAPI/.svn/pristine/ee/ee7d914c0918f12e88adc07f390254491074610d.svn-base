A Christian who supports infanticide lmao
You mean the side that supports killing newborns?
Abortion is one thing, [infanticide is another.](http://www.lifenews.com/2012/08/23/new-audio-surfaces-of-obama-defending-infanticide-in-illinois/)
Obama's opinion is an informed one. That's why his policy decisions are shaped by eugenicists who openly support infanticide and have written about intentionally creating poverty in order to coerce pregnant women into having abortions.

Seriously? The Muslim thing?? You mean, it has nothing at all to do with [Obama's proven track record of lawlessness](http://dailycaller.com/2014/05/07/ted-cruz-releases-definitive-list-of-76-lawless-obama-actions/) and [deceit](http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2014/11/10/obamacare-architect-yeah-we-lied-to-the-stupid-american-people-n1916605) and [outright lies?](https://danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/2013/08/15/obama-252/)

Perhaps what's even more outrageous is that \u\AW12321 agrees with your asinine statement and gets a bunch of mindless upvotes for it.
&gt;its almost the number one thing they complain about him....wanting a simple answer

You said the Muslim question is the number one thing conservatives complain about Obama. /u/AW12321 actually agreed with you in order to propagate that ridiculous meme, and got upvoted a bunch of times. I countered his nonsense with actual facts that reveal Obama's true character. That is the simple answer.

As far as my opinion on why he's doing these things, you first should ask yourself if you *really* want to know. 
&gt; it is pretty high up on the list

Funny how something "so high up on the list," wasn't mentioned AT ALL during the first republican debate, nor is it expected to come up during any subsequent debate.

&gt;enlighten me.

Simply put, Obama's policies are intended to break America and usher in a new Dark Age. You may think that's a joke, but I can assure you it's not:

Fruits of the Spirit. Do you think the Holy Spirit would compel such detestable actions? I mean, this guy has supported and continues to support terrorism. He's intentionally taken actions which impoverish people. He kills people and brags about it. Those are fruits of the Holy Spirit? 
No, I'm saying that [a good tree does not bear bad fruit.](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Luke%206.43â€“45)
