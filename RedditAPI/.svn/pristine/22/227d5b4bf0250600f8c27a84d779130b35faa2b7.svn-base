The chance that someone who wanted to embezzle money from all the 9/11 chaos would be arrested and sentenced with harshest punishment had to be so huge that no smart man would even consider trying to profit from this - after all, you don\u0027t need your millions in prison.

And US can\u0027t afford to lose wars where it is defender(like WW2), because since 1918 US is the only country that had the resources to stop monstrosities like Hitler from rampaging through the world and killing *truly* innocent people.

Terrorists are not good as national enemies for US because they\u0027re invisible and also they are unpredictable in the sense that they are not tied to any rules of honorable warfare. They aim not at military, but infrastructure, civilians. Western world hands are tied by Geneva conventions and the likes. Terrorists know that so they kill civilians and when western world responds with an attack they use civilians as their shields and spread the hoax around. Therefore US has to go fight wars on enemy territory just to defend its own people(that are not very grateful for it, mind you, but they should be). Never before it used to be the case that to defend your home you have to fight on enemy soil, which is huge advantage for your enemy.\n\nAnd no, they fight arabs not because of arab natural resources.

The chance that someone who wanted to embezzle money from all the 9/11 chaos would be arrested and sentenced with harshest punishment had to be so huge that no smart man would even consider trying to profit from this - after all, you don\u0027t need your millions in prison. And not so smart people... Well, we all know that stupid people are not big fans of rational decisions. \n\nThe quote you used is about national unity and it\u0027s common knowledge that a nation needs an enemy to keep its unity high, because low national unity \u003d crisis. And US can\u0027t afford to lose wars where it is defender(like WW2), because since 1918 US is the only country that had the resources to stop monstrosities like Hitler from rampaging through the world and killing *truly* innocent people. And now their  economical resources are running low and now is exactly the time when they need 1)its population to stop going nuts about all the conspiracy theories 2)allies, most importantly - Europe.\n\nAnd US\u0027s national unity was never as high as when they had USSR as its enemy simply because USSR was right there, visible, red and big, and obvious. Terrorists are not good as national enemies for US because they\u0027re invisible and also they are unpredictable in the sense that they are not tied to any rules of honorable warfare. They aim not at military, but infrastructure, civilians. Western world hands are tied by Geneva conventions and the likes. Terrorists know that so they kill civilians and when western world responds with an attack they use civilians as their shields and spread the hoax around. Therefore US has to go fight wars on enemy territory just to defend its own people(that are not very grateful for it, mind you, but they should be). Never before it used to be the case that to defend your home you have to fight on enemy soil, which is huge advantage for your enemy.\n\nAnd no, they fight arabs not because of arab natural resources. By the next few years US shale gas industry will be so huge that it will satisfy its own need + will be able to save any European nations from Russian gas monopolies...

With the buckling of these critical columns, the collapse then progressed east-to-west across the core, ultimately overloading the perimeter support, which buckled between Floors 7 and 17, causing the remaining portion of the building above to fall downward as a single unit.

BUILDING 7!?!?**\n\nDebris from the collapsed twin towers caused fires and the sprinkler system failed.

With a loss of lateral support across nine floors, column 79 buckled – pulling the east penthouse and nearby columns down with it. With the buckling of these critical columns, the collapse then progressed east-to-west across the core, ultimately overloading the perimeter support, which buckled between Floors 7 and 17, causing the remaining portion of the building above to fall downward as a single unit. The fires, fueled by office contents, along with the lack of water, were the key reasons for the collapse.\n\n**2. The buildings all collapsed uniformly at near free fall speed implying a coordinated severance of support beams along with pictures showing 45 degree angled cuts on support beams not consistent with melting the columns.**\n\nThey didn\u0027t fall at free fall speeds.  As explained [here](http://www.debunking911.com/freefall.htm):\n\n\u0026gt; In every photo and every video, you can see columns far outpacing the collapse of the building. Not only are the columns falling faster than the building but they are also falling faster than the debris cloud which is ALSO falling faster than the building. This proves the buildings fell well below free fall speed. That is, unless the beams had a rocket pointed to the ground.\n\n[This site](http://www.debunking911.com/thermite.htm) has pictures of the same 45 degree angle beam that truthers talk about being proof of thermite being cut by a worker during rescue operations.\n\n**3.

Despite spending a good 30 seconds detailing what constitutes an ad hominem attack and why it is a logical flaw, the narrator resorts to said attacks multiple times in the video.  Granted, the narrator\u0027s attacks are more nuanced than the standard \u0027my opponent is stupid\u0027, but they serve the same purpose nonetheless.  Among these attacks are repeatedly linking Americans to some type of crazed nationalist who thinks that the US is the best and can do no wrong. Other insinuations about the US government being as bad as the Third Reich are present.  Lastly, the narrator on multiple occasions says that those who disagree \"lack critical thinking skills\" or some variation thereof.  In what way is that not an ad hominem attack?  On a less serious note, the use of the term \"fake skeptic\" to describe those who do not agree with the narrator is also an ad hominem attack.  The Wonka meme in the middle of the video did not help the narrator\u0027s cause.  Terms like \u0027religion of the state\u0027 also are questionable at best, and ad hominem attacks at worse.\n\nIt should also be noted that the narrator\u0027s allusions to science (to the point where he accuses the other side of the argument as \"giving lip service to science\") being on his side (which is never proven) is a very veiled Argumentum ad Populum, or appeal to the people.  In this case the people is the group who sees themselves as logical (regardless of reality).  Since most people like to think they are logical, he is appealing to most people.  It should be noted that had the narrator shown any scientific literature to back himself up, this would not be a logical fallacy. But allusions meant to stir up emotion are generally not acceptable forms of debate.\n\nNow, on to specific faults.  The narrator has the problem with Americans being unwilling to accept his evidence whereas others (specifically Europeans) are more open to his claims.  He also states that true skeptics constantly question their own assumptions.  Now, if the latter were true our narrator would question the assumption that Americans and Europeans view attacks on American soil in the same way.  Common sense should tell you this is untrue.  Obviously the Americans have much more of an emotional investment in 9/11.  His core assumption is violated.  Following his own assertion about skeptics, he should address this.  He does not.\n\nBack to the ad hominem stuff.  The whole ad hominem diatribe/explanation that the narrator goes on is itself a red herring argument.  What an ad hominem attack is or who uses it is completely irrelevant to whether September 11 was an inside job or not.  I realize that the video is actually entitled \"Fake Skeptics \u0026amp; The \"Conspiracy Theorist\" Slur\" and thus the ad hominem stuff could be seen a relevant. If that were true, it would seem out of place that the narrator makes an argument for either side of the 9/11 inside-job debate, instead of treating 9/11 as a case study.  \n\nI an tired, so just a quick note on Building 7 vis a vis BBC reporting.  If I recall correctly, Fox news also jumped the gun a bit on reporting of the collapse.  The narrator asserts that there are two situations: no cover up or cover up.  He also asserts that since the BBC reported of the collapse early there must be a cover up.  This is a false dichotomy.  The narrator assumes there are two possible truths, and since on is untrue it must be the other which is true.  I am purely speculating here, but could there not be another possible truth where some frazzled NYC PR worker mistyped collapsing (as in \"building seven is collapsing\") and it autocorrected to collapsed (\u0027buidling seven is collapsed\u0027)?  It may be far fetched, but the point stands.  There are not only two outcomes, so any argument based on there only being two outcomes is invalid.\n\nAs I said, I am tired (5am here), so please do excuse any grammatical/spelling/other errors.

He also asserts that since the BBC reported of the collapse early there must be a cover up.  This is a false dichotomy.  The narrator assumes there are two possible truths, and since on is untrue it must be the other which is true.  I am purely speculating here, but could there not be another possible truth where some frazzled NYC PR worker mistyped collapsing (as in \"building seven is collapsing\") and it autocorrected to collapsed (\u0027buidling seven is collapsed\u0027)?  It may be far fetched, but the point stands.  There are not only two outcomes, so any argument based on there only being two outcomes is invalid.\n\nAs I said, I am tired (5am here), so please do excuse any grammatical/spelling/other errors.

With a loss of lateral support across nine floors, column 79 buckled – pulling the east penthouse and nearby columns down with it. With the buckling of these critical columns, the collapse then progressed east-to-west across the core, ultimately overloading the perimeter support, which buckled between Floors 7 and 17, causing the remaining portion of the building above to fall downward as a single unit. The fires, fueled by office contents, along with the lack of water, were the key reasons for the collapse.\n\n**2. The buildings all collapsed uniformly at near free fall speed implying a coordinated severance of support beams along with pictures showing 45 degree angled cuts on support beams not consistent with melting the columns.**\n\nThey didn\u0027t fall at free fall speeds.  As explained [here](http://www.debunking911.com/freefall.htm):\n\n\u0026gt; In every photo and every video, you can see columns far outpacing the collapse of the building. Not only are the columns falling faster than the building but they are also falling faster than the debris cloud which is ALSO falling faster than the building.

Open-minded people who investigate the evidence tend to come out the other end seeing it for what it is, whereas those who have made up their minds in advance that the official theory need to be true are very resistant to the data. I think that\u0027s why [psychologists have offered their opinion on the phenomenon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dmEGgAk1AbA4), as we don\u0027t live in a psychological, sociological and cultural vacuum.\n\n\u0026gt;At no point will they consider if they could be incorrect\n\nAnd you will?

With the buckling of these critical columns, the collapse then progressed east-to-west across the core, ultimately overloading the perimeter support, which buckled between Floors 7 and 17, causing the remaining portion of the building above to fall downward as a single unit. The fires, fueled by office contents, along with the lack of water, were the key reasons for the collapse.\n\n**2. The buildings all collapsed uniformly at near free fall speed implying a coordinated severance of support beams along with pictures showing 45 degree angled cuts on support beams not consistent with melting the columns.**\n\nThey didn\u0027t fall at free fall speeds.  As explained [here](http://www.debunking911.com/freefall.htm):\n\n\u0026gt; In every photo and every video, you can see columns far outpacing the collapse of the building. Not only are the columns falling faster than the building but they are also falling faster than the debris cloud which is ALSO falling faster than the building. This proves the buildings fell well below free fall speed. That is, unless the beams had a rocket pointed to the ground.\n\n[This site](http://www.debunking911.com/thermite.htm) has pictures of the same 45 degree angle beam that truthers talk about being proof of thermite being cut by a worker during rescue operations.\n\n**3. Multiple Eye-witness accounts of explosion coming from the basement and bottom floor, along with the janitor that was in basements burns.**\n\nThis is hard to refute without specifying who exactly these witnesses are and showing me their statements.  Even if we are to accept this, eyewitness accounts are notoriously unreliable, especially in a situation like this, and those sounds/visuals could have been caused by other things.  \n\nI also find it strange that anyone close enough to see these explosions survived (since they would have been right before the collapse), that there is no video or photo evidence of this happening, and that this contradicts the idea of a controlled thermite burn that is postulated by your last and next point.\n\n**4.

Otherwise we could just light buildings on fire after turning off the sprinkler systems. Again, not a truther, but it would be great to hear a long and official explanation as to why WTC7 fell due to fires as it did. The fact that it had no sprinkler system working is irrelevant, as I will show you examples that were actually in worse shape.\n\n[The One Meridian Plaza Fire](http://www.interfire.org/res_file/pdf/Tr-049.pdf)\n\n[More on the One Meridian Plaza Fire](http://www.iklimnet.com/hotelfires/meridienplaza.html)\n\nOne Meridian Plaza is a 38-floor skyscraper in Philadelphia that suffered a severe fire on February 23, 1991. The fire started on the 22nd floor and raged for 18 hours, gutting eight floors and causing an estimated $100 million in direct property loss. Sprinkler systems were dried in the first hour and the fire continued for 17 hours after that. The fire caused window breakage, cracking of granite, and failures of spandrel panel connections.\n\n[The Beijing Mandarin Oriental Hotel Fire](http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/02/09/us-china-fire-idUSPEK19411020090209)\n\nThe craziest thing about the fire above is that it literally engulfed the entirety of the building in flames. It was under construction (about to open) but didn\u0027t have a sprinkler system currently working to stop the first fire when it began. Despite the fact that the fire extended across all of the floors for a period of time and burned out of control for hours, no large portion of the structure collapsed.\n\nOf course, both of the examples I give have slight differences in structural make-up, but that actually helps the alternative side of the argument. The One Meridian Plaza was constructed with both steel and iron beams in a more wide configuration in comparison to WTC7 and the twin towers. The The Beijing Mandarin Oriental Hotel was actually constructed like twin towers were mistakenly reported to be which was used as an explanation for the failure of the beams holding it together. \n\nIn any case, I don\u0027t believe this disqualifies the official story, it just leaves some questions that people desire to have answered. Because people desire answers to these questions and don\u0027t receive them right away, they begin looking for proof in their own assumptions later.

With a loss of lateral support across nine floors, column 79 buckled – pulling the east penthouse and nearby columns down with it. With the buckling of these critical columns, the collapse then progressed east-to-west across the core, ultimately overloading the perimeter support, which buckled between Floors 7 and 17, causing the remaining portion of the building above to fall downward as a single unit. The fires, fueled by office contents, along with the lack of water, were the key reasons for the collapse.\n\n**2.

The effect on the national humor would have been far less significant had the towers stood and the additional thousands of people not died. Secondly, some people claim that the buildings were destroyed partially to hide evidence of something else, especially building 7. I don\u0027t know much about that though. \n\n\u0026gt;....like I don\u0027t know \"terrorists plant explosives in the WTC\".\n\nSetting up a controlled demolition on that scale would have taken months. It would not have been believable that terrorists could pull that off. Additionally, why fly planes into buildings that you were going to later destroy anyway?\n\nI\u0027m going to trust the over [1500 architects and engineers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dhZEvA8BCoBw) who maintain that there is no way that these buildings, especially building 7, should have failed. NIST simply does not appear to be doing anything other than towing whatever line they are given and ignoring obvious avenues for investigation. Not so surprising though. Why would anyone who suspects foul play from the government trust the government\u0027s word? The analogy would be simply asking a suspected murder if she\u0027s innocent and proceeding to let her off on her word. \n\nThe thing which keeps me feeling uneasy though is the sheer amount of suspicious components in play here. I am perfectly capable of agreeing that some of the \u0027evidence\u0027 of government conspiracy is incorrect, but for it *all* to be incorrect seems more and more unlikely. One thing is for certain: the official story very likely does not reflect reality.

A huge portion of the Bush administration were part of an organization called The Project for the New American Century. http://www.newamericancentury.org/   Take a look at who the founders are. This site is not a joke, it is very real. \n\nThe main quote I recall from their website, which I saw with my own two eyes, was something along the lines of \"we would need a Pearl Harbor level event to inspire the American people to follow the President without question\". This was in regard to the plan to invade a middle eastern country, such as Iraq, and impose an American style democracy. That would start a cascade of democratic change in the region, with the US being the big brother controlling the family of countries. \nI heard about PNAC from a late night host in SF after 9/11, and thought he was full of it. But then I decided to follow up and prove him wrong. To my surprise I found that the website, and the organization, were exactly as he described. That quote used to be right up front, I think it has since be either removed or buried 3 levels deep in a policy page.\n\nDon\u0027t believe me, please check it out for yourself.

Consider how easy it is to hold a dumbbell in place and then imagine what would happen if you tried to catch that same dumbbell that was dropped from nine feet above you. Unless you ease into the catch you will have no chance of catching the weight at all. \n\nLets do some napkin math. Supporting a 10 Newton weight takes 10 Newtons of force. If we drop that weight from 3 meters in the air it has about 300 Joules of energy at impact. Now say we want to decelerate that mass over 0.5 meters. We need to apply 600 Newtons of force over that 1/2 meter to slow it down. That\u0027s **sixty** times more force than it took to keep the weight in place.\n\nThe same thing happened when the towers collapsed -- steel beams don\u0027t have a lot of give before they buckle.

Does the government possess the capability to have the communication and control networks in place worldwide to orchestrate such a plan? Of course it does. But they didn\u0027t have a perfect execution. Mistakes were made. If it had been perfect, there would have been no trace of a cover up or any evidence left that could implicate them. Instead what we have is a massive debate about this coming up on 12 years later, and it doesn\u0027t look like it will be settled anytime soon. Instead of clarifying and enhancing public knowledge of what happened, the government sought to hide what it knew, and write the history books based on their classified knowledge. Not enough knowledge to adequately explain the details of what happened, but enough to legitimize and prosecute wars against two countries and create a massive surveillance state aimed at its own people. \n\nOr what the government is hiding is that these were the most brilliant mastermind motherfuckers who ever lived. Not only did the hijackers manage to get 4 planes at once, they managed to time their attack perfectly when NORAD was incapacitated by internal drills and unable to respond to real threats. They achieved a 75% success rate and created total destruction to three buildings while only hitting 2, but hit the Pentagon in the most reinforced, least populated spot possible while executing an extremely difficult maneuver to do so. Despite this, they were clumsy enough to leave incriminating evidence behind that linked them to their organization and linked them to contacts in Afghanistan and Iraq that would implicate a larger group that the U.S. would surely go after. They went beyond a moon shot to pull this off, but couldn\u0027t cover their tracks good enough and left enough classified evidence to justify two wars in two countries. Our government is too embarrassed to tell us the full scope of how bad they got caught with their pants down. They weren\u0027t asleep at the switch, they were blacked out drunk at the switch. No one dropped the ball though. They were just standing there, minding their own business, when al Qa\u0027ida just came out of the blue and blammo, every reason they could need to go to war for as long as we want and spy on and kill our own people because terrorism.\n\nEither way, the government failed in it\u0027s mission. Whether it was to cover it\u0027s tracks and totally implicate someone else, or they let the country down so bad, we can never know the depths of it.

If I was to approach a religious fundamentalist (someone who mainstream religious folk would call crazy, or \"out there\") and try to convince them that perhaps God doesn\u0027t exist or that he does exist, but they\u0027re interpreting the Bible the wrong way, they would likely pull back further into their delusional, extreme thinking.

I understand the anger and feeling of helplessness. I used to work in Washington DC, I\u0027ve been to some high-level, closed-door political strategy meetings, and I left politics with a bad taste in my mouth.

It\u0027s possible that people *thought* there were explosions.  I\u0027d want to see some corroborating evidence like seismograph readings, security camera footage, unmistakable chemical residue, and so on. \n\n\u0026gt; Traces of nano-thermite in the dust collected from the scene.\n\nA quick google search pulled up [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dwbjYoINw5oI) that discusses the \"nano-thermite.\" In short, there\u0027s some doubt raised that the contents of the dust (which was collected long after the towers collapsed) actually contain particles of thermite. The compounds found in thermite are also found in a lot of other materials that were also present in the buildings. In short: it\u0027s not a smoking-gun. \n\nHere\u0027s why I\u0027m not convinced by those who claim it was an inside job:\n\n* The number of people needed who would be \"in on it\" would be hard to manage. You\u0027d think that someone, somewhere would have either had a deathbed confession, or been eaten up with guilt and committed suicide while leaving a note, or dropped a hint to a family member while talking about their past. The same argument works against those who claim we never landed on the moon, for example. Humans are very bad at keeping secrets.\n* If sufficient demolition charges were placed in the towers, when were they placed, and why didn\u0027t any of the office workers notice them? With controlled demolitions, explosives are placed strategically with lots of detcord laying about. If the charges were successfully placed, undetected, would not the conspirators be afraid that someone in the building might report, via cell phone perhaps, explosions?\n* Were the other, previous attacks by al Qaeda also inside jobs? Was the explosion on the USS Cole also an inside job? The embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya?\n* If al Qaeda was *not* responsible, would it not be bad for the conspirators if al Qaeda presented evidence that it was an inside job? Surely, there\u0027d be plenty of documents to show that the bombers claimed to be on those \nplanes were not.\n* Why planes, and why so many? Why not just one plane, or an attack that does not require a complex amount of training and coordination? If the conspirators had the ability to wire the building with detonation charges, why not have trucks filled with fertilizer bombs? Prior to 9/11 it would have been easy to convince people that such explosives were shipped in shipping containers.\n\nUltimately, the inside job hypothesis is simply inconsistent with a government that screws up far too often. If there is a portion of the government that *is really good* at this stuff, it seems far too risky a plan, when there are alternatives that involve fewer planes and fewer variables.  \n\n\n","duration":"","id":410,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cbpzdxe","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"I believe 9/11 was an inside job.

Nigro took over as Chief after (I believe it was Peter Gancy) died during the collapse of one of the Twin Towers. Around 2:30 PM EST on 9/11, Nigro established a collapse zone around WTC7, fearing that a collapse of the building was imminent. Nigro said he established the collapse zone because of four major reasons. He writes\n\u0026gt;1. Although prior to that day high-rise structures had never collapsed, The collapse of WTC 1 \u0026amp; 2 showed that certain high-rise structures subjected to damage from impact and from fire will collapse.\n2. The collapse of WTC 1 damaged portions of the lower floors of WTC 7.\n3.

That\u0027s pretty scary.\n\nShe has a Master\u0027s from the London School of Economics (!!).\n\nIn the activities prior to \"arrest\" it states \"Lindauer claims she was conducting peace negotiations with representatives of Muslim countries (including Iraq, Libya, Malaysia, and Yemen) in New York. According to transcripts Lindauer presented to the New York Times in 2004, these included meetings with Iraqi Muthanna al-Hanooti, another peace activist later accused of spying. Lindauer also says that the U.S. intelligence community was aware of these meetings and monitoring her\".\n\nI was looking for any evidence that she would be a \"CIA asset\" as she\u0027d claimed; this cover story certainly makes sense.  (If you look at her wikipedia article, what is reported as fact about her career).\n\nIf she were delusional, she would have \"invented in her head\" all the Iraq negotiations stuff.  But Wikipedia, mysteriously, backs up her cover story, which is pretty outlandish.  Presumably, because she has a lot of evidence of it.\n\n\"(The judge) noted that the severity of Lindauer\u0027s mental illness, which he described as a \"lengthy delusional history\", weakened the prosecution\u0027s case.\"\n\nObviously, any CIA agent who went ahead and told the actual story of their handler and status would come off as completely delusional.  They have cover stories, that make sense.  And then weird ties which make no sense whatsoever.\n\nNamely:\n\nAt a hearing in July 2008, Lindauer told reporters that she had been a CIA asset, and said she had \"been hung out to dry and scapegoated\".[14]\n\nIn 2008, Loretta A. Preska of the Federal District Court in New York City reaffirmed that Lindauer was mentally unfit to stand trial—despite Lindauer\u0027s insistence to the contrary.[7][19] Preska ruled that Lindauer\u0027s belief in her connection to the intelligence community was evidence of her insanity.[20]\"\n\n\nDoes Preska have any qualifications whatsoever to judge a spy whistleblower?  She says that on its face any spy who claims to have connections to their spy agency is evidence of insanity.\n\nHow are we to reconcile this with our statement that a leak is of particular interest to us?\n\nAny spy or intelligence community member who came out against it would sound insane.  That\u0027s the JOB of spy communities, to make what they\u0027re doing seem totally implausible.\n\nThis is the most damning evidence,\n\"In testimony before Judge Mukasey on May, 9, 2006, Dr. Colin Vas from Carswell FMC admitted that over seven months of incarceration, staff observed no signs of hallucinations and no signs of hearing voices, nor any depression or bipolar disorder. \"\n\nOh really?  So, she has one, very specific, level-headed delusion only, that she was a spy.  For which her educational background just happens to make her completely qualified.  And which just happens to completely fit her profile as a Master\u0027s from a prestigious university and being on foreign soil, as well as having worked for representative\u0027s of congress (according to the Wikipedia article, undisputed).\n\nSpecifically, it states of her incarceration:\n\n\"arswell reported that Ms. Lindauer walked 4–6 miles on the track every day, and consistently participated at \"indoor recreation activities.\" Ms.Lindauer also spent many hours at the prison law library studying up on her case. In its monthly reports, Carswell wrote: \"Good physical health. Socializes well. Good intellectual functioning.\" And \"no behavioral problems.\" [21]\"\n\nThen, very very bizarely, we get this statement:\n\"On 16 January 2009, the government decided to not continue with the prosecution saying \"prosecuting Lindauer would no longer be in the interests of justice.\"[6][22]\"\n\n\n\nThat is really interesting, don\u0027t you think?  Why would they mention \"justice\" in this context?\n\n\nThe story for me seems to add up 100% (based especially on the lines about how level-headed, intelligent, and socially normal she was) on her being a CIA asset, and 0% on her being a delusional freak.\n\nSpecifically, she really doesn\u0027t fit the profile, nor entertain any other conspiracy theories.\n\n\nFinally, if you are going to refute me can you please start with something before starting with her and her credibility:\n\nPlease start by summarizing the CIA\u0027s budget and the profile, as you understand it, of actual CIA agents in the field (don\u0027t try to search too deep or whatever, just glance at their budget and the profiles of their agents and operatives as you understand them).\n\nThen, please mention, specifically, how her profile differs.","duration":"","id":492,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cbq78iz","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"I believe 9/11 was an inside job.

Not too long after that I was exposed to 9/11: In Plane Site as well as others, and the copious amounts of conspiracy videos of YouTube. As someone of above average intelligence and a skeptic by nature I have never taken conspiracy theories too seriously, as many rely on sparse circumstantial evidence but for whatever reason this feels different.\n\nMy main reasons for suspecting foul play in order of importance:\n\n1. BUILDING 7!?!?\n2. The buildings all collapsed uniformly at near free fall speed implying a coordinated severance of support beams along with pictures showing 45 degree angled cuts on support beams not consistent with melting the columns.\n3. Multiple Eye-witness accounts of explosion coming from the basement and bottom floor, along with the janitor that was in basements burns.\n4. Traces of nano-thermite in the dust collected from the scene.\n\nIm honestly not sure what to make of all this evidence, but something just strikes me as unsettling, and I see a lot of skeptics to whom I look up to (Micheal Shermer, Bill Maher to a lesser degree, etc.) dismissing the notion and Im not sure what Im overlooking that they arent.

Both sides have produced compelling arguments but after reassessing probability figures and relinquishing my right to observe evidence and draw my own conclusions due to my egregious lack of knowledge on the subject, the reality is that it would be insurmountably difficult to orchestrate something of this magnitude. I still think its a little fishy, but my common sense tells me thats probably due to authorities lack of a clear picture, not direct involvement and subsequent cover up.
