Don't make a assumption based on that poll. I can guarantee that a large majority of those voters were 40+. They are the large chunk of the ignorant retards that are allowed to vote. I am a Mississippi resident and college student and all of the younger generation are far less ignorant and better informed than these old fucks. 
We all are 
People may think that Mississippians are retarded, which I strongly agree with, but it is the older generation that is holding our state back honestly. I got down voted to hell I here with my other posts but the young voters will prove that we are making headway. Btw the only candidate that has been represented on campus is Ron Paul 
My friends and I live in Mississippi and we were the first to know about the SOPA and NDAA. We retweeted everything and tweeted our own thoughts, surprisingly our younger generation embraced it. Don't make assumptions that we don't know anything down here. 
No I retweeted that it was something important and that everybody needed to be informed about. Good try and along with my other post, this was very early on when he had not fixed the bill to say no Americans may be detained. 
Once the baby boomers die off they will become much better in these states. They are the ignorant block 
That is why I get so frustrated with my home state, I just don't get why these people have that kind of ideology. 
My county in Mississippi, by statistics is in the top 15 in the country. Or was three years ago when I was a senior in high school. If you were to take the Delta out of Mississippi, the state would be in the top 25 also. 
No! I have no idea who in the hell they interviewed haha I would love to see. I haven't heard anybody I know or talk to call him a Muslim.
