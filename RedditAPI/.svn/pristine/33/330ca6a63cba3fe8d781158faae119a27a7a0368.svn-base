People that are making up their mind AFTER watching the commentary are being influenced by Luntz because it\u0027s Luntz\u0027s action plan that determines how the commentators frame their commentary. If the president says \"investment,\" Luntz recommends you present that as \"spending\" for example. Notice how so many of these people just brushed aside the president\u0027s words and indicated that he isn\u0027t very knowledgeable.  That\u0027s Luntz! He\u0027s spent 2 years advising the right to attack Obama\u0027s core competency: Competence. He\u0027s arguably one of the most intelligent, educated men to hold the office of the presidency for a long time... so what do you do? Just say he\u0027s a clueless fruitbag over and over and over again while simultaneously demonizing \"book lernin\u0027\"(notice the woman who said he gives \"textbook answers). Hey lady! The answer in the textbook is often the CORRECT answer! \n \n","duration":"","id":38,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_c1fzxa5","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":35,"links":[34],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"djbabykillah","label":"\u0026gt;\"All that would be all well and good... except for the fact that Frank Luntz\u0027s strategies WORK.
