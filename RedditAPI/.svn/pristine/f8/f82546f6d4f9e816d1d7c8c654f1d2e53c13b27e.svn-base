They already thought Obama was a muslim. They already think all these things Trump has been saying. What happened here is that the republican party created a monster. And that monster is not Trump... it is the silent majority of the republican \"base\" (which is different from what people would call the \"establishment\") who have always held these beliefs under the surface. They\u0027ve not been very politically active before because they just don\u0027t give a shit. They\u0027re too busy hating the world for changing to even bother voting. And the republican party always tried to get them to come out, but their candidates\u0027 traditional rhetoric and refusal to admit the true nature of many of their followers bigotry meant those people were mostly reduced to the sidelines of politics...\nBut now, Trump has activated that base... the people that guys like Rubio can never court because Rubio will never come out and refuse to condemn the KKK, even though Rubio knows that KKK-style white supremacists vote republican.... trump can somehow not condemn the KKK and condemn them in the same day and come off just the same to his supporter.\nThey created a party whose base thrives on bigotry and hate, while fielding candidates who tried to claim that those values were not part of the republican party.\nThis is what makes trump so dangerous. His followers are so ignorant, so bigoted and so entrenched in their ideals that there is effectively no way to change their minds.\n\n#GODLY RESPONSE:\nGet off your high horse you condescending asshole. Liberal blowhards like yourself are more preoccupied with social justice than the undeniable evisceration of blue collar jobs and the middle class. It\u0027s like you see Trump rise up out of nowhere, convince yourselves that racism must be the reason, and then bury your head in the sand while ignoring the real reason why Trump is popular. As for global warming, why don\u0027t you give a good fucking reason why exactly the US should impose restrictions on itself? Ever been to China? It\u0027s a fucking smog waste land. Last time I checked, China was part of the Earth too, and might uh, be an enormous contributor to global warming. If liberals had testicles they would reason that pressuring China into imposing stricter standards on itself would do much more good for the Earth than imposing restrictions at home. I guess doing that would be too confrontational and feelings might get hurt.
