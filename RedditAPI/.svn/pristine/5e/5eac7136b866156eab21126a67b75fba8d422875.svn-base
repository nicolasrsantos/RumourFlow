In America we have no religious test for office, but in the U.K. Catholics are still banned from serving as Prime Minister.  I think that bias against Catholics in the year 2007 is worthy of scorn, yet I understand why it is a black person can be prime minister but not a Catholic.  I think Blair wouldn\u0027t have been worse or better had he been allowed to convert and that the U.K. should do away with that restriction.\r\n\r\nAs for a Muslim becoming President of the United States of America, perhaps we should think hypothetically about members of other religions being elected to the most powerful office on the planet.  Should Americans consider electing a candidate who declares he is personally a devout Satanist but that his private worship of the devil in no way would influence how he leads the nation?  Let\u0027s say a Branch Davidian wanted to be elected President and when pressed declared that David Koresh was a prophet but that what happened at Waco was a moment from his religion\u0027s past, should people accept that this private religious affiliation didn\u0027t have bearing on leadership ability?  Maybe a practitioner of Ayum Shinriko wants to rule, does this strike anyone as troubling?\r\n\r\nIn the largely secular West people tend to think of religion as little more than a private tradition which takes up at most an hour or so on the weekends, but this is not the case for sincerely devout people.  A devout Jew is Jewish not just on Saturdays and the same goes for anyone who is sincerely religious.  Different belief systems lead to different world views.
