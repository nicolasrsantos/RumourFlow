The term had a more complex interpretation between 1949 and 1983 and the move to independence of many of the colonies, with subject status existing alongside citizenship of an individual country or colony.\n\n\u0026gt;Currently the term \u0027British subject\u0027 refers, in [British nationality law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nationality_law), to a limited class of people defined by Part IV of the [British Nationality Act 1981](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Nationality_Act_1981). Under that Act, two groups of people became \"British subjects\"; the first were people from the [Republic of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland) born before 1949 who already claimed subject status, and the second covered a number of people who had previously been considered \"British subjects without citizenship\", and were not considered citizens of any other country. This second group were predominantly residents of colonies which had become independent, but who had not become citizens of the new country. The status cannot be inherited, and is lost on the acquisition of any other citizenship; it will therefore cease to exist on the death of the last remaining subjects.\n\n\u0026gt;The term \u0027subject\u0027 is used rather than \u0027citizen\u0027 because in a monarchy the [monarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch) is the source of authority in whose name all legal power in [civil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(common_law\\)) and [military law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_law) is exercised, the people of a monarchy in former times being regarded as the monarch\u0027s subjects who were under certain obligations such as owing allegiance to, and thereby entitled to the protection of, [the Crown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown).\n\n\u0026gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^British ^Subject ^passport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Subject_passport) ^| [^British ^Nationality ^Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Nationality_Act) ^| [^British ^nationality ^law ^and ^the ^Republic ^of ^Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nationality_law_and_the_Republic_of_Ireland) ^| [^Ned ^Myers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ned_Myers) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to\u003dautowikibot\u0026amp;subject\u003dAutoWikibot NSFW toggle\u0026amp;message\u003d%2Btoggle-nsfw+cr2kyus) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to\u003dautowikibot\u0026amp;subject\u003dAutoWikibot Deletion\u0026amp;message\u003d%2Bdelete+cr2kyus)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","duration":"","id":7,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_cr2kyus","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":5,"links":[4],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"gurdijak","label":"They would be [\u0027British Subjects\u0027](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_subject).","duration":"","id":5,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cr2kx2t","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":4,"links":[3],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"wenchette","label":"If someone was born in a colony, were they automatically British citizens?","duration":"","id":4,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_cquexnd","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":3,"links":[2],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"dejahthoris22","label":"By the way, his father was not Kenyan, either.
