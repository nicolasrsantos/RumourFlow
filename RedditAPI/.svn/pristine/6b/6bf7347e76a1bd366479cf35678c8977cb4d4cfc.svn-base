I think people are seduced by the ubiquity of information, and so value quantity over quality. \n\nI find a very useful way to handle such a debate style is to simply ask \"What one piece of evidence do you find especially convincing?\" If they provide it to you, and you disprove it, it\u0027s a massive blow.\n\nMore likely, they say \"It\u0027s not one piece of evidence, it\u0027s all the little pieces that add up to a big picture!\" and that should signal to you the person isn\u0027t truly interested in debating their position. Almost all fields of legitimate scientific inquiry have one or two crucial pieces of evidence which, if falsified, would undermine the entire theory or at least require it to undergo revision. Conspiracy theories tend to be constructed with large amounts of flimsy evidence that only take structure after a narrative is projected onto them. Any specific piece of evidence, like say, thermite being found in the WTC rubble, is only compelling if you accept all the preceding flimsy evidence and theories it relies upon.

Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous.

Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430616527E9,"simScore":0.6397451164164103,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430616527E9,"simScore":0.611883107132585,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430632573E9,"simScore":0.5991662740990946,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430633796E9,"simScore":0.6555499989861324,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":9,"links":[7],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"LordKwik","label":"I think the problem everyone here is missing is that in order to be a conspiracy, you need to have something unproven.

Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view.

If we somehow really did get into the debate (lol), then the people trying to re-prove the moon landing would not cite these bogus \"facts\" as the underpinnings for their beliefs.

I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there.

As someone who lost your skepticism of 9/11, and very capable of clear, convincing, and thoughtful writing, maybe you could help me lose my skepticism too.  Like I already agree with you on most of your points...I too don\u0027t give much credence to stuff like analyzing the Pentagon debris or alleged experts talking about building structures.\n\n1)  Key members of the Commission say they were lied to and that the whole project was underfunded.  While this in no way proves a conspiracy, it does pretty much prove we don\u0027t know the whole story.  I admit the most likely explanation is the Bush Admin. was trying to cover up their mistakes and incompetence, but either way what we all consider the \"official story\" almost certainly is incomplete (at best).  Plus, the commission report has a huge section redacted.\n\n2)  I don\u0027t understand how the most powerful military in the history of everything allowed a direct strike on its headquarters without raising a single defense.\n\n3)  The attacks would not have been possible without the war games going on regarding multiple hijackings.  That a never-seen-before type of attack happened at the exact same time we were drilling for that never-seen-before type of attack is very hard to swallow as a coincidence.\n\n4)  I too am very skeptical of random internet claims, so maybe these are complete fabrications, but I haven\u0027t seen them completely debunked.  I\u0027m talking specifically that the Administration quit flying commercially a month before 9/11, that they took the anti-Anthrax pill right before 9/11, that Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon lost billions of dollars of unaccounted money right before 9/11, that several of the hijackers lived right down the street from NSA headquarters, that many other countries warned us about it beforehand, other high-jackers appeared to live lives completely in contrast to that of a devout Muslim, that a bunch of people with Mossad ties were caught filming and celebrating the attacks, Sibel Edmonds\u0027 claims, etc. etc.\n\nWhile obviously I don\u0027t expect anyone to go through every single point, I do wonder if there is a good clear reason to not be concerned with stuff like this at all.\n\n5)  I think we do know with reasonable certainty that the FBI stopped local agents from investigating future hijackers.  We also have pretty reliable testimony that rejected visas for these hijackers were reversed from higher ups.  We also know that the PATRIOT Act appeared fully written at mind-blowing speed.  Should either of these facts cause me to be suspicious?\n\n6)  WTC7 is not mentioned a single time in the entire commission report.  Maybe this was just a big-time fuck up of epic proportions, who knows?  Seems like there are a thousand things about that day that are simply written off as big-time fuck ups of epic proportions.  How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.  It\u0027s getting hard to see how this many years later, revealing this information would still put active spies at risk or otherwise legitimately threaten the safety of Americans generally.  For instance, why can\u0027t they release any of the camera angles of the Pentagon attack that would have showed what happened, as opposed to just giving us one video with a blur on it?\n\n8)  Finally, I\u0027ll say the one place I disagreed with you was how you glossed over the \u0027who benefits\u0027 argument.  The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s.

While this in no way proves a conspiracy, it does pretty much prove we don\u0027t know the whole story.  I admit the most likely explanation is the Bush Admin. was trying to cover up their mistakes and incompetence, but either way what we all consider the \"official story\" almost certainly is incomplete (at best).  Plus, the commission report has a huge section redacted.\n\n2)  I don\u0027t understand how the most powerful military in the history of everything allowed a direct strike on its headquarters without raising a single defense.\n\n3)  The attacks would not have been possible without the war games going on regarding multiple hijackings.  That a never-seen-before type of attack happened at the exact same time we were drilling for that never-seen-before type of attack is very hard to swallow as a coincidence.\n\n4)  I too am very skeptical of random internet claims, so maybe these are complete fabrications, but I haven\u0027t seen them completely debunked.  I\u0027m talking specifically that the Administration quit flying commercially a month before 9/11, that they took the anti-Anthrax pill right before 9/11, that Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon lost billions of dollars of unaccounted money right before 9/11, that several of the hijackers lived right down the street from NSA headquarters, that many other countries warned us about it beforehand, other high-jackers appeared to live lives completely in contrast to that of a devout Muslim, that a bunch of people with Mossad ties were caught filming and celebrating the attacks, Sibel Edmonds\u0027 claims, etc. etc.\n\nWhile obviously I don\u0027t expect anyone to go through every single point, I do wonder if there is a good clear reason to not be concerned with stuff like this at all.\n\n5)  I think we do know with reasonable certainty that the FBI stopped local agents from investigating future hijackers.  We also have pretty reliable testimony that rejected visas for these hijackers were reversed from higher ups.  We also know that the PATRIOT Act appeared fully written at mind-blowing speed.  Should either of these facts cause me to be suspicious?\n\n6)  WTC7 is not mentioned a single time in the entire commission report.  Maybe this was just a big-time fuck up of epic proportions, who knows?  Seems like there are a thousand things about that day that are simply written off as big-time fuck ups of epic proportions.  How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.  It\u0027s getting hard to see how this many years later, revealing this information would still put active spies at risk or otherwise legitimately threaten the safety of Americans generally.  For instance, why can\u0027t they release any of the camera angles of the Pentagon attack that would have showed what happened, as opposed to just giving us one video with a blur on it?\n\n8)  Finally, I\u0027ll say the one place I disagreed with you was how you glossed over the \u0027who benefits\u0027 argument.  The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented.

While this in no way proves a conspiracy, it does pretty much prove we don\u0027t know the whole story.  I admit the most likely explanation is the Bush Admin. was trying to cover up their mistakes and incompetence, but either way what we all consider the \"official story\" almost certainly is incomplete (at best).  Plus, the commission report has a huge section redacted.\n\n2)  I don\u0027t understand how the most powerful military in the history of everything allowed a direct strike on its headquarters without raising a single defense.\n\n3)  The attacks would not have been possible without the war games going on regarding multiple hijackings.  That a never-seen-before type of attack happened at the exact same time we were drilling for that never-seen-before type of attack is very hard to swallow as a coincidence.\n\n4)  I too am very skeptical of random internet claims, so maybe these are complete fabrications, but I haven\u0027t seen them completely debunked.  I\u0027m talking specifically that the Administration quit flying commercially a month before 9/11, that they took the anti-Anthrax pill right before 9/11, that Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon lost billions of dollars of unaccounted money right before 9/11, that several of the hijackers lived right down the street from NSA headquarters, that many other countries warned us about it beforehand, other high-jackers appeared to live lives completely in contrast to that of a devout Muslim, that a bunch of people with Mossad ties were caught filming and celebrating the attacks, Sibel Edmonds\u0027 claims, etc. etc.\n\nWhile obviously I don\u0027t expect anyone to go through every single point, I do wonder if there is a good clear reason to not be concerned with stuff like this at all.\n\n5)  I think we do know with reasonable certainty that the FBI stopped local agents from investigating future hijackers.  We also have pretty reliable testimony that rejected visas for these hijackers were reversed from higher ups.  We also know that the PATRIOT Act appeared fully written at mind-blowing speed.  Should either of these facts cause me to be suspicious?\n\n6)  WTC7 is not mentioned a single time in the entire commission report.  Maybe this was just a big-time fuck up of epic proportions, who knows?  Seems like there are a thousand things about that day that are simply written off as big-time fuck ups of epic proportions.  How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.  It\u0027s getting hard to see how this many years later, revealing this information would still put active spies at risk or otherwise legitimately threaten the safety of Americans generally.  For instance, why can\u0027t they release any of the camera angles of the Pentagon attack that would have showed what happened, as opposed to just giving us one video with a blur on it?\n\n8)  Finally, I\u0027ll say the one place I disagreed with you was how you glossed over the \u0027who benefits\u0027 argument.  The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5280537352605774,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.6756111428662729,"sentiment":"  Very positive"},"timestamp":1.430617487E9,"simScore":0.6884000761128077,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430630575E9,"simScore":0.61497306655435,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":22,"links":[19],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"heelspider","label":"Yeah, I admit this may be just one more of the thousands of things which were gross incompetence.

I\u0027m talking specifically that the Administration quit flying commercially a month before 9/11, that they took the anti-Anthrax pill right before 9/11, that Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon lost billions of dollars of unaccounted money right before 9/11, that several of the hijackers lived right down the street from NSA headquarters, that many other countries warned us about it beforehand, other high-jackers appeared to live lives completely in contrast to that of a devout Muslim, that a bunch of people with Mossad ties were caught filming and celebrating the attacks, Sibel Edmonds\u0027 claims, etc. etc.\n\nWhile obviously I don\u0027t expect anyone to go through every single point, I do wonder if there is a good clear reason to not be concerned with stuff like this at all.\n\n5)  I think we do know with reasonable certainty that the FBI stopped local agents from investigating future hijackers.  We also have pretty reliable testimony that rejected visas for these hijackers were reversed from higher ups.  We also know that the PATRIOT Act appeared fully written at mind-blowing speed.  Should either of these facts cause me to be suspicious?\n\n6)  WTC7 is not mentioned a single time in the entire commission report.  Maybe this was just a big-time fuck up of epic proportions, who knows?  Seems like there are a thousand things about that day that are simply written off as big-time fuck ups of epic proportions.  How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.  It\u0027s getting hard to see how this many years later, revealing this information would still put active spies at risk or otherwise legitimately threaten the safety of Americans generally.  For instance, why can\u0027t they release any of the camera angles of the Pentagon attack that would have showed what happened, as opposed to just giving us one video with a blur on it?\n\n8)  Finally, I\u0027ll say the one place I disagreed with you was how you glossed over the \u0027who benefits\u0027 argument.  The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5280537352605774,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.6756111428662729,"sentiment":"  Very positive"},"timestamp":1.430617487E9,"simScore":0.6898792230485997,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430617877E9,"simScore":0.7014829267019266,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":24,"links":[23],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"dastrn","label":"The airport isn\u0027t really even *right next* to DC.

As someone who lost your skepticism of 9/11, and very capable of clear, convincing, and thoughtful writing, maybe you could help me lose my skepticism too.  Like I already agree with you on most of your points...I too don\u0027t give much credence to stuff like analyzing the Pentagon debris or alleged experts talking about building structures.\n\n1)  Key members of the Commission say they were lied to and that the whole project was underfunded.  While this in no way proves a conspiracy, it does pretty much prove we don\u0027t know the whole story.  I admit the most likely explanation is the Bush Admin. was trying to cover up their mistakes and incompetence, but either way what we all consider the \"official story\" almost certainly is incomplete (at best).  Plus, the commission report has a huge section redacted.\n\n2)  I don\u0027t understand how the most powerful military in the history of everything allowed a direct strike on its headquarters without raising a single defense.\n\n3)  The attacks would not have been possible without the war games going on regarding multiple hijackings.  That a never-seen-before type of attack happened at the exact same time we were drilling for that never-seen-before type of attack is very hard to swallow as a coincidence.\n\n4)  I too am very skeptical of random internet claims, so maybe these are complete fabrications, but I haven\u0027t seen them completely debunked.  I\u0027m talking specifically that the Administration quit flying commercially a month before 9/11, that they took the anti-Anthrax pill right before 9/11, that Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon lost billions of dollars of unaccounted money right before 9/11, that several of the hijackers lived right down the street from NSA headquarters, that many other countries warned us about it beforehand, other high-jackers appeared to live lives completely in contrast to that of a devout Muslim, that a bunch of people with Mossad ties were caught filming and celebrating the attacks, Sibel Edmonds\u0027 claims, etc. etc.\n\nWhile obviously I don\u0027t expect anyone to go through every single point, I do wonder if there is a good clear reason to not be concerned with stuff like this at all.\n\n5)  I think we do know with reasonable certainty that the FBI stopped local agents from investigating future hijackers.  We also have pretty reliable testimony that rejected visas for these hijackers were reversed from higher ups.  We also know that the PATRIOT Act appeared fully written at mind-blowing speed.  Should either of these facts cause me to be suspicious?\n\n6)  WTC7 is not mentioned a single time in the entire commission report.  Maybe this was just a big-time fuck up of epic proportions, who knows?  Seems like there are a thousand things about that day that are simply written off as big-time fuck ups of epic proportions.  How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.  It\u0027s getting hard to see how this many years later, revealing this information would still put active spies at risk or otherwise legitimately threaten the safety of Americans generally.  For instance, why can\u0027t they release any of the camera angles of the Pentagon attack that would have showed what happened, as opposed to just giving us one video with a blur on it?\n\n8)  Finally, I\u0027ll say the one place I disagreed with you was how you glossed over the \u0027who benefits\u0027 argument.  The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5280537352605774,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.6756111428662729,"sentiment":"  Very positive"},"timestamp":1.430617487E9,"simScore":0.6898792230485997,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430617877E9,"simScore":0.7014829267019266,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430619222E9,"simScore":0.6300752236182979,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430635913E9,"simScore":0.6436595767287879,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":26,"links":[25],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"IAmNotYourBoss","label":"If you\u0027re at speed in a 757 that mile can be covered in roughly two seconds.

In short, the claims initially made for war games that seemed to eerily mimic 9/11 on 9/11 either weren\u0027t what people said they were, or did not actually occur on 9/11. They did conduct a war game involving a hijacked airliner, but it was nothing like what occurred on 9/11, so very little confusion actually existed. As you might imagine, the military is quite aware of the concern that an actual attack could coincide with a simulated attack, so they very likely have procedures for dealing with such a scenario. Lastly - and this is me completely hypothesizing - but war games tend to be highly publicized before occurring, presumably to alert other countries to avoid confusion. It\u0027s not out of the question to assume that hijackers shrewdly chose that date in order to help further the chances of success.

It\u0027s hard to imagine someone not leaking some damning classified evidence at some point.\n\n8. The President allowed terrorist attacks to happen so could get reelected? That seems a rather risky campaign move. In hindsight you can say he benefited from it, but before the fact I doubt you could make a good case that being caught off guard during the worst attack on the US in history, while reading *My Pet Goat*, would be a solid path for reelection. Yes of course, corporations or arms of the government involved in defense will get a boost during wartime, but that logic gets you nowhere. It means that every war or precusor to war could be a conspiracy concocted by one or more of these groups. The reality is, the government is filled with people with competing interests, and to allow a terrorist attack of this magnitude to occur would require cooperation and collusion of many branches of the government, which brings you back to the problem of everyone keeping their mouths shut.

Notice all the financial companies. If you buy the conspiracy line, surely some of these well-moneyed \u0027illuminati\u0027 types were privy to the plot. You\u0027d think they would have some objections to a plot that would kill their employees and destroy their offices. What about airline companies? What about hedge fund and mutual fund managers who watched the stock market plummet? Why wasn\u0027t their *more* anomalous trading? Isn\u0027t that evidence against it? No, it\u0027s neither evidence for or against anything - at best it\u0027s a reason to open inquiries, but not a sufficient basis to sustain them.\n\nIt would be trivial for me to open any newspaper, look at the crimes that occurred that preceding day, and find people who benefited from them. Should every person who gets an insurance payout when their spouse dies be investigated? That\u0027s about as clear a connection between a tragedy and beneficiary as one can find. And it requires no collusion, so no concerns about loose lips. Of course, the vast majority of these deaths involve no foul play. What about the recent plane crash in Germany? Surely it was actually sabotage by a competing airline. The flight recorder data must have been falsified, as well as his psychiatric data, which of course means his psychiatrist was payed off. \n\nThis is the basic flaw with conspiracy theories: they presuppose a conclusion, and then find all evidence, no matter how flimsy, to prove them. If the evidence doesn\u0027t exist, then you merely need make your theory unfalsifiable, by imagining perpetrators so diabolically cunning they would make a James Bond villain blush, yet simultaneously and paradoxically, leave enough pieces of evidence around that any internet detective could crack the case.\n\nSorry if I came off insulting in that last paragraph, but at a certain point one loses the ability to be reasonable about these things.

As someone who lost your skepticism of 9/11, and very capable of clear, convincing, and thoughtful writing, maybe you could help me lose my skepticism too.  Like I already agree with you on most of your points...I too don\u0027t give much credence to stuff like analyzing the Pentagon debris or alleged experts talking about building structures.\n\n1)  Key members of the Commission say they were lied to and that the whole project was underfunded.  While this in no way proves a conspiracy, it does pretty much prove we don\u0027t know the whole story.  I admit the most likely explanation is the Bush Admin. was trying to cover up their mistakes and incompetence, but either way what we all consider the \"official story\" almost certainly is incomplete (at best).  Plus, the commission report has a huge section redacted.\n\n2)  I don\u0027t understand how the most powerful military in the history of everything allowed a direct strike on its headquarters without raising a single defense.\n\n3)  The attacks would not have been possible without the war games going on regarding multiple hijackings.  That a never-seen-before type of attack happened at the exact same time we were drilling for that never-seen-before type of attack is very hard to swallow as a coincidence.\n\n4)  I too am very skeptical of random internet claims, so maybe these are complete fabrications, but I haven\u0027t seen them completely debunked.  I\u0027m talking specifically that the Administration quit flying commercially a month before 9/11, that they took the anti-Anthrax pill right before 9/11, that Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon lost billions of dollars of unaccounted money right before 9/11, that several of the hijackers lived right down the street from NSA headquarters, that many other countries warned us about it beforehand, other high-jackers appeared to live lives completely in contrast to that of a devout Muslim, that a bunch of people with Mossad ties were caught filming and celebrating the attacks, Sibel Edmonds\u0027 claims, etc. etc.\n\nWhile obviously I don\u0027t expect anyone to go through every single point, I do wonder if there is a good clear reason to not be concerned with stuff like this at all.\n\n5)  I think we do know with reasonable certainty that the FBI stopped local agents from investigating future hijackers.  We also have pretty reliable testimony that rejected visas for these hijackers were reversed from higher ups.  We also know that the PATRIOT Act appeared fully written at mind-blowing speed.  Should either of these facts cause me to be suspicious?\n\n6)  WTC7 is not mentioned a single time in the entire commission report.  Maybe this was just a big-time fuck up of epic proportions, who knows?  Seems like there are a thousand things about that day that are simply written off as big-time fuck ups of epic proportions.  How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.  It\u0027s getting hard to see how this many years later, revealing this information would still put active spies at risk or otherwise legitimately threaten the safety of Americans generally.  For instance, why can\u0027t they release any of the camera angles of the Pentagon attack that would have showed what happened, as opposed to just giving us one video with a blur on it?\n\n8)  Finally, I\u0027ll say the one place I disagreed with you was how you glossed over the \u0027who benefits\u0027 argument.  The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5280537352605774,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5623804407171877,"sentiment":"  Very positive"},{"index":28,"links":[27],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"heelspider","label":"\u0026amp;#8710; Thanks, that was a really good post and did at least change my views on some of the stuff; particularly the war game link.  (Still it almost brings me farther down the rabbit hole.  If these war games weren\u0027t responsible for our inability to track hijacked planes and our lack of available fighters to scramble - as I was led to believe - then it makes our inability to do these things even more inexcusable.)\n\nThat was an interesting comparison to the housing collapse.  Like 9/11, those responsible for causing/preventing it gained tremendously while everyone else lost out.  Maybe that\u0027s the problem with the whole debate...does it really matter if tragedies were intentional or merely a felix culpa?  Or to put it another way, if failing to do one\u0027s job properly leads to great gains, doesn\u0027t that incentivize performance failure whether or not it was consciously intentional?  Shouldn\u0027t our outrage, criticism, and concerns be equal either way?  Should self-benefiting incompetence be accepted as a reasonable excuse, and as far as that goes, is self-benefiting incompetence even a legitimate concept?\n\nI am totally on board with the idea that the government by its very nature classifies way too much.  But I think it\u0027s fair to be skeptical of a story when the source of that story withholds valuable information, has a long history of dishonesty, and has at least in some cases lied about the exact events in question.\n\nSo yeah, thanks you\u0027ve definitely lessened my suspicions but have not quelled them entirely.  Just too much relies on this idea that the hijackers were all very competent while the US government was entirely incompetent - - despite having the US government having nearly every advantage.  While it could very well be true that the hijackers pulled off the most risky caper in history while the US suffered failure after failure after failure, on its face it feels unlikely to me.\n\n\u0026gt; This is the basic flaw with conspiracy theories: they presuppose a conclusion, and then find all evidence, no matter how flimsy, to prove them. \n\nAs much as I appreciated the rest of your post, this one missed its mark.  Not because I found it insulting, but because it was a fundamental misunderstanding of my position.  I\u0027m not saying a conspiracy necessarily existed, and I\u0027m certainly not advocating any particular narrative of events.  I\u0027m the opposite of what you are saying - - I oppose the presumed conclusion (that the government story is 100% true) and I reject how any flimsy evidence is regarded as proof.  (For instance, does any reasonable person really believe the story they found a hijacker\u0027s passport in tact in the 9/11 ruins?  That can\u0027t possibly be legit.)  My position is simply that this is one of the most important events in modern history and has never been properly investigated.  Never.  Given those circumstances, it seems foolish to go around believing any version of events with reasonable certainty.\n\n\u0026gt;  by imagining perpetrators so diabolically cunning they would make a James Bond villain blush,\n\nThis is where anti-conspiracy people hold a double standard.  There\u0027s no explanation for the events of 9/11 that doesn\u0027t involve diabolical cunning.  You can\u0027t say a flaw in one theory is that involves diabolic cunning when the theory you support also involves diabolical cunning.\n\nAnyhow, again, thanks for the thoughtful response and it did make me rethink a number of things.","duration":"","id":28,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cqwcxng","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":27,"links":[18],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"I\u0027ll try briefly responding to each of your points.

But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5280537352605774,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5623804407171877,"sentiment":"  Very positive"},"timestamp":1.430626987E9,"simScore":0.6013658160561401,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":29,"links":[28],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"huadpe","label":"If the post changed your view, even partially, you should award a delta.","duration":"","id":29,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_cqwczh3","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":28,"links":[27],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"heelspider","label":"\u0026amp;#8710; Thanks, that was a really good post and did at least change my views on some of the stuff; particularly the war game link.  (Still it almost brings me farther down the rabbit hole.  If these war games weren\u0027t responsible for our inability to track hijacked planes and our lack of available fighters to scramble - as I was led to believe - then it makes our inability to do these things even more inexcusable.)\n\nThat was an interesting comparison to the housing collapse.  Like 9/11, those responsible for causing/preventing it gained tremendously while everyone else lost out.  Maybe that\u0027s the problem with the whole debate...does it really matter if tragedies were intentional or merely a felix culpa?  Or to put it another way, if failing to do one\u0027s job properly leads to great gains, doesn\u0027t that incentivize performance failure whether or not it was consciously intentional?  Shouldn\u0027t our outrage, criticism, and concerns be equal either way?  Should self-benefiting incompetence be accepted as a reasonable excuse, and as far as that goes, is self-benefiting incompetence even a legitimate concept?\n\nI am totally on board with the idea that the government by its very nature classifies way too much.  But I think it\u0027s fair to be skeptical of a story when the source of that story withholds valuable information, has a long history of dishonesty, and has at least in some cases lied about the exact events in question.\n\nSo yeah, thanks you\u0027ve definitely lessened my suspicions but have not quelled them entirely.  Just too much relies on this idea that the hijackers were all very competent while the US government was entirely incompetent - - despite having the US government having nearly every advantage.  While it could very well be true that the hijackers pulled off the most risky caper in history while the US suffered failure after failure after failure, on its face it feels unlikely to me.\n\n\u0026gt; This is the basic flaw with conspiracy theories: they presuppose a conclusion, and then find all evidence, no matter how flimsy, to prove them. \n\nAs much as I appreciated the rest of your post, this one missed its mark.  Not because I found it insulting, but because it was a fundamental misunderstanding of my position.  I\u0027m not saying a conspiracy necessarily existed, and I\u0027m certainly not advocating any particular narrative of events.  I\u0027m the opposite of what you are saying - - I oppose the presumed conclusion (that the government story is 100% true) and I reject how any flimsy evidence is regarded as proof.  (For instance, does any reasonable person really believe the story they found a hijacker\u0027s passport in tact in the 9/11 ruins?  That can\u0027t possibly be legit.)  My position is simply that this is one of the most important events in modern history and has never been properly investigated.  Never.  Given those circumstances, it seems foolish to go around believing any version of events with reasonable certainty.\n\n\u0026gt;  by imagining perpetrators so diabolically cunning they would make a James Bond villain blush,\n\nThis is where anti-conspiracy people hold a double standard.  There\u0027s no explanation for the events of 9/11 that doesn\u0027t involve diabolical cunning.  You can\u0027t say a flaw in one theory is that involves diabolic cunning when the theory you support also involves diabolical cunning.\n\nAnyhow, again, thanks for the thoughtful response and it did make me rethink a number of things.","duration":"","id":28,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cqwcxng","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":27,"links":[18],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"I\u0027ll try briefly responding to each of your points. I feel like the only way you can really be convinced is to review some of the sites I linked as they are pretty thorough and well-researched.\n\n1. As you say, it is more plausible to assume negligence over malevolence. 9/11 was, from the governments perspective, a catastrophic fuck up on their part. I have no doubt that on 9/11 when it became clear that this was not some terrible accident but in fact a terrorist attack, politicians of all levels went into complete CYA (cover your ass) mode. Just look at the Benghazi incident - orders of magnitude less impactful than 9/11, but all the same CYA behavior in full display. The 9/11 Commission was undoubtedly seen as a threat to those in power, and highly politicized as a result. Sadly, this tends to be the rule rather than the exception.\n\n2. You could say the same thing about the housing collapse. After the fact it seemed obviously preventable. Credit default swaps in hindsight seem as if they were designed by a mad man, yet before the event they were heralded as an amazing innovation in risk management. History is filled with these \u0027black swan\u0027 moments, and it\u0027s no surprise they are a hotbed of conspiracy theories. They seemingly come from nowhere and have an enormous effect. It would be strange if there *weren\u0027t* anomalies or suspicious qualities to them. If they weren\u0027t anomalous they wouldn\u0027t be a black swan event. In the end the cause is always the same: hubris and ignorance in equal parts.\n\n3. The war games were an interesting anomaly, at least on the surface. This is far too large a topic for me to go over in this post, but for an excellent dissection of it, check out this [link](http://www.911myths.com/index.php/War_Games). In short, the claims initially made for war games that seemed to eerily mimic 9/11 on 9/11 either weren\u0027t what people said they were, or did not actually occur on 9/11. They did conduct a war game involving a hijacked airliner, but it was nothing like what occurred on 9/11, so very little confusion actually existed. As you might imagine, the military is quite aware of the concern that an actual attack could coincide with a simulated attack, so they very likely have procedures for dealing with such a scenario. Lastly - and this is me completely hypothesizing - but war games tend to be highly publicized before occurring, presumably to alert other countries to avoid confusion. It\u0027s not out of the question to assume that hijackers shrewdly chose that date in order to help further the chances of success. A far more simple explanation than the government being involved in the attacks.\n\n4. Without looking them up, I can say that the \u0027unaccountable billions of dollars\u0027 claim was disproven. As for the others, they sound like hearsay - not concrete claims or evidence, simply \u0027weird\u0027 stuff. I remember reading about Sibel Edmond\u0027s story, but as I recall, it was more her whistleblowing government incompetence and negligence rather than ever suggesting the attacks were a government plot. \n\n5. You\u0027re going to need produce some sources on this. Doing some looking around, the visa situation seemed fairly typical - mostly tourist or student visas. There appears to be no controversy here, except for some visas being approved when they should been denied. Again, a case where negligence, incompetence, and simply being understaffed for the job, provides a more plausible explanation than collusion in the plot.\n\n6. WTC7 was really only incidental to the attacks. It was damaged by falling debris and uncontrolled fires, then collapsed. To make it anything more than an anomaly, you would have to make a case for why it needed to be demolished in the first place, and how that would have occurred.\n\n7. The government loves classifying things. They will classify entirely innocuous things and have been criticized repeatedly for that. Again, a case of CYA: if it looks like it should be classified, you have more incentive to do it than to not do it. As Snowden showed, however, it only takes one rebellious systems administrator to blow the thing wide open. It\u0027s hard to imagine someone not leaking some damning classified evidence at some point.\n\n8. The President allowed terrorist attacks to happen so could get reelected? That seems a rather risky campaign move. In hindsight you can say he benefited from it, but before the fact I doubt you could make a good case that being caught off guard during the worst attack on the US in history, while reading *My Pet Goat*, would be a solid path for reelection. Yes of course, corporations or arms of the government involved in defense will get a boost during wartime, but that logic gets you nowhere. It means that every war or precusor to war could be a conspiracy concocted by one or more of these groups. The reality is, the government is filled with people with competing interests, and to allow a terrorist attack of this magnitude to occur would require cooperation and collusion of many branches of the government, which brings you back to the problem of everyone keeping their mouths shut. It\u0027s just not very plausible. Moreover, *they don\u0027t need to*  - there is always enough conflict occurring around the globe to justify intelligence and defense spending.\n\nAs for the people affected by the collapse of the towers, just see this [link](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/twintowers/). Notice all the financial companies. If you buy the conspiracy line, surely some of these well-moneyed \u0027illuminati\u0027 types were privy to the plot. You\u0027d think they would have some objections to a plot that would kill their employees and destroy their offices. What about airline companies? What about hedge fund and mutual fund managers who watched the stock market plummet? Why wasn\u0027t their *more* anomalous trading? Isn\u0027t that evidence against it? No, it\u0027s neither evidence for or against anything - at best it\u0027s a reason to open inquiries, but not a sufficient basis to sustain them.\n\nIt would be trivial for me to open any newspaper, look at the crimes that occurred that preceding day, and find people who benefited from them. Should every person who gets an insurance payout when their spouse dies be investigated? That\u0027s about as clear a connection between a tragedy and beneficiary as one can find. And it requires no collusion, so no concerns about loose lips. Of course, the vast majority of these deaths involve no foul play. What about the recent plane crash in Germany? Surely it was actually sabotage by a competing airline. The flight recorder data must have been falsified, as well as his psychiatric data, which of course means his psychiatrist was payed off. \n\nThis is the basic flaw with conspiracy theories: they presuppose a conclusion, and then find all evidence, no matter how flimsy, to prove them. If the evidence doesn\u0027t exist, then you merely need make your theory unfalsifiable, by imagining perpetrators so diabolically cunning they would make a James Bond villain blush, yet simultaneously and paradoxically, leave enough pieces of evidence around that any internet detective could crack the case.\n\nSorry if I came off insulting in that last paragraph, but at a certain point one loses the ability to be reasonable about these things.

So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5280537352605774,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5623804407171877,"sentiment":"  Very positive"},"timestamp":1.430626987E9,"simScore":0.6013658160561401,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430629374E9,"simScore":0.7223624702020892,"sentiment":"  Positive"},{"index":30,"links":[29],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"heelspider","label":"I definitely considered it.

Like 9/11, those responsible for causing/preventing it gained tremendously while everyone else lost out.  Maybe that\u0027s the problem with the whole debate...does it really matter if tragedies were intentional or merely a felix culpa?  Or to put it another way, if failing to do one\u0027s job properly leads to great gains, doesn\u0027t that incentivize performance failure whether or not it was consciously intentional?  Shouldn\u0027t our outrage, criticism, and concerns be equal either way?  Should self-benefiting incompetence be accepted as a reasonable excuse, and as far as that goes, is self-benefiting incompetence even a legitimate concept?\n\nI am totally on board with the idea that the government by its very nature classifies way too much.  But I think it\u0027s fair to be skeptical of a story when the source of that story withholds valuable information, has a long history of dishonesty, and has at least in some cases lied about the exact events in question.\n\nSo yeah, thanks you\u0027ve definitely lessened my suspicions but have not quelled them entirely.  Just too much relies on this idea that the hijackers were all very competent while the US government was entirely incompetent - - despite having the US government having nearly every advantage.  While it could very well be true that the hijackers pulled off the most risky caper in history while the US suffered failure after failure after failure, on its face it feels unlikely to me.\n\n\u0026gt; This is the basic flaw with conspiracy theories: they presuppose a conclusion, and then find all evidence, no matter how flimsy, to prove them. \n\nAs much as I appreciated the rest of your post, this one missed its mark.  Not because I found it insulting, but because it was a fundamental misunderstanding of my position.  I\u0027m not saying a conspiracy necessarily existed, and I\u0027m certainly not advocating any particular narrative of events.  I\u0027m the opposite of what you are saying - - I oppose the presumed conclusion (that the government story is 100% true) and I reject how any flimsy evidence is regarded as proof.  (For instance, does any reasonable person really believe the story they found a hijacker\u0027s passport in tact in the 9/11 ruins?  That can\u0027t possibly be legit.)  My position is simply that this is one of the most important events in modern history and has never been properly investigated.  Never.  Given those circumstances, it seems foolish to go around believing any version of events with reasonable certainty.\n\n\u0026gt;  by imagining perpetrators so diabolically cunning they would make a James Bond villain blush,\n\nThis is where anti-conspiracy people hold a double standard.  There\u0027s no explanation for the events of 9/11 that doesn\u0027t involve diabolical cunning.  You can\u0027t say a flaw in one theory is that involves diabolic cunning when the theory you support also involves diabolical cunning.\n\nAnyhow, again, thanks for the thoughtful response and it did make me rethink a number of things.","duration":"","id":28,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cqwcxng","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":27,"links":[18],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"I\u0027ll try briefly responding to each of your points. I feel like the only way you can really be convinced is to review some of the sites I linked as they are pretty thorough and well-researched.\n\n1. As you say, it is more plausible to assume negligence over malevolence. 9/11 was, from the governments perspective, a catastrophic fuck up on their part. I have no doubt that on 9/11 when it became clear that this was not some terrible accident but in fact a terrorist attack, politicians of all levels went into complete CYA (cover your ass) mode. Just look at the Benghazi incident - orders of magnitude less impactful than 9/11, but all the same CYA behavior in full display. The 9/11 Commission was undoubtedly seen as a threat to those in power, and highly politicized as a result. Sadly, this tends to be the rule rather than the exception.\n\n2. You could say the same thing about the housing collapse. After the fact it seemed obviously preventable. Credit default swaps in hindsight seem as if they were designed by a mad man, yet before the event they were heralded as an amazing innovation in risk management. History is filled with these \u0027black swan\u0027 moments, and it\u0027s no surprise they are a hotbed of conspiracy theories. They seemingly come from nowhere and have an enormous effect. It would be strange if there *weren\u0027t* anomalies or suspicious qualities to them. If they weren\u0027t anomalous they wouldn\u0027t be a black swan event. In the end the cause is always the same: hubris and ignorance in equal parts.\n\n3. The war games were an interesting anomaly, at least on the surface. This is far too large a topic for me to go over in this post, but for an excellent dissection of it, check out this [link](http://www.911myths.com/index.php/War_Games). In short, the claims initially made for war games that seemed to eerily mimic 9/11 on 9/11 either weren\u0027t what people said they were, or did not actually occur on 9/11. They did conduct a war game involving a hijacked airliner, but it was nothing like what occurred on 9/11, so very little confusion actually existed. As you might imagine, the military is quite aware of the concern that an actual attack could coincide with a simulated attack, so they very likely have procedures for dealing with such a scenario. Lastly - and this is me completely hypothesizing - but war games tend to be highly publicized before occurring, presumably to alert other countries to avoid confusion. It\u0027s not out of the question to assume that hijackers shrewdly chose that date in order to help further the chances of success. A far more simple explanation than the government being involved in the attacks.\n\n4. Without looking them up, I can say that the \u0027unaccountable billions of dollars\u0027 claim was disproven. As for the others, they sound like hearsay - not concrete claims or evidence, simply \u0027weird\u0027 stuff. I remember reading about Sibel Edmond\u0027s story, but as I recall, it was more her whistleblowing government incompetence and negligence rather than ever suggesting the attacks were a government plot. \n\n5. You\u0027re going to need produce some sources on this. Doing some looking around, the visa situation seemed fairly typical - mostly tourist or student visas. There appears to be no controversy here, except for some visas being approved when they should been denied. Again, a case where negligence, incompetence, and simply being understaffed for the job, provides a more plausible explanation than collusion in the plot.\n\n6. WTC7 was really only incidental to the attacks. It was damaged by falling debris and uncontrolled fires, then collapsed. To make it anything more than an anomaly, you would have to make a case for why it needed to be demolished in the first place, and how that would have occurred.\n\n7. The government loves classifying things. They will classify entirely innocuous things and have been criticized repeatedly for that. Again, a case of CYA: if it looks like it should be classified, you have more incentive to do it than to not do it. As Snowden showed, however, it only takes one rebellious systems administrator to blow the thing wide open. It\u0027s hard to imagine someone not leaking some damning classified evidence at some point.\n\n8. The President allowed terrorist attacks to happen so could get reelected? That seems a rather risky campaign move. In hindsight you can say he benefited from it, but before the fact I doubt you could make a good case that being caught off guard during the worst attack on the US in history, while reading *My Pet Goat*, would be a solid path for reelection. Yes of course, corporations or arms of the government involved in defense will get a boost during wartime, but that logic gets you nowhere. It means that every war or precusor to war could be a conspiracy concocted by one or more of these groups. The reality is, the government is filled with people with competing interests, and to allow a terrorist attack of this magnitude to occur would require cooperation and collusion of many branches of the government, which brings you back to the problem of everyone keeping their mouths shut. It\u0027s just not very plausible. Moreover, *they don\u0027t need to*  - there is always enough conflict occurring around the globe to justify intelligence and defense spending.\n\nAs for the people affected by the collapse of the towers, just see this [link](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/twintowers/). Notice all the financial companies. If you buy the conspiracy line, surely some of these well-moneyed \u0027illuminati\u0027 types were privy to the plot. You\u0027d think they would have some objections to a plot that would kill their employees and destroy their offices. What about airline companies? What about hedge fund and mutual fund managers who watched the stock market plummet? Why wasn\u0027t their *more* anomalous trading? Isn\u0027t that evidence against it? No, it\u0027s neither evidence for or against anything - at best it\u0027s a reason to open inquiries, but not a sufficient basis to sustain them.\n\nIt would be trivial for me to open any newspaper, look at the crimes that occurred that preceding day, and find people who benefited from them. Should every person who gets an insurance payout when their spouse dies be investigated? That\u0027s about as clear a connection between a tragedy and beneficiary as one can find. And it requires no collusion, so no concerns about loose lips. Of course, the vast majority of these deaths involve no foul play. What about the recent plane crash in Germany? Surely it was actually sabotage by a competing airline. The flight recorder data must have been falsified, as well as his psychiatric data, which of course means his psychiatrist was payed off. \n\nThis is the basic flaw with conspiracy theories: they presuppose a conclusion, and then find all evidence, no matter how flimsy, to prove them. If the evidence doesn\u0027t exist, then you merely need make your theory unfalsifiable, by imagining perpetrators so diabolically cunning they would make a James Bond villain blush, yet simultaneously and paradoxically, leave enough pieces of evidence around that any internet detective could crack the case.\n\nSorry if I came off insulting in that last paragraph, but at a certain point one loses the ability to be reasonable about these things. I realize I didn\u0027t get to everything you mentioned, but in the end the only thing that can change your view is yourself, and it takes work. Please for God\u0027s sake don\u0027t make this time I spent on a lovely Saturday afternoon meaningless by going down a rabbit hole of nano-thermite and missle pods. *You\u0027re better than that.*","duration":"","id":27,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_cqwbt0m","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":18,"links":[1],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"heelspider","label":"I really enjoyed your post.  As someone who lost your skepticism of 9/11, and very capable of clear, convincing, and thoughtful writing, maybe you could help me lose my skepticism too.  Like I already agree with you on most of your points...I too don\u0027t give much credence to stuff like analyzing the Pentagon debris or alleged experts talking about building structures.\n\n1)  Key members of the Commission say they were lied to and that the whole project was underfunded.  While this in no way proves a conspiracy, it does pretty much prove we don\u0027t know the whole story.  I admit the most likely explanation is the Bush Admin. was trying to cover up their mistakes and incompetence, but either way what we all consider the \"official story\" almost certainly is incomplete (at best).  Plus, the commission report has a huge section redacted.\n\n2)  I don\u0027t understand how the most powerful military in the history of everything allowed a direct strike on its headquarters without raising a single defense.\n\n3)  The attacks would not have been possible without the war games going on regarding multiple hijackings.  That a never-seen-before type of attack happened at the exact same time we were drilling for that never-seen-before type of attack is very hard to swallow as a coincidence.\n\n4)  I too am very skeptical of random internet claims, so maybe these are complete fabrications, but I haven\u0027t seen them completely debunked.  I\u0027m talking specifically that the Administration quit flying commercially a month before 9/11, that they took the anti-Anthrax pill right before 9/11, that Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon lost billions of dollars of unaccounted money right before 9/11, that several of the hijackers lived right down the street from NSA headquarters, that many other countries warned us about it beforehand, other high-jackers appeared to live lives completely in contrast to that of a devout Muslim, that a bunch of people with Mossad ties were caught filming and celebrating the attacks, Sibel Edmonds\u0027 claims, etc. etc.\n\nWhile obviously I don\u0027t expect anyone to go through every single point, I do wonder if there is a good clear reason to not be concerned with stuff like this at all.\n\n5)  I think we do know with reasonable certainty that the FBI stopped local agents from investigating future hijackers.  We also have pretty reliable testimony that rejected visas for these hijackers were reversed from higher ups.  We also know that the PATRIOT Act appeared fully written at mind-blowing speed.  Should either of these facts cause me to be suspicious?\n\n6)  WTC7 is not mentioned a single time in the entire commission report.  Maybe this was just a big-time fuck up of epic proportions, who knows?  Seems like there are a thousand things about that day that are simply written off as big-time fuck ups of epic proportions.  How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.  It\u0027s getting hard to see how this many years later, revealing this information would still put active spies at risk or otherwise legitimately threaten the safety of Americans generally.  For instance, why can\u0027t they release any of the camera angles of the Pentagon attack that would have showed what happened, as opposed to just giving us one video with a blur on it?\n\n8)  Finally, I\u0027ll say the one place I disagreed with you was how you glossed over the \u0027who benefits\u0027 argument.  The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet.

Like 9/11, those responsible for causing/preventing it gained tremendously while everyone else lost out.  Maybe that\u0027s the problem with the whole debate...does it really matter if tragedies were intentional or merely a felix culpa?  Or to put it another way, if failing to do one\u0027s job properly leads to great gains, doesn\u0027t that incentivize performance failure whether or not it was consciously intentional?  Shouldn\u0027t our outrage, criticism, and concerns be equal either way?  Should self-benefiting incompetence be accepted as a reasonable excuse, and as far as that goes, is self-benefiting incompetence even a legitimate concept?\n\nI am totally on board with the idea that the government by its very nature classifies way too much.  But I think it\u0027s fair to be skeptical of a story when the source of that story withholds valuable information, has a long history of dishonesty, and has at least in some cases lied about the exact events in question.\n\nSo yeah, thanks you\u0027ve definitely lessened my suspicions but have not quelled them entirely.  Just too much relies on this idea that the hijackers were all very competent while the US government was entirely incompetent - - despite having the US government having nearly every advantage.  While it could very well be true that the hijackers pulled off the most risky caper in history while the US suffered failure after failure after failure, on its face it feels unlikely to me.\n\n\u0026gt; This is the basic flaw with conspiracy theories: they presuppose a conclusion, and then find all evidence, no matter how flimsy, to prove them. \n\nAs much as I appreciated the rest of your post, this one missed its mark.  Not because I found it insulting, but because it was a fundamental misunderstanding of my position.  I\u0027m not saying a conspiracy necessarily existed, and I\u0027m certainly not advocating any particular narrative of events.  I\u0027m the opposite of what you are saying - - I oppose the presumed conclusion (that the government story is 100% true) and I reject how any flimsy evidence is regarded as proof.  (For instance, does any reasonable person really believe the story they found a hijacker\u0027s passport in tact in the 9/11 ruins?  That can\u0027t possibly be legit.)  My position is simply that this is one of the most important events in modern history and has never been properly investigated.  Never.  Given those circumstances, it seems foolish to go around believing any version of events with reasonable certainty.\n\n\u0026gt;  by imagining perpetrators so diabolically cunning they would make a James Bond villain blush,\n\nThis is where anti-conspiracy people hold a double standard.  There\u0027s no explanation for the events of 9/11 that doesn\u0027t involve diabolical cunning.  You can\u0027t say a flaw in one theory is that involves diabolic cunning when the theory you support also involves diabolical cunning.\n\nAnyhow, again, thanks for the thoughtful response and it did make me rethink a number of things.","duration":"","id":28,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cqwcxng","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":27,"links":[18],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"I\u0027ll try briefly responding to each of your points.

As you say, it is more plausible to assume negligence over malevolence. 9/11 was, from the governments perspective, a catastrophic fuck up on their part. I have no doubt that on 9/11 when it became clear that this was not some terrible accident but in fact a terrorist attack, politicians of all levels went into complete CYA (cover your ass) mode. Just look at the Benghazi incident - orders of magnitude less impactful than 9/11, but all the same CYA behavior in full display. The 9/11 Commission was undoubtedly seen as a threat to those in power, and highly politicized as a result. Sadly, this tends to be the rule rather than the exception.\n\n2. You could say the same thing about the housing collapse. After the fact it seemed obviously preventable. Credit default swaps in hindsight seem as if they were designed by a mad man, yet before the event they were heralded as an amazing innovation in risk management. History is filled with these \u0027black swan\u0027 moments, and it\u0027s no surprise they are a hotbed of conspiracy theories. They seemingly come from nowhere and have an enormous effect. It would be strange if there *weren\u0027t* anomalies or suspicious qualities to them. If they weren\u0027t anomalous they wouldn\u0027t be a black swan event. In the end the cause is always the same: hubris and ignorance in equal parts.\n\n3. The war games were an interesting anomaly, at least on the surface. This is far too large a topic for me to go over in this post, but for an excellent dissection of it, check out this [link](http://www.911myths.com/index.php/War_Games). In short, the claims initially made for war games that seemed to eerily mimic 9/11 on 9/11 either weren\u0027t what people said they were, or did not actually occur on 9/11. They did conduct a war game involving a hijacked airliner, but it was nothing like what occurred on 9/11, so very little confusion actually existed. As you might imagine, the military is quite aware of the concern that an actual attack could coincide with a simulated attack, so they very likely have procedures for dealing with such a scenario. Lastly - and this is me completely hypothesizing - but war games tend to be highly publicized before occurring, presumably to alert other countries to avoid confusion. It\u0027s not out of the question to assume that hijackers shrewdly chose that date in order to help further the chances of success. A far more simple explanation than the government being involved in the attacks.\n\n4. Without looking them up, I can say that the \u0027unaccountable billions of dollars\u0027 claim was disproven. As for the others, they sound like hearsay - not concrete claims or evidence, simply \u0027weird\u0027 stuff. I remember reading about Sibel Edmond\u0027s story, but as I recall, it was more her whistleblowing government incompetence and negligence rather than ever suggesting the attacks were a government plot. \n\n5. You\u0027re going to need produce some sources on this. Doing some looking around, the visa situation seemed fairly typical - mostly tourist or student visas. There appears to be no controversy here, except for some visas being approved when they should been denied. Again, a case where negligence, incompetence, and simply being understaffed for the job, provides a more plausible explanation than collusion in the plot.\n\n6. WTC7 was really only incidental to the attacks. It was damaged by falling debris and uncontrolled fires, then collapsed. To make it anything more than an anomaly, you would have to make a case for why it needed to be demolished in the first place, and how that would have occurred.\n\n7. The government loves classifying things. They will classify entirely innocuous things and have been criticized repeatedly for that. Again, a case of CYA: if it looks like it should be classified, you have more incentive to do it than to not do it. As Snowden showed, however, it only takes one rebellious systems administrator to blow the thing wide open. It\u0027s hard to imagine someone not leaking some damning classified evidence at some point.\n\n8. The President allowed terrorist attacks to happen so could get reelected? That seems a rather risky campaign move. In hindsight you can say he benefited from it, but before the fact I doubt you could make a good case that being caught off guard during the worst attack on the US in history, while reading *My Pet Goat*, would be a solid path for reelection. Yes of course, corporations or arms of the government involved in defense will get a boost during wartime, but that logic gets you nowhere. It means that every war or precusor to war could be a conspiracy concocted by one or more of these groups. The reality is, the government is filled with people with competing interests, and to allow a terrorist attack of this magnitude to occur would require cooperation and collusion of many branches of the government, which brings you back to the problem of everyone keeping their mouths shut. It\u0027s just not very plausible. Moreover, *they don\u0027t need to*  - there is always enough conflict occurring around the globe to justify intelligence and defense spending.\n\nAs for the people affected by the collapse of the towers, just see this [link](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/twintowers/). Notice all the financial companies. If you buy the conspiracy line, surely some of these well-moneyed \u0027illuminati\u0027 types were privy to the plot. You\u0027d think they would have some objections to a plot that would kill their employees and destroy their offices. What about airline companies? What about hedge fund and mutual fund managers who watched the stock market plummet? Why wasn\u0027t their *more* anomalous trading? Isn\u0027t that evidence against it? No, it\u0027s neither evidence for or against anything - at best it\u0027s a reason to open inquiries, but not a sufficient basis to sustain them.\n\nIt would be trivial for me to open any newspaper, look at the crimes that occurred that preceding day, and find people who benefited from them. Should every person who gets an insurance payout when their spouse dies be investigated? That\u0027s about as clear a connection between a tragedy and beneficiary as one can find. And it requires no collusion, so no concerns about loose lips. Of course, the vast majority of these deaths involve no foul play. What about the recent plane crash in Germany? Surely it was actually sabotage by a competing airline. The flight recorder data must have been falsified, as well as his psychiatric data, which of course means his psychiatrist was payed off. \n\nThis is the basic flaw with conspiracy theories: they presuppose a conclusion, and then find all evidence, no matter how flimsy, to prove them. If the evidence doesn\u0027t exist, then you merely need make your theory unfalsifiable, by imagining perpetrators so diabolically cunning they would make a James Bond villain blush, yet simultaneously and paradoxically, leave enough pieces of evidence around that any internet detective could crack the case.\n\nSorry if I came off insulting in that last paragraph, but at a certain point one loses the ability to be reasonable about these things. I realize I didn\u0027t get to everything you mentioned, but in the end the only thing that can change your view is yourself, and it takes work. Please for God\u0027s sake don\u0027t make this time I spent on a lovely Saturday afternoon meaningless by going down a rabbit hole of nano-thermite and missle pods. *You\u0027re better than that.*","duration":"","id":27,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_cqwbt0m","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":18,"links":[1],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"heelspider","label":"I really enjoyed your post.  As someone who lost your skepticism of 9/11, and very capable of clear, convincing, and thoughtful writing, maybe you could help me lose my skepticism too.  Like I already agree with you on most of your points...I too don\u0027t give much credence to stuff like analyzing the Pentagon debris or alleged experts talking about building structures.\n\n1)  Key members of the Commission say they were lied to and that the whole project was underfunded.  While this in no way proves a conspiracy, it does pretty much prove we don\u0027t know the whole story.  I admit the most likely explanation is the Bush Admin. was trying to cover up their mistakes and incompetence, but either way what we all consider the \"official story\" almost certainly is incomplete (at best).  Plus, the commission report has a huge section redacted.\n\n2)  I don\u0027t understand how the most powerful military in the history of everything allowed a direct strike on its headquarters without raising a single defense.\n\n3)  The attacks would not have been possible without the war games going on regarding multiple hijackings.  That a never-seen-before type of attack happened at the exact same time we were drilling for that never-seen-before type of attack is very hard to swallow as a coincidence.\n\n4)  I too am very skeptical of random internet claims, so maybe these are complete fabrications, but I haven\u0027t seen them completely debunked.  I\u0027m talking specifically that the Administration quit flying commercially a month before 9/11, that they took the anti-Anthrax pill right before 9/11, that Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon lost billions of dollars of unaccounted money right before 9/11, that several of the hijackers lived right down the street from NSA headquarters, that many other countries warned us about it beforehand, other high-jackers appeared to live lives completely in contrast to that of a devout Muslim, that a bunch of people with Mossad ties were caught filming and celebrating the attacks, Sibel Edmonds\u0027 claims, etc. etc.\n\nWhile obviously I don\u0027t expect anyone to go through every single point, I do wonder if there is a good clear reason to not be concerned with stuff like this at all.\n\n5)  I think we do know with reasonable certainty that the FBI stopped local agents from investigating future hijackers.  We also have pretty reliable testimony that rejected visas for these hijackers were reversed from higher ups.  We also know that the PATRIOT Act appeared fully written at mind-blowing speed.  Should either of these facts cause me to be suspicious?\n\n6)  WTC7 is not mentioned a single time in the entire commission report.  Maybe this was just a big-time fuck up of epic proportions, who knows?  Seems like there are a thousand things about that day that are simply written off as big-time fuck ups of epic proportions.  How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.  It\u0027s getting hard to see how this many years later, revealing this information would still put active spies at risk or otherwise legitimately threaten the safety of Americans generally.  For instance, why can\u0027t they release any of the camera angles of the Pentagon attack that would have showed what happened, as opposed to just giving us one video with a blur on it?\n\n8)  Finally, I\u0027ll say the one place I disagreed with you was how you glossed over the \u0027who benefits\u0027 argument.  The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5280537352605774,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5623804407171877,"sentiment":"  Very positive"},"timestamp":1.430626987E9,"simScore":0.6013658160561401,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430629374E9,"simScore":0.7223624702020892,"sentiment":"  Positive"},"timestamp":1.430629481E9,"simScore":0.6554814784615128,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430629569E9,"simScore":0.6558303479152539,"sentiment":"  Positive"},{"index":32,"links":[31],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"heelspider","label":"Done.

WTC7 was really only incidental to the attacks. It was damaged by falling debris and uncontrolled fires, then collapsed. To make it anything more than an anomaly, you would have to make a case for why it needed to be demolished in the first place, and how that would have occurred.\n\n7. The government loves classifying things. They will classify entirely innocuous things and have been criticized repeatedly for that.

It means that every war or precusor to war could be a conspiracy concocted by one or more of these groups. The reality is, the government is filled with people with competing interests, and to allow a terrorist attack of this magnitude to occur would require cooperation and collusion of many branches of the government, which brings you back to the problem of everyone keeping their mouths shut.

I\u0027m talking specifically that the Administration quit flying commercially a month before 9/11, that they took the anti-Anthrax pill right before 9/11, that Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon lost billions of dollars of unaccounted money right before 9/11, that several of the hijackers lived right down the street from NSA headquarters, that many other countries warned us about it beforehand, other high-jackers appeared to live lives completely in contrast to that of a devout Muslim, that a bunch of people with Mossad ties were caught filming and celebrating the attacks, Sibel Edmonds\u0027 claims, etc. etc.\n\nWhile obviously I don\u0027t expect anyone to go through every single point, I do wonder if there is a good clear reason to not be concerned with stuff like this at all.\n\n5)  I think we do know with reasonable certainty that the FBI stopped local agents from investigating future hijackers.  We also have pretty reliable testimony that rejected visas for these hijackers were reversed from higher ups.  We also know that the PATRIOT Act appeared fully written at mind-blowing speed.  Should either of these facts cause me to be suspicious?\n\n6)  WTC7 is not mentioned a single time in the entire commission report.  Maybe this was just a big-time fuck up of epic proportions, who knows?  Seems like there are a thousand things about that day that are simply written off as big-time fuck ups of epic proportions.  How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.  It\u0027s getting hard to see how this many years later, revealing this information would still put active spies at risk or otherwise legitimately threaten the safety of Americans generally.  For instance, why can\u0027t they release any of the camera angles of the Pentagon attack that would have showed what happened, as opposed to just giving us one video with a blur on it?\n\n8)  Finally, I\u0027ll say the one place I disagreed with you was how you glossed over the \u0027who benefits\u0027 argument.  The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5280537352605774,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5623804407171877,"sentiment":"  Very positive"},"timestamp":1.430626987E9,"simScore":0.6013658160561401,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430629374E9,"simScore":0.7223624702020892,"sentiment":"  Positive"},"timestamp":1.430629481E9,"simScore":0.6554814784615128,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430629569E9,"simScore":0.6558303479152539,"sentiment":"  Positive"},"timestamp":1.430629746E9,"simScore":0.7278022159927109,"sentiment":"  Positive"},{"index":33,"links":[28],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"life_is_like_a_sewer","label":"\u0026gt;So yeah, thanks you\u0027ve definitely lessened my suspicions but have not quelled them entirely.

The three successful hijacked planes all struck within an hour of one another, with the longest period between hijacking and impact being one hour and 17 minutes. Since the hijackers turned off the transponders on the planes, finding them on radar would be the equivalent of finding 3 needles within a 4,500 needle haystack. Also, hijackings had never been used as a method of suicide attack, so there was no protocol to intercept planes over US airspace even if they did find them in time. All in all, pulling off the attacks required very little skill on the part of the hijackers, because the US had no advantages, only disadvantages.

Like 9/11, those responsible for causing/preventing it gained tremendously while everyone else lost out.  Maybe that\u0027s the problem with the whole debate...does it really matter if tragedies were intentional or merely a felix culpa?  Or to put it another way, if failing to do one\u0027s job properly leads to great gains, doesn\u0027t that incentivize performance failure whether or not it was consciously intentional?

I\u0027m the opposite of what you are saying - - I oppose the presumed conclusion (that the government story is 100% true) and I reject how any flimsy evidence is regarded as proof.  (For instance, does any reasonable person really believe the story they found a hijacker\u0027s passport in tact in the 9/11 ruins?  That can\u0027t possibly be legit.)  My position is simply that this is one of the most important events in modern history and has never been properly investigated.  Never.  Given those circumstances, it seems foolish to go around believing any version of events with reasonable certainty.\n\n\u0026gt;  by imagining perpetrators so diabolically cunning they would make a James Bond villain blush,\n\nThis is where anti-conspiracy people hold a double standard.  There\u0027s no explanation for the events of 9/11 that doesn\u0027t involve diabolical cunning.  You can\u0027t say a flaw in one theory is that involves diabolic cunning when the theory you support also involves diabolical cunning.\n\nAnyhow, again, thanks for the thoughtful response and it did make me rethink a number of things.","duration":"","id":28,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cqwcxng","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":27,"links":[18],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"I\u0027ll try briefly responding to each of your points. I feel like the only way you can really be convinced is to review some of the sites I linked as they are pretty thorough and well-researched.\n\n1. As you say, it is more plausible to assume negligence over malevolence. 9/11 was, from the governments perspective, a catastrophic fuck up on their part. I have no doubt that on 9/11 when it became clear that this was not some terrible accident but in fact a terrorist attack, politicians of all levels went into complete CYA (cover your ass) mode. Just look at the Benghazi incident - orders of magnitude less impactful than 9/11, but all the same CYA behavior in full display. The 9/11 Commission was undoubtedly seen as a threat to those in power, and highly politicized as a result. Sadly, this tends to be the rule rather than the exception.\n\n2. You could say the same thing about the housing collapse. After the fact it seemed obviously preventable. Credit default swaps in hindsight seem as if they were designed by a mad man, yet before the event they were heralded as an amazing innovation in risk management. History is filled with these \u0027black swan\u0027 moments, and it\u0027s no surprise they are a hotbed of conspiracy theories. They seemingly come from nowhere and have an enormous effect. It would be strange if there *weren\u0027t* anomalies or suspicious qualities to them. If they weren\u0027t anomalous they wouldn\u0027t be a black swan event. In the end the cause is always the same: hubris and ignorance in equal parts.\n\n3. The war games were an interesting anomaly, at least on the surface. This is far too large a topic for me to go over in this post, but for an excellent dissection of it, check out this [link](http://www.911myths.com/index.php/War_Games). In short, the claims initially made for war games that seemed to eerily mimic 9/11 on 9/11 either weren\u0027t what people said they were, or did not actually occur on 9/11. They did conduct a war game involving a hijacked airliner, but it was nothing like what occurred on 9/11, so very little confusion actually existed. As you might imagine, the military is quite aware of the concern that an actual attack could coincide with a simulated attack, so they very likely have procedures for dealing with such a scenario. Lastly - and this is me completely hypothesizing - but war games tend to be highly publicized before occurring, presumably to alert other countries to avoid confusion. It\u0027s not out of the question to assume that hijackers shrewdly chose that date in order to help further the chances of success. A far more simple explanation than the government being involved in the attacks.\n\n4. Without looking them up, I can say that the \u0027unaccountable billions of dollars\u0027 claim was disproven. As for the others, they sound like hearsay - not concrete claims or evidence, simply \u0027weird\u0027 stuff. I remember reading about Sibel Edmond\u0027s story, but as I recall, it was more her whistleblowing government incompetence and negligence rather than ever suggesting the attacks were a government plot. \n\n5. You\u0027re going to need produce some sources on this. Doing some looking around, the visa situation seemed fairly typical - mostly tourist or student visas. There appears to be no controversy here, except for some visas being approved when they should been denied. Again, a case where negligence, incompetence, and simply being understaffed for the job, provides a more plausible explanation than collusion in the plot.\n\n6. WTC7 was really only incidental to the attacks. It was damaged by falling debris and uncontrolled fires, then collapsed.

I\u0027m talking specifically that the Administration quit flying commercially a month before 9/11, that they took the anti-Anthrax pill right before 9/11, that Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon lost billions of dollars of unaccounted money right before 9/11, that several of the hijackers lived right down the street from NSA headquarters, that many other countries warned us about it beforehand, other high-jackers appeared to live lives completely in contrast to that of a devout Muslim, that a bunch of people with Mossad ties were caught filming and celebrating the attacks, Sibel Edmonds\u0027 claims, etc. etc.\n\nWhile obviously I don\u0027t expect anyone to go through every single point, I do wonder if there is a good clear reason to not be concerned with stuff like this at all.\n\n5)  I think we do know with reasonable certainty that the FBI stopped local agents from investigating future hijackers.  We also have pretty reliable testimony that rejected visas for these hijackers were reversed from higher ups.  We also know that the PATRIOT Act appeared fully written at mind-blowing speed.  Should either of these facts cause me to be suspicious?\n\n6)  WTC7 is not mentioned a single time in the entire commission report.  Maybe this was just a big-time fuck up of epic proportions, who knows?  Seems like there are a thousand things about that day that are simply written off as big-time fuck ups of epic proportions.  How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.  It\u0027s getting hard to see how this many years later, revealing this information would still put active spies at risk or otherwise legitimately threaten the safety of Americans generally.  For instance, why can\u0027t they release any of the camera angles of the Pentagon attack that would have showed what happened, as opposed to just giving us one video with a blur on it?\n\n8)  Finally, I\u0027ll say the one place I disagreed with you was how you glossed over the \u0027who benefits\u0027 argument.  The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5280537352605774,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5623804407171877,"sentiment":"  Very positive"},"timestamp":1.430626987E9,"simScore":0.6013658160561401,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430629374E9,"simScore":0.5556711261232484,"sentiment":"  Positive"},{"index":34,"links":[33],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"heelspider","label":"All the terrorists had to do was get American visas despite their terrorist affiliations, learn to become expert commercial jet pilots with just a few lessons on a single-engine plane, sneak weapons through airport security without a single person getting caught, hope like hell no one in global intelligence notices at all this whole time, hope like hell the policy of intercepting hijack planes will get dropped before the operation happens, and finally, hope every other minor detail goes your way without a hitch.

The three successful hijacked planes all struck within an hour of one another, with the longest period between hijacking and impact being one hour and 17 minutes. Since the hijackers turned off the transponders on the planes, finding them on radar would be the equivalent of finding 3 needles within a 4,500 needle haystack. Also, hijackings had never been used as a method of suicide attack, so there was no protocol to intercept planes over US airspace even if they did find them in time. All in all, pulling off the attacks required very little skill on the part of the hijackers, because the US had no advantages, only disadvantages. Anticipating and stopping the attacks would have required nothing less than omnipotence.","duration":"","id":33,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_cqwlvnz","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":28,"links":[27],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"heelspider","label":"\u0026amp;#8710; Thanks, that was a really good post and did at least change my views on some of the stuff; particularly the war game link.

If these war games weren\u0027t responsible for our inability to track hijacked planes and our lack of available fighters to scramble - as I was led to believe - then it makes our inability to do these things even more inexcusable.)\n\nThat was an interesting comparison to the housing collapse.  Like 9/11, those responsible for causing/preventing it gained tremendously while everyone else lost out.  Maybe that\u0027s the problem with the whole debate...does it really matter if tragedies were intentional or merely a felix culpa?  Or to put it another way, if failing to do one\u0027s job properly leads to great gains, doesn\u0027t that incentivize performance failure whether or not it was consciously intentional?  Shouldn\u0027t our outrage, criticism, and concerns be equal either way?  Should self-benefiting incompetence be accepted as a reasonable excuse, and as far as that goes, is self-benefiting incompetence even a legitimate concept?\n\nI am totally on board with the idea that the government by its very nature classifies way too much.  But I think it\u0027s fair to be skeptical of a story when the source of that story withholds valuable information, has a long history of dishonesty, and has at least in some cases lied about the exact events in question.\n\nSo yeah, thanks you\u0027ve definitely lessened my suspicions but have not quelled them entirely.

Not because I found it insulting, but because it was a fundamental misunderstanding of my position.  I\u0027m not saying a conspiracy necessarily existed, and I\u0027m certainly not advocating any particular narrative of events.  I\u0027m the opposite of what you are saying - - I oppose the presumed conclusion (that the government story is 100% true) and I reject how any flimsy evidence is regarded as proof.  (For instance, does any reasonable person really believe the story they found a hijacker\u0027s passport in tact in the 9/11 ruins?  That can\u0027t possibly be legit.)  My position is simply that this is one of the most important events in modern history and has never been properly investigated.  Never.  Given those circumstances, it seems foolish to go around believing any version of events with reasonable certainty.\n\n\u0026gt;  by imagining perpetrators so diabolically cunning they would make a James Bond villain blush,\n\nThis is where anti-conspiracy people hold a double standard.  There\u0027s no explanation for the events of 9/11 that doesn\u0027t involve diabolical cunning.  You can\u0027t say a flaw in one theory is that involves diabolic cunning when the theory you support also involves diabolical cunning.\n\nAnyhow, again, thanks for the thoughtful response and it did make me rethink a number of things.","duration":"","id":28,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cqwcxng","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":27,"links":[18],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"I\u0027ll try briefly responding to each of your points. I feel like the only way you can really be convinced is to review some of the sites I linked as they are pretty thorough and well-researched.\n\n1. As you say, it is more plausible to assume negligence over malevolence. 9/11 was, from the governments perspective, a catastrophic fuck up on their part. I have no doubt that on 9/11 when it became clear that this was not some terrible accident but in fact a terrorist attack, politicians of all levels went into complete CYA (cover your ass) mode. Just look at the Benghazi incident - orders of magnitude less impactful than 9/11, but all the same CYA behavior in full display. The 9/11 Commission was undoubtedly seen as a threat to those in power, and highly politicized as a result. Sadly, this tends to be the rule rather than the exception.\n\n2. You could say the same thing about the housing collapse. After the fact it seemed obviously preventable. Credit default swaps in hindsight seem as if they were designed by a mad man, yet before the event they were heralded as an amazing innovation in risk management. History is filled with these \u0027black swan\u0027 moments, and it\u0027s no surprise they are a hotbed of conspiracy theories. They seemingly come from nowhere and have an enormous effect. It would be strange if there *weren\u0027t* anomalies or suspicious qualities to them. If they weren\u0027t anomalous they wouldn\u0027t be a black swan event. In the end the cause is always the same: hubris and ignorance in equal parts.\n\n3. The war games were an interesting anomaly, at least on the surface. This is far too large a topic for me to go over in this post, but for an excellent dissection of it, check out this [link](http://www.911myths.com/index.php/War_Games). In short, the claims initially made for war games that seemed to eerily mimic 9/11 on 9/11 either weren\u0027t what people said they were, or did not actually occur on 9/11. They did conduct a war game involving a hijacked airliner, but it was nothing like what occurred on 9/11, so very little confusion actually existed. As you might imagine, the military is quite aware of the concern that an actual attack could coincide with a simulated attack, so they very likely have procedures for dealing with such a scenario. Lastly - and this is me completely hypothesizing - but war games tend to be highly publicized before occurring, presumably to alert other countries to avoid confusion. It\u0027s not out of the question to assume that hijackers shrewdly chose that date in order to help further the chances of success. A far more simple explanation than the government being involved in the attacks.\n\n4. Without looking them up, I can say that the \u0027unaccountable billions of dollars\u0027 claim was disproven. As for the others, they sound like hearsay - not concrete claims or evidence, simply \u0027weird\u0027 stuff. I remember reading about Sibel Edmond\u0027s story, but as I recall, it was more her whistleblowing government incompetence and negligence rather than ever suggesting the attacks were a government plot. \n\n5. You\u0027re going to need produce some sources on this. Doing some looking around, the visa situation seemed fairly typical - mostly tourist or student visas. There appears to be no controversy here, except for some visas being approved when they should been denied. Again, a case where negligence, incompetence, and simply being understaffed for the job, provides a more plausible explanation than collusion in the plot.\n\n6. WTC7 was really only incidental to the attacks. It was damaged by falling debris and uncontrolled fires, then collapsed. To make it anything more than an anomaly, you would have to make a case for why it needed to be demolished in the first place, and how that would have occurred.\n\n7. The government loves classifying things. They will classify entirely innocuous things and have been criticized repeatedly for that. Again, a case of CYA: if it looks like it should be classified, you have more incentive to do it than to not do it. As Snowden showed, however, it only takes one rebellious systems administrator to blow the thing wide open. It\u0027s hard to imagine someone not leaking some damning classified evidence at some point.\n\n8. The President allowed terrorist attacks to happen so could get reelected? That seems a rather risky campaign move. In hindsight you can say he benefited from it, but before the fact I doubt you could make a good case that being caught off guard during the worst attack on the US in history, while reading *My Pet Goat*, would be a solid path for reelection. Yes of course, corporations or arms of the government involved in defense will get a boost during wartime, but that logic gets you nowhere. It means that every war or precusor to war could be a conspiracy concocted by one or more of these groups. The reality is, the government is filled with people with competing interests, and to allow a terrorist attack of this magnitude to occur would require cooperation and collusion of many branches of the government, which brings you back to the problem of everyone keeping their mouths shut. It\u0027s just not very plausible. Moreover, *they don\u0027t need to*  - there is always enough conflict occurring around the globe to justify intelligence and defense spending.\n\nAs for the people affected by the collapse of the towers, just see this [link](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/twintowers/). Notice all the financial companies. If you buy the conspiracy line, surely some of these well-moneyed \u0027illuminati\u0027 types were privy to the plot. You\u0027d think they would have some objections to a plot that would kill their employees and destroy their offices. What about airline companies? What about hedge fund and mutual fund managers who watched the stock market plummet? Why wasn\u0027t their *more* anomalous trading? Isn\u0027t that evidence against it? No, it\u0027s neither evidence for or against anything - at best it\u0027s a reason to open inquiries, but not a sufficient basis to sustain them.\n\nIt would be trivial for me to open any newspaper, look at the crimes that occurred that preceding day, and find people who benefited from them. Should every person who gets an insurance payout when their spouse dies be investigated? That\u0027s about as clear a connection between a tragedy and beneficiary as one can find. And it requires no collusion, so no concerns about loose lips. Of course, the vast majority of these deaths involve no foul play. What about the recent plane crash in Germany? Surely it was actually sabotage by a competing airline. The flight recorder data must have been falsified, as well as his psychiatric data, which of course means his psychiatrist was payed off. \n\nThis is the basic flaw with conspiracy theories: they presuppose a conclusion, and then find all evidence, no matter how flimsy, to prove them. If the evidence doesn\u0027t exist, then you merely need make your theory unfalsifiable, by imagining perpetrators so diabolically cunning they would make a James Bond villain blush, yet simultaneously and paradoxically, leave enough pieces of evidence around that any internet detective could crack the case.\n\nSorry if I came off insulting in that last paragraph, but at a certain point one loses the ability to be reasonable about these things. I realize I didn\u0027t get to everything you mentioned, but in the end the only thing that can change your view is yourself, and it takes work.

So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5280537352605774,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5623804407171877,"sentiment":"  Very positive"},"timestamp":1.430626987E9,"simScore":0.6013658160561401,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430629374E9,"simScore":0.5556711261232484,"sentiment":"  Positive"},"timestamp":1.430649475E9,"simScore":0.6373709400340275,"sentiment":"  Positive"},{"index":35,"links":[34],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"life_is_like_a_sewer","label":"The pilots received adequate training, according to [Time.] (http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,176917-2,00.html) Also, you forget that airport and border security in the US was extremely lax pre-9/11, which was what allowed the hijackers to get US visas and get into the country.

The second plane was only discovered by the FAA as hijacked 8 minutes before it impacted, by which time fighters had been scrambled, but were still 75 miles from Manhattan. The third plane had a very small distance to cover, having left from Dulles International.

The three successful hijacked planes all struck within an hour of one another, with the longest period between hijacking and impact being one hour and 17 minutes. Since the hijackers turned off the transponders on the planes, finding them on radar would be the equivalent of finding 3 needles within a 4,500 needle haystack. Also, hijackings had never been used as a method of suicide attack, so there was no protocol to intercept planes over US airspace even if they did find them in time.

If these war games weren\u0027t responsible for our inability to track hijacked planes and our lack of available fighters to scramble - as I was led to believe - then it makes our inability to do these things even more inexcusable.)\n\nThat was an interesting comparison to the housing collapse.  Like 9/11, those responsible for causing/preventing it gained tremendously while everyone else lost out.  Maybe that\u0027s the problem with the whole debate...does it really matter if tragedies were intentional or merely a felix culpa?  Or to put it another way, if failing to do one\u0027s job properly leads to great gains, doesn\u0027t that incentivize performance failure whether or not it was consciously intentional?  Shouldn\u0027t our outrage, criticism, and concerns be equal either way?  Should self-benefiting incompetence be accepted as a reasonable excuse, and as far as that goes, is self-benefiting incompetence even a legitimate concept?\n\nI am totally on board with the idea that the government by its very nature classifies way too much.

Not because I found it insulting, but because it was a fundamental misunderstanding of my position.  I\u0027m not saying a conspiracy necessarily existed, and I\u0027m certainly not advocating any particular narrative of events.  I\u0027m the opposite of what you are saying - - I oppose the presumed conclusion (that the government story is 100% true) and I reject how any flimsy evidence is regarded as proof.  (For instance, does any reasonable person really believe the story they found a hijacker\u0027s passport in tact in the 9/11 ruins?  That can\u0027t possibly be legit.)  My position is simply that this is one of the most important events in modern history and has never been properly investigated.  Never.  Given those circumstances, it seems foolish to go around believing any version of events with reasonable certainty.\n\n\u0026gt;  by imagining perpetrators so diabolically cunning they would make a James Bond villain blush,\n\nThis is where anti-conspiracy people hold a double standard.  There\u0027s no explanation for the events of 9/11 that doesn\u0027t involve diabolical cunning.  You can\u0027t say a flaw in one theory is that involves diabolic cunning when the theory you support also involves diabolical cunning.\n\nAnyhow, again, thanks for the thoughtful response and it did make me rethink a number of things.","duration":"","id":28,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cqwcxng","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":27,"links":[18],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"I\u0027ll try briefly responding to each of your points. I feel like the only way you can really be convinced is to review some of the sites I linked as they are pretty thorough and well-researched.\n\n1. As you say, it is more plausible to assume negligence over malevolence. 9/11 was, from the governments perspective, a catastrophic fuck up on their part. I have no doubt that on 9/11 when it became clear that this was not some terrible accident but in fact a terrorist attack, politicians of all levels went into complete CYA (cover your ass) mode. Just look at the Benghazi incident - orders of magnitude less impactful than 9/11, but all the same CYA behavior in full display. The 9/11 Commission was undoubtedly seen as a threat to those in power, and highly politicized as a result. Sadly, this tends to be the rule rather than the exception.\n\n2. You could say the same thing about the housing collapse. After the fact it seemed obviously preventable. Credit default swaps in hindsight seem as if they were designed by a mad man, yet before the event they were heralded as an amazing innovation in risk management. History is filled with these \u0027black swan\u0027 moments, and it\u0027s no surprise they are a hotbed of conspiracy theories. They seemingly come from nowhere and have an enormous effect. It would be strange if there *weren\u0027t* anomalies or suspicious qualities to them. If they weren\u0027t anomalous they wouldn\u0027t be a black swan event. In the end the cause is always the same: hubris and ignorance in equal parts.\n\n3. The war games were an interesting anomaly, at least on the surface. This is far too large a topic for me to go over in this post, but for an excellent dissection of it, check out this [link](http://www.911myths.com/index.php/War_Games). In short, the claims initially made for war games that seemed to eerily mimic 9/11 on 9/11 either weren\u0027t what people said they were, or did not actually occur on 9/11. They did conduct a war game involving a hijacked airliner, but it was nothing like what occurred on 9/11, so very little confusion actually existed. As you might imagine, the military is quite aware of the concern that an actual attack could coincide with a simulated attack, so they very likely have procedures for dealing with such a scenario. Lastly - and this is me completely hypothesizing - but war games tend to be highly publicized before occurring, presumably to alert other countries to avoid confusion. It\u0027s not out of the question to assume that hijackers shrewdly chose that date in order to help further the chances of success. A far more simple explanation than the government being involved in the attacks.\n\n4. Without looking them up, I can say that the \u0027unaccountable billions of dollars\u0027 claim was disproven. As for the others, they sound like hearsay - not concrete claims or evidence, simply \u0027weird\u0027 stuff. I remember reading about Sibel Edmond\u0027s story, but as I recall, it was more her whistleblowing government incompetence and negligence rather than ever suggesting the attacks were a government plot. \n\n5. You\u0027re going to need produce some sources on this. Doing some looking around, the visa situation seemed fairly typical - mostly tourist or student visas. There appears to be no controversy here, except for some visas being approved when they should been denied. Again, a case where negligence, incompetence, and simply being understaffed for the job, provides a more plausible explanation than collusion in the plot.\n\n6. WTC7 was really only incidental to the attacks. It was damaged by falling debris and uncontrolled fires, then collapsed. To make it anything more than an anomaly, you would have to make a case for why it needed to be demolished in the first place, and how that would have occurred.\n\n7. The government loves classifying things. They will classify entirely innocuous things and have been criticized repeatedly for that. Again, a case of CYA: if it looks like it should be classified, you have more incentive to do it than to not do it. As Snowden showed, however, it only takes one rebellious systems administrator to blow the thing wide open. It\u0027s hard to imagine someone not leaking some damning classified evidence at some point.\n\n8. The President allowed terrorist attacks to happen so could get reelected? That seems a rather risky campaign move. In hindsight you can say he benefited from it, but before the fact I doubt you could make a good case that being caught off guard during the worst attack on the US in history, while reading *My Pet Goat*, would be a solid path for reelection. Yes of course, corporations or arms of the government involved in defense will get a boost during wartime, but that logic gets you nowhere. It means that every war or precusor to war could be a conspiracy concocted by one or more of these groups. The reality is, the government is filled with people with competing interests, and to allow a terrorist attack of this magnitude to occur would require cooperation and collusion of many branches of the government, which brings you back to the problem of everyone keeping their mouths shut. It\u0027s just not very plausible. Moreover, *they don\u0027t need to*  - there is always enough conflict occurring around the globe to justify intelligence and defense spending.\n\nAs for the people affected by the collapse of the towers, just see this [link](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/twintowers/). Notice all the financial companies. If you buy the conspiracy line, surely some of these well-moneyed \u0027illuminati\u0027 types were privy to the plot. You\u0027d think they would have some objections to a plot that would kill their employees and destroy their offices. What about airline companies? What about hedge fund and mutual fund managers who watched the stock market plummet? Why wasn\u0027t their *more* anomalous trading? Isn\u0027t that evidence against it? No, it\u0027s neither evidence for or against anything - at best it\u0027s a reason to open inquiries, but not a sufficient basis to sustain them.\n\nIt would be trivial for me to open any newspaper, look at the crimes that occurred that preceding day, and find people who benefited from them. Should every person who gets an insurance payout when their spouse dies be investigated? That\u0027s about as clear a connection between a tragedy and beneficiary as one can find. And it requires no collusion, so no concerns about loose lips. Of course, the vast majority of these deaths involve no foul play. What about the recent plane crash in Germany? Surely it was actually sabotage by a competing airline. The flight recorder data must have been falsified, as well as his psychiatric data, which of course means his psychiatrist was payed off. \n\nThis is the basic flaw with conspiracy theories: they presuppose a conclusion, and then find all evidence, no matter how flimsy, to prove them. If the evidence doesn\u0027t exist, then you merely need make your theory unfalsifiable, by imagining perpetrators so diabolically cunning they would make a James Bond villain blush, yet simultaneously and paradoxically, leave enough pieces of evidence around that any internet detective could crack the case.\n\nSorry if I came off insulting in that last paragraph, but at a certain point one loses the ability to be reasonable about these things.

Like I already agree with you on most of your points...I too don\u0027t give much credence to stuff like analyzing the Pentagon debris or alleged experts talking about building structures.\n\n1)  Key members of the Commission say they were lied to and that the whole project was underfunded.  While this in no way proves a conspiracy, it does pretty much prove we don\u0027t know the whole story.  I admit the most likely explanation is the Bush Admin. was trying to cover up their mistakes and incompetence, but either way what we all consider the \"official story\" almost certainly is incomplete (at best).  Plus, the commission report has a huge section redacted.\n\n2)  I don\u0027t understand how the most powerful military in the history of everything allowed a direct strike on its headquarters without raising a single defense.\n\n3)  The attacks would not have been possible without the war games going on regarding multiple hijackings.  That a never-seen-before type of attack happened at the exact same time we were drilling for that never-seen-before type of attack is very hard to swallow as a coincidence.\n\n4)  I too am very skeptical of random internet claims, so maybe these are complete fabrications, but I haven\u0027t seen them completely debunked.  I\u0027m talking specifically that the Administration quit flying commercially a month before 9/11, that they took the anti-Anthrax pill right before 9/11, that Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon lost billions of dollars of unaccounted money right before 9/11, that several of the hijackers lived right down the street from NSA headquarters, that many other countries warned us about it beforehand, other high-jackers appeared to live lives completely in contrast to that of a devout Muslim, that a bunch of people with Mossad ties were caught filming and celebrating the attacks, Sibel Edmonds\u0027 claims, etc. etc.\n\nWhile obviously I don\u0027t expect anyone to go through every single point, I do wonder if there is a good clear reason to not be concerned with stuff like this at all.\n\n5)  I think we do know with reasonable certainty that the FBI stopped local agents from investigating future hijackers.  We also have pretty reliable testimony that rejected visas for these hijackers were reversed from higher ups.  We also know that the PATRIOT Act appeared fully written at mind-blowing speed.  Should either of these facts cause me to be suspicious?\n\n6)  WTC7 is not mentioned a single time in the entire commission report.  Maybe this was just a big-time fuck up of epic proportions, who knows?  Seems like there are a thousand things about that day that are simply written off as big-time fuck ups of epic proportions.  How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.  It\u0027s getting hard to see how this many years later, revealing this information would still put active spies at risk or otherwise legitimately threaten the safety of Americans generally.  For instance, why can\u0027t they release any of the camera angles of the Pentagon attack that would have showed what happened, as opposed to just giving us one video with a blur on it?\n\n8)  Finally, I\u0027ll say the one place I disagreed with you was how you glossed over the \u0027who benefits\u0027 argument.  The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.

Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk.

They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact.

The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views.

Not to mention the fact that there was never a domestic air interception policy pre-9/11, that defense efforts had to be coordinated from NORAD, which doesn\u0027t have transponder data, and that by the time the first flight was even reported as hijacked, the FAA and NORAD had only 20 minutes to find the plane, create a plan to intercept the plane, intercept the plane, and then, based off of nothing (no reason to suspect a suicide attack), decide to shoot down a civilian airliner. The second plane was only discovered by the FAA as hijacked 8 minutes before it impacted, by which time fighters had been scrambled, but were still 75 miles from Manhattan. The third plane had a very small distance to cover, having left from Dulles International. The FAA shared suspicion that it was hijacked with NORAD at 9:34, and told them to scramble fighters at 9:35, but the plane hit the Pentagon at 9:37.

The three successful hijacked planes all struck within an hour of one another, with the longest period between hijacking and impact being one hour and 17 minutes. Since the hijackers turned off the transponders on the planes, finding them on radar would be the equivalent of finding 3 needles within a 4,500 needle haystack. Also, hijackings had never been used as a method of suicide attack, so there was no protocol to intercept planes over US airspace even if they did find them in time.

If these war games weren\u0027t responsible for our inability to track hijacked planes and our lack of available fighters to scramble - as I was led to believe - then it makes our inability to do these things even more inexcusable.)\n\nThat was an interesting comparison to the housing collapse.  Like 9/11, those responsible for causing/preventing it gained tremendously while everyone else lost out.  Maybe that\u0027s the problem with the whole debate...does it really matter if tragedies were intentional or merely a felix culpa?

Not because I found it insulting, but because it was a fundamental misunderstanding of my position.  I\u0027m not saying a conspiracy necessarily existed, and I\u0027m certainly not advocating any particular narrative of events.  I\u0027m the opposite of what you are saying - - I oppose the presumed conclusion (that the government story is 100% true) and I reject how any flimsy evidence is regarded as proof.  (For instance, does any reasonable person really believe the story they found a hijacker\u0027s passport in tact in the 9/11 ruins?  That can\u0027t possibly be legit.)  My position is simply that this is one of the most important events in modern history and has never been properly investigated.  Never.  Given those circumstances, it seems foolish to go around believing any version of events with reasonable certainty.\n\n\u0026gt;  by imagining perpetrators so diabolically cunning they would make a James Bond villain blush,\n\nThis is where anti-conspiracy people hold a double standard.  There\u0027s no explanation for the events of 9/11 that doesn\u0027t involve diabolical cunning.  You can\u0027t say a flaw in one theory is that involves diabolic cunning when the theory you support also involves diabolical cunning.\n\nAnyhow, again, thanks for the thoughtful response and it did make me rethink a number of things.","duration":"","id":28,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cqwcxng","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":27,"links":[18],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"I\u0027ll try briefly responding to each of your points. I feel like the only way you can really be convinced is to review some of the sites I linked as they are pretty thorough and well-researched.\n\n1. As you say, it is more plausible to assume negligence over malevolence. 9/11 was, from the governments perspective, a catastrophic fuck up on their part. I have no doubt that on 9/11 when it became clear that this was not some terrible accident but in fact a terrorist attack, politicians of all levels went into complete CYA (cover your ass) mode. Just look at the Benghazi incident - orders of magnitude less impactful than 9/11, but all the same CYA behavior in full display. The 9/11 Commission was undoubtedly seen as a threat to those in power, and highly politicized as a result. Sadly, this tends to be the rule rather than the exception.\n\n2. You could say the same thing about the housing collapse. After the fact it seemed obviously preventable. Credit default swaps in hindsight seem as if they were designed by a mad man, yet before the event they were heralded as an amazing innovation in risk management. History is filled with these \u0027black swan\u0027 moments, and it\u0027s no surprise they are a hotbed of conspiracy theories. They seemingly come from nowhere and have an enormous effect. It would be strange if there *weren\u0027t* anomalies or suspicious qualities to them. If they weren\u0027t anomalous they wouldn\u0027t be a black swan event. In the end the cause is always the same: hubris and ignorance in equal parts.\n\n3. The war games were an interesting anomaly, at least on the surface. This is far too large a topic for me to go over in this post, but for an excellent dissection of it, check out this [link](http://www.911myths.com/index.php/War_Games). In short, the claims initially made for war games that seemed to eerily mimic 9/11 on 9/11 either weren\u0027t what people said they were, or did not actually occur on 9/11. They did conduct a war game involving a hijacked airliner, but it was nothing like what occurred on 9/11, so very little confusion actually existed. As you might imagine, the military is quite aware of the concern that an actual attack could coincide with a simulated attack, so they very likely have procedures for dealing with such a scenario. Lastly - and this is me completely hypothesizing - but war games tend to be highly publicized before occurring, presumably to alert other countries to avoid confusion. It\u0027s not out of the question to assume that hijackers shrewdly chose that date in order to help further the chances of success. A far more simple explanation than the government being involved in the attacks.\n\n4. Without looking them up, I can say that the \u0027unaccountable billions of dollars\u0027 claim was disproven. As for the others, they sound like hearsay - not concrete claims or evidence, simply \u0027weird\u0027 stuff. I remember reading about Sibel Edmond\u0027s story, but as I recall, it was more her whistleblowing government incompetence and negligence rather than ever suggesting the attacks were a government plot. \n\n5. You\u0027re going to need produce some sources on this. Doing some looking around, the visa situation seemed fairly typical - mostly tourist or student visas. There appears to be no controversy here, except for some visas being approved when they should been denied. Again, a case where negligence, incompetence, and simply being understaffed for the job, provides a more plausible explanation than collusion in the plot.\n\n6. WTC7 was really only incidental to the attacks. It was damaged by falling debris and uncontrolled fires, then collapsed. To make it anything more than an anomaly, you would have to make a case for why it needed to be demolished in the first place, and how that would have occurred.\n\n7. The government loves classifying things. They will classify entirely innocuous things and have been criticized repeatedly for that. Again, a case of CYA: if it looks like it should be classified, you have more incentive to do it than to not do it. As Snowden showed, however, it only takes one rebellious systems administrator to blow the thing wide open. It\u0027s hard to imagine someone not leaking some damning classified evidence at some point.\n\n8. The President allowed terrorist attacks to happen so could get reelected? That seems a rather risky campaign move. In hindsight you can say he benefited from it, but before the fact I doubt you could make a good case that being caught off guard during the worst attack on the US in history, while reading *My Pet Goat*, would be a solid path for reelection. Yes of course, corporations or arms of the government involved in defense will get a boost during wartime, but that logic gets you nowhere. It means that every war or precusor to war could be a conspiracy concocted by one or more of these groups. The reality is, the government is filled with people with competing interests, and to allow a terrorist attack of this magnitude to occur would require cooperation and collusion of many branches of the government, which brings you back to the problem of everyone keeping their mouths shut. It\u0027s just not very plausible. Moreover, *they don\u0027t need to*  - there is always enough conflict occurring around the globe to justify intelligence and defense spending.\n\nAs for the people affected by the collapse of the towers, just see this [link](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/twintowers/). Notice all the financial companies. If you buy the conspiracy line, surely some of these well-moneyed \u0027illuminati\u0027 types were privy to the plot. You\u0027d think they would have some objections to a plot that would kill their employees and destroy their offices. What about airline companies? What about hedge fund and mutual fund managers who watched the stock market plummet? Why wasn\u0027t their *more* anomalous trading? Isn\u0027t that evidence against it? No, it\u0027s neither evidence for or against anything - at best it\u0027s a reason to open inquiries, but not a sufficient basis to sustain them.\n\nIt would be trivial for me to open any newspaper, look at the crimes that occurred that preceding day, and find people who benefited from them. Should every person who gets an insurance payout when their spouse dies be investigated? That\u0027s about as clear a connection between a tragedy and beneficiary as one can find. And it requires no collusion, so no concerns about loose lips. Of course, the vast majority of these deaths involve no foul play. What about the recent plane crash in Germany? Surely it was actually sabotage by a competing airline. The flight recorder data must have been falsified, as well as his psychiatric data, which of course means his psychiatrist was payed off. \n\nThis is the basic flaw with conspiracy theories: they presuppose a conclusion, and then find all evidence, no matter how flimsy, to prove them. If the evidence doesn\u0027t exist, then you merely need make your theory unfalsifiable, by imagining perpetrators so diabolically cunning they would make a James Bond villain blush, yet simultaneously and paradoxically, leave enough pieces of evidence around that any internet detective could crack the case.\n\nSorry if I came off insulting in that last paragraph, but at a certain point one loses the ability to be reasonable about these things. I realize I didn\u0027t get to everything you mentioned, but in the end the only thing that can change your view is yourself, and it takes work.

Like I already agree with you on most of your points...I too don\u0027t give much credence to stuff like analyzing the Pentagon debris or alleged experts talking about building structures.\n\n1)  Key members of the Commission say they were lied to and that the whole project was underfunded.  While this in no way proves a conspiracy, it does pretty much prove we don\u0027t know the whole story.  I admit the most likely explanation is the Bush Admin. was trying to cover up their mistakes and incompetence, but either way what we all consider the \"official story\" almost certainly is incomplete (at best).  Plus, the commission report has a huge section redacted.\n\n2)  I don\u0027t understand how the most powerful military in the history of everything allowed a direct strike on its headquarters without raising a single defense.\n\n3)  The attacks would not have been possible without the war games going on regarding multiple hijackings.  That a never-seen-before type of attack happened at the exact same time we were drilling for that never-seen-before type of attack is very hard to swallow as a coincidence.\n\n4)  I too am very skeptical of random internet claims, so maybe these are complete fabrications, but I haven\u0027t seen them completely debunked.  I\u0027m talking specifically that the Administration quit flying commercially a month before 9/11, that they took the anti-Anthrax pill right before 9/11, that Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon lost billions of dollars of unaccounted money right before 9/11, that several of the hijackers lived right down the street from NSA headquarters, that many other countries warned us about it beforehand, other high-jackers appeared to live lives completely in contrast to that of a devout Muslim, that a bunch of people with Mossad ties were caught filming and celebrating the attacks, Sibel Edmonds\u0027 claims, etc. etc.\n\nWhile obviously I don\u0027t expect anyone to go through every single point, I do wonder if there is a good clear reason to not be concerned with stuff like this at all.\n\n5)  I think we do know with reasonable certainty that the FBI stopped local agents from investigating future hijackers.  We also have pretty reliable testimony that rejected visas for these hijackers were reversed from higher ups.  We also know that the PATRIOT Act appeared fully written at mind-blowing speed.  Should either of these facts cause me to be suspicious?\n\n6)  WTC7 is not mentioned a single time in the entire commission report.  Maybe this was just a big-time fuck up of epic proportions, who knows?  Seems like there are a thousand things about that day that are simply written off as big-time fuck ups of epic proportions.  How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.  It\u0027s getting hard to see how this many years later, revealing this information would still put active spies at risk or otherwise legitimately threaten the safety of Americans generally.  For instance, why can\u0027t they release any of the camera angles of the Pentagon attack that would have showed what happened, as opposed to just giving us one video with a blur on it?\n\n8)  Finally, I\u0027ll say the one place I disagreed with you was how you glossed over the \u0027who benefits\u0027 argument.  The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented.

I feel like the only way you can really be convinced is to review some of the sites I linked as they are pretty thorough and well-researched.\n\n1. As you say, it is more plausible to assume negligence over malevolence. 9/11 was, from the governments perspective, a catastrophic fuck up on their part. I have no doubt that on 9/11 when it became clear that this was not some terrible accident but in fact a terrorist attack, politicians of all levels went into complete CYA (cover your ass) mode. Just look at the Benghazi incident - orders of magnitude less impactful than 9/11, but all the same CYA behavior in full display. The 9/11 Commission was undoubtedly seen as a threat to those in power, and highly politicized as a result. Sadly, this tends to be the rule rather than the exception.\n\n2. You could say the same thing about the housing collapse. After the fact it seemed obviously preventable. Credit default swaps in hindsight seem as if they were designed by a mad man, yet before the event they were heralded as an amazing innovation in risk management. History is filled with these \u0027black swan\u0027 moments, and it\u0027s no surprise they are a hotbed of conspiracy theories. They seemingly come from nowhere and have an enormous effect. It would be strange if there *weren\u0027t* anomalies or suspicious qualities to them. If they weren\u0027t anomalous they wouldn\u0027t be a black swan event. In the end the cause is always the same: hubris and ignorance in equal parts.\n\n3. The war games were an interesting anomaly, at least on the surface. This is far too large a topic for me to go over in this post, but for an excellent dissection of it, check out this [link](http://www.911myths.com/index.php/War_Games). In short, the claims initially made for war games that seemed to eerily mimic 9/11 on 9/11 either weren\u0027t what people said they were, or did not actually occur on 9/11. They did conduct a war game involving a hijacked airliner, but it was nothing like what occurred on 9/11, so very little confusion actually existed. As you might imagine, the military is quite aware of the concern that an actual attack could coincide with a simulated attack, so they very likely have procedures for dealing with such a scenario. Lastly - and this is me completely hypothesizing - but war games tend to be highly publicized before occurring, presumably to alert other countries to avoid confusion. It\u0027s not out of the question to assume that hijackers shrewdly chose that date in order to help further the chances of success. A far more simple explanation than the government being involved in the attacks.\n\n4. Without looking them up, I can say that the \u0027unaccountable billions of dollars\u0027 claim was disproven. As for the others, they sound like hearsay - not concrete claims or evidence, simply \u0027weird\u0027 stuff. I remember reading about Sibel Edmond\u0027s story, but as I recall, it was more her whistleblowing government incompetence and negligence rather than ever suggesting the attacks were a government plot. \n\n5. You\u0027re going to need produce some sources on this. Doing some looking around, the visa situation seemed fairly typical - mostly tourist or student visas. There appears to be no controversy here, except for some visas being approved when they should been denied. Again, a case where negligence, incompetence, and simply being understaffed for the job, provides a more plausible explanation than collusion in the plot.\n\n6. WTC7 was really only incidental to the attacks. It was damaged by falling debris and uncontrolled fires, then collapsed. To make it anything more than an anomaly, you would have to make a case for why it needed to be demolished in the first place, and how that would have occurred.\n\n7. The government loves classifying things. They will classify entirely innocuous things and have been criticized repeatedly for that. Again, a case of CYA: if it looks like it should be classified, you have more incentive to do it than to not do it. As Snowden showed, however, it only takes one rebellious systems administrator to blow the thing wide open. It\u0027s hard to imagine someone not leaking some damning classified evidence at some point.\n\n8. The President allowed terrorist attacks to happen so could get reelected? That seems a rather risky campaign move. In hindsight you can say he benefited from it, but before the fact I doubt you could make a good case that being caught off guard during the worst attack on the US in history, while reading *My Pet Goat*, would be a solid path for reelection. Yes of course, corporations or arms of the government involved in defense will get a boost during wartime, but that logic gets you nowhere. It means that every war or precusor to war could be a conspiracy concocted by one or more of these groups. The reality is, the government is filled with people with competing interests, and to allow a terrorist attack of this magnitude to occur would require cooperation and collusion of many branches of the government, which brings you back to the problem of everyone keeping their mouths shut. It\u0027s just not very plausible. Moreover, *they don\u0027t need to*  - there is always enough conflict occurring around the globe to justify intelligence and defense spending.\n\nAs for the people affected by the collapse of the towers, just see this [link](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/twintowers/). Notice all the financial companies. If you buy the conspiracy line, surely some of these well-moneyed \u0027illuminati\u0027 types were privy to the plot. You\u0027d think they would have some objections to a plot that would kill their employees and destroy their offices. What about airline companies? What about hedge fund and mutual fund managers who watched the stock market plummet? Why wasn\u0027t their *more* anomalous trading? Isn\u0027t that evidence against it? No, it\u0027s neither evidence for or against anything - at best it\u0027s a reason to open inquiries, but not a sufficient basis to sustain them.\n\nIt would be trivial for me to open any newspaper, look at the crimes that occurred that preceding day, and find people who benefited from them. Should every person who gets an insurance payout when their spouse dies be investigated? That\u0027s about as clear a connection between a tragedy and beneficiary as one can find. And it requires no collusion, so no concerns about loose lips. Of course, the vast majority of these deaths involve no foul play. What about the recent plane crash in Germany? Surely it was actually sabotage by a competing airline. The flight recorder data must have been falsified, as well as his psychiatric data, which of course means his psychiatrist was payed off. \n\nThis is the basic flaw with conspiracy theories: they presuppose a conclusion, and then find all evidence, no matter how flimsy, to prove them. If the evidence doesn\u0027t exist, then you merely need make your theory unfalsifiable, by imagining perpetrators so diabolically cunning they would make a James Bond villain blush, yet simultaneously and paradoxically, leave enough pieces of evidence around that any internet detective could crack the case.\n\nSorry if I came off insulting in that last paragraph, but at a certain point one loses the ability to be reasonable about these things. I realize I didn\u0027t get to everything you mentioned, but in the end the only thing that can change your view is yourself, and it takes work.

As someone who lost your skepticism of 9/11, and very capable of clear, convincing, and thoughtful writing, maybe you could help me lose my skepticism too.  Like I already agree with you on most of your points...I too don\u0027t give much credence to stuff like analyzing the Pentagon debris or alleged experts talking about building structures.\n\n1)  Key members of the Commission say they were lied to and that the whole project was underfunded.  While this in no way proves a conspiracy, it does pretty much prove we don\u0027t know the whole story.  I admit the most likely explanation is the Bush Admin. was trying to cover up their mistakes and incompetence, but either way what we all consider the \"official story\" almost certainly is incomplete (at best).  Plus, the commission report has a huge section redacted.\n\n2)  I don\u0027t understand how the most powerful military in the history of everything allowed a direct strike on its headquarters without raising a single defense.\n\n3)  The attacks would not have been possible without the war games going on regarding multiple hijackings.  That a never-seen-before type of attack happened at the exact same time we were drilling for that never-seen-before type of attack is very hard to swallow as a coincidence.\n\n4)  I too am very skeptical of random internet claims, so maybe these are complete fabrications, but I haven\u0027t seen them completely debunked.  I\u0027m talking specifically that the Administration quit flying commercially a month before 9/11, that they took the anti-Anthrax pill right before 9/11, that Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon lost billions of dollars of unaccounted money right before 9/11, that several of the hijackers lived right down the street from NSA headquarters, that many other countries warned us about it beforehand, other high-jackers appeared to live lives completely in contrast to that of a devout Muslim, that a bunch of people with Mossad ties were caught filming and celebrating the attacks, Sibel Edmonds\u0027 claims, etc. etc.\n\nWhile obviously I don\u0027t expect anyone to go through every single point, I do wonder if there is a good clear reason to not be concerned with stuff like this at all.\n\n5)  I think we do know with reasonable certainty that the FBI stopped local agents from investigating future hijackers.  We also have pretty reliable testimony that rejected visas for these hijackers were reversed from higher ups.  We also know that the PATRIOT Act appeared fully written at mind-blowing speed.  Should either of these facts cause me to be suspicious?\n\n6)  WTC7 is not mentioned a single time in the entire commission report.  Maybe this was just a big-time fuck up of epic proportions, who knows?  Seems like there are a thousand things about that day that are simply written off as big-time fuck ups of epic proportions.  How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.  It\u0027s getting hard to see how this many years later, revealing this information would still put active spies at risk or otherwise legitimately threaten the safety of Americans generally.  For instance, why can\u0027t they release any of the camera angles of the Pentagon attack that would have showed what happened, as opposed to just giving us one video with a blur on it?\n\n8)  Finally, I\u0027ll say the one place I disagreed with you was how you glossed over the \u0027who benefits\u0027 argument.  The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view.

You can\u0027t say a flaw in one theory is that involves diabolic cunning when the theory you support also involves diabolical cunning.\n\nAnyhow, again, thanks for the thoughtful response and it did make me rethink a number of things.","duration":"","id":28,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cqwcxng","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":27,"links":[18],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"I\u0027ll try briefly responding to each of your points. I feel like the only way you can really be convinced is to review some of the sites I linked as they are pretty thorough and well-researched.\n\n1. As you say, it is more plausible to assume negligence over malevolence. 9/11 was, from the governments perspective, a catastrophic fuck up on their part. I have no doubt that on 9/11 when it became clear that this was not some terrible accident but in fact a terrorist attack, politicians of all levels went into complete CYA (cover your ass) mode. Just look at the Benghazi incident - orders of magnitude less impactful than 9/11, but all the same CYA behavior in full display. The 9/11 Commission was undoubtedly seen as a threat to those in power, and highly politicized as a result. Sadly, this tends to be the rule rather than the exception.\n\n2. You could say the same thing about the housing collapse. After the fact it seemed obviously preventable. Credit default swaps in hindsight seem as if they were designed by a mad man, yet before the event they were heralded as an amazing innovation in risk management. History is filled with these \u0027black swan\u0027 moments, and it\u0027s no surprise they are a hotbed of conspiracy theories. They seemingly come from nowhere and have an enormous effect. It would be strange if there *weren\u0027t* anomalies or suspicious qualities to them. If they weren\u0027t anomalous they wouldn\u0027t be a black swan event. In the end the cause is always the same: hubris and ignorance in equal parts.\n\n3. The war games were an interesting anomaly, at least on the surface. This is far too large a topic for me to go over in this post, but for an excellent dissection of it, check out this [link](http://www.911myths.com/index.php/War_Games). In short, the claims initially made for war games that seemed to eerily mimic 9/11 on 9/11 either weren\u0027t what people said they were, or did not actually occur on 9/11. They did conduct a war game involving a hijacked airliner, but it was nothing like what occurred on 9/11, so very little confusion actually existed. As you might imagine, the military is quite aware of the concern that an actual attack could coincide with a simulated attack, so they very likely have procedures for dealing with such a scenario. Lastly - and this is me completely hypothesizing - but war games tend to be highly publicized before occurring, presumably to alert other countries to avoid confusion. It\u0027s not out of the question to assume that hijackers shrewdly chose that date in order to help further the chances of success. A far more simple explanation than the government being involved in the attacks.\n\n4. Without looking them up, I can say that the \u0027unaccountable billions of dollars\u0027 claim was disproven. As for the others, they sound like hearsay - not concrete claims or evidence, simply \u0027weird\u0027 stuff. I remember reading about Sibel Edmond\u0027s story, but as I recall, it was more her whistleblowing government incompetence and negligence rather than ever suggesting the attacks were a government plot. \n\n5. You\u0027re going to need produce some sources on this. Doing some looking around, the visa situation seemed fairly typical - mostly tourist or student visas. There appears to be no controversy here, except for some visas being approved when they should been denied. Again, a case where negligence, incompetence, and simply being understaffed for the job, provides a more plausible explanation than collusion in the plot.\n\n6. WTC7 was really only incidental to the attacks. It was damaged by falling debris and uncontrolled fires, then collapsed. To make it anything more than an anomaly, you would have to make a case for why it needed to be demolished in the first place, and how that would have occurred.\n\n7. The government loves classifying things. They will classify entirely innocuous things and have been criticized repeatedly for that. Again, a case of CYA: if it looks like it should be classified, you have more incentive to do it than to not do it. As Snowden showed, however, it only takes one rebellious systems administrator to blow the thing wide open. It\u0027s hard to imagine someone not leaking some damning classified evidence at some point.\n\n8. The President allowed terrorist attacks to happen so could get reelected? That seems a rather risky campaign move. In hindsight you can say he benefited from it, but before the fact I doubt you could make a good case that being caught off guard during the worst attack on the US in history, while reading *My Pet Goat*, would be a solid path for reelection. Yes of course, corporations or arms of the government involved in defense will get a boost during wartime, but that logic gets you nowhere. It means that every war or precusor to war could be a conspiracy concocted by one or more of these groups. The reality is, the government is filled with people with competing interests, and to allow a terrorist attack of this magnitude to occur would require cooperation and collusion of many branches of the government, which brings you back to the problem of everyone keeping their mouths shut. It\u0027s just not very plausible. Moreover, *they don\u0027t need to*  - there is always enough conflict occurring around the globe to justify intelligence and defense spending.\n\nAs for the people affected by the collapse of the towers, just see this [link](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/twintowers/). Notice all the financial companies. If you buy the conspiracy line, surely some of these well-moneyed \u0027illuminati\u0027 types were privy to the plot. You\u0027d think they would have some objections to a plot that would kill their employees and destroy their offices. What about airline companies? What about hedge fund and mutual fund managers who watched the stock market plummet? Why wasn\u0027t their *more* anomalous trading? Isn\u0027t that evidence against it? No, it\u0027s neither evidence for or against anything - at best it\u0027s a reason to open inquiries, but not a sufficient basis to sustain them.\n\nIt would be trivial for me to open any newspaper, look at the crimes that occurred that preceding day, and find people who benefited from them. Should every person who gets an insurance payout when their spouse dies be investigated? That\u0027s about as clear a connection between a tragedy and beneficiary as one can find. And it requires no collusion, so no concerns about loose lips. Of course, the vast majority of these deaths involve no foul play. What about the recent plane crash in Germany? Surely it was actually sabotage by a competing airline. The flight recorder data must have been falsified, as well as his psychiatric data, which of course means his psychiatrist was payed off. \n\nThis is the basic flaw with conspiracy theories: they presuppose a conclusion, and then find all evidence, no matter how flimsy, to prove them. If the evidence doesn\u0027t exist, then you merely need make your theory unfalsifiable, by imagining perpetrators so diabolically cunning they would make a James Bond villain blush, yet simultaneously and paradoxically, leave enough pieces of evidence around that any internet detective could crack the case.\n\nSorry if I came off insulting in that last paragraph, but at a certain point one loses the ability to be reasonable about these things. I realize I didn\u0027t get to everything you mentioned, but in the end the only thing that can change your view is yourself, and it takes work. Please for God\u0027s sake don\u0027t make this time I spent on a lovely Saturday afternoon meaningless by going down a rabbit hole of nano-thermite and missle pods. *You\u0027re better than that.*","duration":"","id":27,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_cqwbt0m","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":18,"links":[1],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"heelspider","label":"I really enjoyed your post.  As someone who lost your skepticism of 9/11, and very capable of clear, convincing, and thoughtful writing, maybe you could help me lose my skepticism too.  Like I already agree with you on most of your points...I too don\u0027t give much credence to stuff like analyzing the Pentagon debris or alleged experts talking about building structures.\n\n1)  Key members of the Commission say they were lied to and that the whole project was underfunded.  While this in no way proves a conspiracy, it does pretty much prove we don\u0027t know the whole story.  I admit the most likely explanation is the Bush Admin. was trying to cover up their mistakes and incompetence, but either way what we all consider the \"official story\" almost certainly is incomplete (at best).  Plus, the commission report has a huge section redacted.\n\n2)  I don\u0027t understand how the most powerful military in the history of everything allowed a direct strike on its headquarters without raising a single defense.\n\n3)  The attacks would not have been possible without the war games going on regarding multiple hijackings.  That a never-seen-before type of attack happened at the exact same time we were drilling for that never-seen-before type of attack is very hard to swallow as a coincidence.\n\n4)  I too am very skeptical of random internet claims, so maybe these are complete fabrications, but I haven\u0027t seen them completely debunked.  I\u0027m talking specifically that the Administration quit flying commercially a month before 9/11, that they took the anti-Anthrax pill right before 9/11, that Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon lost billions of dollars of unaccounted money right before 9/11, that several of the hijackers lived right down the street from NSA headquarters, that many other countries warned us about it beforehand, other high-jackers appeared to live lives completely in contrast to that of a devout Muslim, that a bunch of people with Mossad ties were caught filming and celebrating the attacks, Sibel Edmonds\u0027 claims, etc. etc.\n\nWhile obviously I don\u0027t expect anyone to go through every single point, I do wonder if there is a good clear reason to not be concerned with stuff like this at all.\n\n5)  I think we do know with reasonable certainty that the FBI stopped local agents from investigating future hijackers.  We also have pretty reliable testimony that rejected visas for these hijackers were reversed from higher ups.  We also know that the PATRIOT Act appeared fully written at mind-blowing speed.  Should either of these facts cause me to be suspicious?\n\n6)  WTC7 is not mentioned a single time in the entire commission report.  Maybe this was just a big-time fuck up of epic proportions, who knows?  Seems like there are a thousand things about that day that are simply written off as big-time fuck ups of epic proportions.  How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.  It\u0027s getting hard to see how this many years later, revealing this information would still put active spies at risk or otherwise legitimately threaten the safety of Americans generally.  For instance, why can\u0027t they release any of the camera angles of the Pentagon attack that would have showed what happened, as opposed to just giving us one video with a blur on it?\n\n8)  Finally, I\u0027ll say the one place I disagreed with you was how you glossed over the \u0027who benefits\u0027 argument.  The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5280537352605774,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5623804407171877,"sentiment":"  Very positive"},"timestamp":1.430626987E9,"simScore":0.6013658160561401,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430629374E9,"simScore":0.754776770525476,"sentiment":"  Positive"},"timestamp":1.430632187E9,"simScore":0.6665413770058676,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},{"index":39,"links":[38],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"thrasumachos","label":"Ground Zero is also a pretty common term.

The reality is, the government is filled with people with competing interests, and to allow a terrorist attack of this magnitude to occur would require cooperation and collusion of many branches of the government, which brings you back to the problem of everyone keeping their mouths shut. It\u0027s just not very plausible. Moreover, *they don\u0027t need to*  - there is always enough conflict occurring around the globe to justify intelligence and defense spending.\n\nAs for the people affected by the collapse of the towers, just see this [link](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/twintowers/). Notice all the financial companies. If you buy the conspiracy line, surely some of these well-moneyed \u0027illuminati\u0027 types were privy to the plot. You\u0027d think they would have some objections to a plot that would kill their employees and destroy their offices. What about airline companies? What about hedge fund and mutual fund managers who watched the stock market plummet? Why wasn\u0027t their *more* anomalous trading? Isn\u0027t that evidence against it? No, it\u0027s neither evidence for or against anything - at best it\u0027s a reason to open inquiries, but not a sufficient basis to sustain them.\n\nIt would be trivial for me to open any newspaper, look at the crimes that occurred that preceding day, and find people who benefited from them. Should every person who gets an insurance payout when their spouse dies be investigated? That\u0027s about as clear a connection between a tragedy and beneficiary as one can find. And it requires no collusion, so no concerns about loose lips. Of course, the vast majority of these deaths involve no foul play. What about the recent plane crash in Germany? Surely it was actually sabotage by a competing airline. The flight recorder data must have been falsified, as well as his psychiatric data, which of course means his psychiatrist was payed off. \n\nThis is the basic flaw with conspiracy theories: they presuppose a conclusion, and then find all evidence, no matter how flimsy, to prove them. If the evidence doesn\u0027t exist, then you merely need make your theory unfalsifiable, by imagining perpetrators so diabolically cunning they would make a James Bond villain blush, yet simultaneously and paradoxically, leave enough pieces of evidence around that any internet detective could crack the case.\n\nSorry if I came off insulting in that last paragraph, but at a certain point one loses the ability to be reasonable about these things. I realize I didn\u0027t get to everything you mentioned, but in the end the only thing that can change your view is yourself, and it takes work.

As someone who lost your skepticism of 9/11, and very capable of clear, convincing, and thoughtful writing, maybe you could help me lose my skepticism too.

While this in no way proves a conspiracy, it does pretty much prove we don\u0027t know the whole story.  I admit the most likely explanation is the Bush Admin. was trying to cover up their mistakes and incompetence, but either way what we all consider the \"official story\" almost certainly is incomplete (at best).  Plus, the commission report has a huge section redacted.\n\n2)  I don\u0027t understand how the most powerful military in the history of everything allowed a direct strike on its headquarters without raising a single defense.\n\n3)  The attacks would not have been possible without the war games going on regarding multiple hijackings.  That a never-seen-before type of attack happened at the exact same time we were drilling for that never-seen-before type of attack is very hard to swallow as a coincidence.\n\n4)  I too am very skeptical of random internet claims, so maybe these are complete fabrications, but I haven\u0027t seen them completely debunked.  I\u0027m talking specifically that the Administration quit flying commercially a month before 9/11, that they took the anti-Anthrax pill right before 9/11, that Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon lost billions of dollars of unaccounted money right before 9/11, that several of the hijackers lived right down the street from NSA headquarters, that many other countries warned us about it beforehand, other high-jackers appeared to live lives completely in contrast to that of a devout Muslim, that a bunch of people with Mossad ties were caught filming and celebrating the attacks, Sibel Edmonds\u0027 claims, etc. etc.\n\nWhile obviously I don\u0027t expect anyone to go through every single point, I do wonder if there is a good clear reason to not be concerned with stuff like this at all.\n\n5)  I think we do know with reasonable certainty that the FBI stopped local agents from investigating future hijackers.  We also have pretty reliable testimony that rejected visas for these hijackers were reversed from higher ups.  We also know that the PATRIOT Act appeared fully written at mind-blowing speed.  Should either of these facts cause me to be suspicious?\n\n6)  WTC7 is not mentioned a single time in the entire commission report.  Maybe this was just a big-time fuck up of epic proportions, who knows?  Seems like there are a thousand things about that day that are simply written off as big-time fuck ups of epic proportions.  How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.  It\u0027s getting hard to see how this many years later, revealing this information would still put active spies at risk or otherwise legitimately threaten the safety of Americans generally.  For instance, why can\u0027t they release any of the camera angles of the Pentagon attack that would have showed what happened, as opposed to just giving us one video with a blur on it?\n\n8)  Finally, I\u0027ll say the one place I disagreed with you was how you glossed over the \u0027who benefits\u0027 argument.  The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5280537352605774,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5623804407171877,"sentiment":"  Very positive"},"timestamp":1.430626987E9,"simScore":0.6013658160561401,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430629374E9,"simScore":0.754776770525476,"sentiment":"  Positive"},"timestamp":1.430632187E9,"simScore":0.6665413770058676,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.430635508E9,"simScore":0.5901705513376332,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":40,"links":[38],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"SargeantSasquatch","label":"That\u0027s reasonable.","duration":"","id":40,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_cqx9msk","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":38,"links":[37],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"That\u0027s such a weird thing to cite as evidence.

(Still it almost brings me farther down the rabbit hole.  If these war games weren\u0027t responsible for our inability to track hijacked planes and our lack of available fighters to scramble - as I was led to believe - then it makes our inability to do these things even more inexcusable.)\n\nThat was an interesting comparison to the housing collapse.  Like 9/11, those responsible for causing/preventing it gained tremendously while everyone else lost out.  Maybe that\u0027s the problem with the whole debate...does it really matter if tragedies were intentional or merely a felix culpa?  Or to put it another way, if failing to do one\u0027s job properly leads to great gains, doesn\u0027t that incentivize performance failure whether or not it was consciously intentional?  Shouldn\u0027t our outrage, criticism, and concerns be equal either way?  Should self-benefiting incompetence be accepted as a reasonable excuse, and as far as that goes, is self-benefiting incompetence even a legitimate concept?\n\nI am totally on board with the idea that the government by its very nature classifies way too much.  But I think it\u0027s fair to be skeptical of a story when the source of that story withholds valuable information, has a long history of dishonesty, and has at least in some cases lied about the exact events in question.\n\nSo yeah, thanks you\u0027ve definitely lessened my suspicions but have not quelled them entirely.  Just too much relies on this idea that the hijackers were all very competent while the US government was entirely incompetent - - despite having the US government having nearly every advantage.  While it could very well be true that the hijackers pulled off the most risky caper in history while the US suffered failure after failure after failure, on its face it feels unlikely to me.\n\n\u0026gt; This is the basic flaw with conspiracy theories: they presuppose a conclusion, and then find all evidence, no matter how flimsy, to prove them. \n\nAs much as I appreciated the rest of your post, this one missed its mark.  Not because I found it insulting, but because it was a fundamental misunderstanding of my position.  I\u0027m not saying a conspiracy necessarily existed, and I\u0027m certainly not advocating any particular narrative of events.  I\u0027m the opposite of what you are saying - - I oppose the presumed conclusion (that the government story is 100% true) and I reject how any flimsy evidence is regarded as proof.  (For instance, does any reasonable person really believe the story they found a hijacker\u0027s passport in tact in the 9/11 ruins?  That can\u0027t possibly be legit.)  My position is simply that this is one of the most important events in modern history and has never been properly investigated.  Never.  Given those circumstances, it seems foolish to go around believing any version of events with reasonable certainty.\n\n\u0026gt;  by imagining perpetrators so diabolically cunning they would make a James Bond villain blush,\n\nThis is where anti-conspiracy people hold a double standard.  There\u0027s no explanation for the events of 9/11 that doesn\u0027t involve diabolical cunning.  You can\u0027t say a flaw in one theory is that involves diabolic cunning when the theory you support also involves diabolical cunning.\n\nAnyhow, again, thanks for the thoughtful response and it did make me rethink a number of things.","duration":"","id":28,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_cqwcxng","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":27,"links":[18],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"I\u0027ll try briefly responding to each of your points. I feel like the only way you can really be convinced is to review some of the sites I linked as they are pretty thorough and well-researched.\n\n1. As you say, it is more plausible to assume negligence over malevolence. 9/11 was, from the governments perspective, a catastrophic fuck up on their part. I have no doubt that on 9/11 when it became clear that this was not some terrible accident but in fact a terrorist attack, politicians of all levels went into complete CYA (cover your ass) mode. Just look at the Benghazi incident - orders of magnitude less impactful than 9/11, but all the same CYA behavior in full display. The 9/11 Commission was undoubtedly seen as a threat to those in power, and highly politicized as a result. Sadly, this tends to be the rule rather than the exception.\n\n2. You could say the same thing about the housing collapse. After the fact it seemed obviously preventable. Credit default swaps in hindsight seem as if they were designed by a mad man, yet before the event they were heralded as an amazing innovation in risk management. History is filled with these \u0027black swan\u0027 moments, and it\u0027s no surprise they are a hotbed of conspiracy theories. They seemingly come from nowhere and have an enormous effect. It would be strange if there *weren\u0027t* anomalies or suspicious qualities to them. If they weren\u0027t anomalous they wouldn\u0027t be a black swan event. In the end the cause is always the same: hubris and ignorance in equal parts.\n\n3. The war games were an interesting anomaly, at least on the surface. This is far too large a topic for me to go over in this post, but for an excellent dissection of it, check out this [link](http://www.911myths.com/index.php/War_Games). In short, the claims initially made for war games that seemed to eerily mimic 9/11 on 9/11 either weren\u0027t what people said they were, or did not actually occur on 9/11. They did conduct a war game involving a hijacked airliner, but it was nothing like what occurred on 9/11, so very little confusion actually existed. As you might imagine, the military is quite aware of the concern that an actual attack could coincide with a simulated attack, so they very likely have procedures for dealing with such a scenario. Lastly - and this is me completely hypothesizing - but war games tend to be highly publicized before occurring, presumably to alert other countries to avoid confusion. It\u0027s not out of the question to assume that hijackers shrewdly chose that date in order to help further the chances of success. A far more simple explanation than the government being involved in the attacks.\n\n4. Without looking them up, I can say that the \u0027unaccountable billions of dollars\u0027 claim was disproven. As for the others, they sound like hearsay - not concrete claims or evidence, simply \u0027weird\u0027 stuff. I remember reading about Sibel Edmond\u0027s story, but as I recall, it was more her whistleblowing government incompetence and negligence rather than ever suggesting the attacks were a government plot. \n\n5. You\u0027re going to need produce some sources on this. Doing some looking around, the visa situation seemed fairly typical - mostly tourist or student visas. There appears to be no controversy here, except for some visas being approved when they should been denied. Again, a case where negligence, incompetence, and simply being understaffed for the job, provides a more plausible explanation than collusion in the plot.\n\n6. WTC7 was really only incidental to the attacks. It was damaged by falling debris and uncontrolled fires, then collapsed. To make it anything more than an anomaly, you would have to make a case for why it needed to be demolished in the first place, and how that would have occurred.\n\n7. The government loves classifying things. They will classify entirely innocuous things and have been criticized repeatedly for that. Again, a case of CYA: if it looks like it should be classified, you have more incentive to do it than to not do it. As Snowden showed, however, it only takes one rebellious systems administrator to blow the thing wide open. It\u0027s hard to imagine someone not leaking some damning classified evidence at some point.\n\n8. The President allowed terrorist attacks to happen so could get reelected? That seems a rather risky campaign move. In hindsight you can say he benefited from it, but before the fact I doubt you could make a good case that being caught off guard during the worst attack on the US in history, while reading *My Pet Goat*, would be a solid path for reelection. Yes of course, corporations or arms of the government involved in defense will get a boost during wartime, but that logic gets you nowhere. It means that every war or precusor to war could be a conspiracy concocted by one or more of these groups.

Maybe this was just a big-time fuck up of epic proportions, who knows?  Seems like there are a thousand things about that day that are simply written off as big-time fuck ups of epic proportions.  How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.  It\u0027s getting hard to see how this many years later, revealing this information would still put active spies at risk or otherwise legitimately threaten the safety of Americans generally.

The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5280537352605774,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5623804407171877,"sentiment":"  Very positive"},"timestamp":1.430626987E9,"simScore":0.6013658160561401,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430629374E9,"simScore":0.754776770525476,"sentiment":"  Positive"},"timestamp":1.430632187E9,"simScore":0.6665413770058676,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.430635508E9,"simScore":0.6548716659843922,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":41,"links":[18],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"swearrengen","label":"\u0026gt; ... in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?\n\nI found this funny and intriguing - but on reflection not so bizarre if true.\n\nThe odds of this happening at first shock the mind as being \"1 in billions\", and therefore impossible to be a coincidence.

But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5280537352605774,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.6381783710983362,"sentiment":"  Very positive"},"timestamp":1.430622402E9,"simScore":0.6937094322846362,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":43,"links":[42],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Fradra","label":"But you cant compare it to that, those fronts were locked in A versus B, two large countries.

That a never-seen-before type of attack happened at the exact same time we were drilling for that never-seen-before type of attack is very hard to swallow as a coincidence.\n\n4)  I too am very skeptical of random internet claims, so maybe these are complete fabrications, but I haven\u0027t seen them completely debunked.  I\u0027m talking specifically that the Administration quit flying commercially a month before 9/11, that they took the anti-Anthrax pill right before 9/11, that Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon lost billions of dollars of unaccounted money right before 9/11, that several of the hijackers lived right down the street from NSA headquarters, that many other countries warned us about it beforehand, other high-jackers appeared to live lives completely in contrast to that of a devout Muslim, that a bunch of people with Mossad ties were caught filming and celebrating the attacks, Sibel Edmonds\u0027 claims, etc. etc.\n\nWhile obviously I don\u0027t expect anyone to go through every single point, I do wonder if there is a good clear reason to not be concerned with stuff like this at all.\n\n5)  I think we do know with reasonable certainty that the FBI stopped local agents from investigating future hijackers.  We also have pretty reliable testimony that rejected visas for these hijackers were reversed from higher ups.  We also know that the PATRIOT Act appeared fully written at mind-blowing speed.

Maybe this was just a big-time fuck up of epic proportions, who knows?  Seems like there are a thousand things about that day that are simply written off as big-time fuck ups of epic proportions.  How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.  It\u0027s getting hard to see how this many years later, revealing this information would still put active spies at risk or otherwise legitimately threaten the safety of Americans generally.

The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.

Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.

Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.

They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5280537352605774,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.6381783710983362,"sentiment":"  Very positive"},"timestamp":1.430622402E9,"simScore":0.6937094322846362,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430624819E9,"simScore":0.7550530111535437,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":45,"links":[18],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Vox_Imperatoris","label":"\u0026gt; Plus, the commission report has a huge section redacted.\n\nThis section very likely shows that much of the funding for the hijackers was given by influential people in Saudi Arabia, our \"ally\".

As someone who lost your skepticism of 9/11, and very capable of clear, convincing, and thoughtful writing, maybe you could help me lose my skepticism too.  Like I already agree with you on most of your points...I too don\u0027t give much credence to stuff like analyzing the Pentagon debris or alleged experts talking about building structures.\n\n1)  Key members of the Commission say they were lied to and that the whole project was underfunded.  While this in no way proves a conspiracy, it does pretty much prove we don\u0027t know the whole story.  I admit the most likely explanation is the Bush Admin. was trying to cover up their mistakes and incompetence, but either way what we all consider the \"official story\" almost certainly is incomplete (at best).  Plus, the commission report has a huge section redacted.\n\n2)  I don\u0027t understand how the most powerful military in the history of everything allowed a direct strike on its headquarters without raising a single defense.\n\n3)  The attacks would not have been possible without the war games going on regarding multiple hijackings.  That a never-seen-before type of attack happened at the exact same time we were drilling for that never-seen-before type of attack is very hard to swallow as a coincidence.\n\n4)  I too am very skeptical of random internet claims, so maybe these are complete fabrications, but I haven\u0027t seen them completely debunked.  I\u0027m talking specifically that the Administration quit flying commercially a month before 9/11, that they took the anti-Anthrax pill right before 9/11, that Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon lost billions of dollars of unaccounted money right before 9/11, that several of the hijackers lived right down the street from NSA headquarters, that many other countries warned us about it beforehand, other high-jackers appeared to live lives completely in contrast to that of a devout Muslim, that a bunch of people with Mossad ties were caught filming and celebrating the attacks, Sibel Edmonds\u0027 claims, etc. etc.\n\nWhile obviously I don\u0027t expect anyone to go through every single point, I do wonder if there is a good clear reason to not be concerned with stuff like this at all.\n\n5)  I think we do know with reasonable certainty that the FBI stopped local agents from investigating future hijackers.  We also have pretty reliable testimony that rejected visas for these hijackers were reversed from higher ups.  We also know that the PATRIOT Act appeared fully written at mind-blowing speed.  Should either of these facts cause me to be suspicious?\n\n6)  WTC7 is not mentioned a single time in the entire commission report.  Maybe this was just a big-time fuck up of epic proportions, who knows?  Seems like there are a thousand things about that day that are simply written off as big-time fuck ups of epic proportions.  How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.  It\u0027s getting hard to see how this many years later, revealing this information would still put active spies at risk or otherwise legitimately threaten the safety of Americans generally.  For instance, why can\u0027t they release any of the camera angles of the Pentagon attack that would have showed what happened, as opposed to just giving us one video with a blur on it?\n\n8)  Finally, I\u0027ll say the one place I disagreed with you was how you glossed over the \u0027who benefits\u0027 argument.  The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis.

As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object.

Like I already agree with you on most of your points...I too don\u0027t give much credence to stuff like analyzing the Pentagon debris or alleged experts talking about building structures.\n\n1)  Key members of the Commission say they were lied to and that the whole project was underfunded.  While this in no way proves a conspiracy, it does pretty much prove we don\u0027t know the whole story.  I admit the most likely explanation is the Bush Admin. was trying to cover up their mistakes and incompetence, but either way what we all consider the \"official story\" almost certainly is incomplete (at best).  Plus, the commission report has a huge section redacted.\n\n2)  I don\u0027t understand how the most powerful military in the history of everything allowed a direct strike on its headquarters without raising a single defense.\n\n3)  The attacks would not have been possible without the war games going on regarding multiple hijackings.  That a never-seen-before type of attack happened at the exact same time we were drilling for that never-seen-before type of attack is very hard to swallow as a coincidence.\n\n4)  I too am very skeptical of random internet claims, so maybe these are complete fabrications, but I haven\u0027t seen them completely debunked.  I\u0027m talking specifically that the Administration quit flying commercially a month before 9/11, that they took the anti-Anthrax pill right before 9/11, that Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon lost billions of dollars of unaccounted money right before 9/11, that several of the hijackers lived right down the street from NSA headquarters, that many other countries warned us about it beforehand, other high-jackers appeared to live lives completely in contrast to that of a devout Muslim, that a bunch of people with Mossad ties were caught filming and celebrating the attacks, Sibel Edmonds\u0027 claims, etc. etc.\n\nWhile obviously I don\u0027t expect anyone to go through every single point, I do wonder if there is a good clear reason to not be concerned with stuff like this at all.\n\n5)  I think we do know with reasonable certainty that the FBI stopped local agents from investigating future hijackers.  We also have pretty reliable testimony that rejected visas for these hijackers were reversed from higher ups.  We also know that the PATRIOT Act appeared fully written at mind-blowing speed.  Should either of these facts cause me to be suspicious?\n\n6)  WTC7 is not mentioned a single time in the entire commission report.  Maybe this was just a big-time fuck up of epic proportions, who knows?  Seems like there are a thousand things about that day that are simply written off as big-time fuck ups of epic proportions.  How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.  It\u0027s getting hard to see how this many years later, revealing this information would still put active spies at risk or otherwise legitimately threaten the safety of Americans generally.  For instance, why can\u0027t they release any of the camera angles of the Pentagon attack that would have showed what happened, as opposed to just giving us one video with a blur on it?\n\n8)  Finally, I\u0027ll say the one place I disagreed with you was how you glossed over the \u0027who benefits\u0027 argument.  The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5280537352605774,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.7461734853278655,"sentiment":"  Very positive"},"timestamp":1.430621871E9,"simScore":0.666545913827226,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430623722E9,"simScore":0.7634402715911468,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":48,"links":[18],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"I-HATE-REDDITORS","label":"\u0026gt; WTC7 is not mentioned a single time in the entire commission report.

For instance, why can\u0027t they release any of the camera angles of the Pentagon attack that would have showed what happened, as opposed to just giving us one video with a blur on it?\n\n8)  Finally, I\u0027ll say the one place I disagreed with you was how you glossed over the \u0027who benefits\u0027 argument.  The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5280537352605774,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.6299458232068392,"sentiment":"  Very positive"},"timestamp":1.430634464E9,"simScore":0.7685536042558723,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":50,"links":[18],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"VirtualMoneyLover","label":"The #3 is always overlooked.

(I.e. it is crazy talk to leap to \"aha, therefore this suggests the US was behind it!\" - why doesn\u0027t it suggest someone at the radar station was asleep at the wheel or lazy, etc. you should investigate such possibilities before having any confidence on a massive conspiracy)\n\n3. Hijackers were obviously super coordinated - maybe they were able to learn about the training and figured it\u0027d be the best time to do the attack? Not evidence of US being behind the attack.\n\n4. You have listed that there are weird things that happened to happen right before the attack. Can you give us the whole picture, i.e. what other similar things happened longer before , and after, the attack, that were not followed up by 9/11 events? This will help us understand the frequency of such events.  For example, if 100% of all suspicious/embarassing government activity happened within 30 days prior to 9/11, and never before that or since, this would be pretty strong evidence. If however we learned that the government admits embarassing shit like losing money or taking unrelated precautions to things, frequently, then this would not be noteworthy.\n\n5. Looks like it took a few weeks - I think professional law makers can write shit pretty quick if the president is saying \"MAKE IT SO\".

But nothing is positive evidence of the US being behind the attack. If you determine that this is unjustifiably suspiciuos, your first step might be to go to level 1 conspiracy: someone had an interest in not mentinoing WTC7. Why would you jump to a pretty unrelated level 100 conspiracy of \"the US governmentw as behind the whole thing\"? There isn\u0027t any reason to believe that in particular.\n\n7: Not positive evidence of US being behind the attack\n\n8: He\u0027s referring to all the businesses etc. that were destroyed. Nevertheless, you don\u0027t understand just yet because you admittedly didn\u0027t yet do the research on who lost out, so if you were rational your view would be \"Oh ok huh, well okay this isn\u0027t positive evidence that the US was behind the attack\".\n\nNow this may be the most important bit: I think I\u0027ve shown or cast severe doubt on upwards of 75% of the points you were using to believe in this. If you are rational, your confidence (whatever it was) in this belief would be severely weakened.

However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5280537352605774,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5860559060794281,"sentiment":"  Very positive"},{"index":52,"links":[51],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"heelspider","label":"What\u0027s good for the goose is good for the gander, though, right?\n\nI mean, here\u0027s the thing.

If you determine that this is unjustifiably suspiciuos, your first step might be to go to level 1 conspiracy: someone had an interest in not mentinoing WTC7. Why would you jump to a pretty unrelated level 100 conspiracy of \"the US governmentw as behind the whole thing\"? There isn\u0027t any reason to believe that in particular.\n\n7: Not positive evidence of US being behind the attack\n\n8: He\u0027s referring to all the businesses etc. that were destroyed.

If you are rational, your confidence (whatever it was) in this belief would be severely weakened.

As someone who lost your skepticism of 9/11, and very capable of clear, convincing, and thoughtful writing, maybe you could help me lose my skepticism too.  Like I already agree with you on most of your points...I too don\u0027t give much credence to stuff like analyzing the Pentagon debris or alleged experts talking about building structures.\n\n1)  Key members of the Commission say they were lied to and that the whole project was underfunded.  While this in no way proves a conspiracy, it does pretty much prove we don\u0027t know the whole story.  I admit the most likely explanation is the Bush Admin. was trying to cover up their mistakes and incompetence, but either way what we all consider the \"official story\" almost certainly is incomplete (at best).  Plus, the commission report has a huge section redacted.\n\n2)  I don\u0027t understand how the most powerful military in the history of everything allowed a direct strike on its headquarters without raising a single defense.\n\n3)  The attacks would not have been possible without the war games going on regarding multiple hijackings.  That a never-seen-before type of attack happened at the exact same time we were drilling for that never-seen-before type of attack is very hard to swallow as a coincidence.\n\n4)  I too am very skeptical of random internet claims, so maybe these are complete fabrications, but I haven\u0027t seen them completely debunked.  I\u0027m talking specifically that the Administration quit flying commercially a month before 9/11, that they took the anti-Anthrax pill right before 9/11, that Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon lost billions of dollars of unaccounted money right before 9/11, that several of the hijackers lived right down the street from NSA headquarters, that many other countries warned us about it beforehand, other high-jackers appeared to live lives completely in contrast to that of a devout Muslim, that a bunch of people with Mossad ties were caught filming and celebrating the attacks, Sibel Edmonds\u0027 claims, etc. etc.\n\nWhile obviously I don\u0027t expect anyone to go through every single point, I do wonder if there is a good clear reason to not be concerned with stuff like this at all.\n\n5)  I think we do know with reasonable certainty that the FBI stopped local agents from investigating future hijackers.  We also have pretty reliable testimony that rejected visas for these hijackers were reversed from higher ups.  We also know that the PATRIOT Act appeared fully written at mind-blowing speed.  Should either of these facts cause me to be suspicious?\n\n6)  WTC7 is not mentioned a single time in the entire commission report.  Maybe this was just a big-time fuck up of epic proportions, who knows?  Seems like there are a thousand things about that day that are simply written off as big-time fuck ups of epic proportions.  How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.  It\u0027s getting hard to see how this many years later, revealing this information would still put active spies at risk or otherwise legitimately threaten the safety of Americans generally.  For instance, why can\u0027t they release any of the camera angles of the Pentagon attack that would have showed what happened, as opposed to just giving us one video with a blur on it?\n\n8)  Finally, I\u0027ll say the one place I disagreed with you was how you glossed over the \u0027who benefits\u0027 argument.  The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)?

These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions.

In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose.

How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.  It\u0027s getting hard to see how this many years later, revealing this information would still put active spies at risk or otherwise legitimately threaten the safety of Americans generally.  For instance, why can\u0027t they release any of the camera angles of the Pentagon attack that would have showed what happened, as opposed to just giving us one video with a blur on it?\n\n8)  Finally, I\u0027ll say the one place I disagreed with you was how you glossed over the \u0027who benefits\u0027 argument.  The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5280537352605774,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5860559060794281,"sentiment":"  Very positive"},"timestamp":1.430617619E9,"simScore":0.6930574509392302,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.430618748E9,"simScore":0.5733373608206813,"sentiment":"  Positive"},{"index":54,"links":[53],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"heelspider","label":"Just because I said I\u0027d like my view changed in no way means that I am going to swallow any argument tossed my way.

(I.e. it is crazy talk to leap to \"aha, therefore this suggests the US was behind it!\" - why doesn\u0027t it suggest someone at the radar station was asleep at the wheel or lazy, etc. you should investigate such possibilities before having any confidence on a massive conspiracy)\n\n3. Hijackers were obviously super coordinated - maybe they were able to learn about the training and figured it\u0027d be the best time to do the attack? Not evidence of US being behind the attack.\n\n4. You have listed that there are weird things that happened to happen right before the attack. Can you give us the whole picture, i.e. what other similar things happened longer before , and after, the attack, that were not followed up by 9/11 events? This will help us understand the frequency of such events.  For example, if 100% of all suspicious/embarassing government activity happened within 30 days prior to 9/11, and never before that or since, this would be pretty strong evidence. If however we learned that the government admits embarassing shit like losing money or taking unrelated precautions to things, frequently, then this would not be noteworthy.\n\n5. Looks like it took a few weeks - I think professional law makers can write shit pretty quick if the president is saying \"MAKE IT SO\". Nevertheless it was still heavily flawed and lots of parts of it we crossed out before passing \u0026amp; more struck down since. Re: approving visas you\u0027d have to look at the overall rate of \"overruled\" visas - does it happen all the time?

But nothing is positive evidence of the US being behind the attack. If you determine that this is unjustifiably suspiciuos, your first step might be to go to level 1 conspiracy: someone had an interest in not mentinoing WTC7. Why would you jump to a pretty unrelated level 100 conspiracy of \"the US governmentw as behind the whole thing\"? There isn\u0027t any reason to believe that in particular.\n\n7: Not positive evidence of US being behind the attack\n\n8: He\u0027s referring to all the businesses etc. that were destroyed. Nevertheless, you don\u0027t understand just yet because you admittedly didn\u0027t yet do the research on who lost out, so if you were rational your view would be \"Oh ok huh, well okay this isn\u0027t positive evidence that the US was behind the attack\".\n\nNow this may be the most important bit: I think I\u0027ve shown or cast severe doubt on upwards of 75% of the points you were using to believe in this. If you are rational, your confidence (whatever it was) in this belief would be severely weakened.

Like I already agree with you on most of your points...I too don\u0027t give much credence to stuff like analyzing the Pentagon debris or alleged experts talking about building structures.\n\n1)  Key members of the Commission say they were lied to and that the whole project was underfunded.  While this in no way proves a conspiracy, it does pretty much prove we don\u0027t know the whole story.  I admit the most likely explanation is the Bush Admin. was trying to cover up their mistakes and incompetence, but either way what we all consider the \"official story\" almost certainly is incomplete (at best).  Plus, the commission report has a huge section redacted.\n\n2)  I don\u0027t understand how the most powerful military in the history of everything allowed a direct strike on its headquarters without raising a single defense.\n\n3)  The attacks would not have been possible without the war games going on regarding multiple hijackings.  That a never-seen-before type of attack happened at the exact same time we were drilling for that never-seen-before type of attack is very hard to swallow as a coincidence.\n\n4)  I too am very skeptical of random internet claims, so maybe these are complete fabrications, but I haven\u0027t seen them completely debunked.  I\u0027m talking specifically that the Administration quit flying commercially a month before 9/11, that they took the anti-Anthrax pill right before 9/11, that Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon lost billions of dollars of unaccounted money right before 9/11, that several of the hijackers lived right down the street from NSA headquarters, that many other countries warned us about it beforehand, other high-jackers appeared to live lives completely in contrast to that of a devout Muslim, that a bunch of people with Mossad ties were caught filming and celebrating the attacks, Sibel Edmonds\u0027 claims, etc. etc.\n\nWhile obviously I don\u0027t expect anyone to go through every single point, I do wonder if there is a good clear reason to not be concerned with stuff like this at all.\n\n5)  I think we do know with reasonable certainty that the FBI stopped local agents from investigating future hijackers.  We also have pretty reliable testimony that rejected visas for these hijackers were reversed from higher ups.  We also know that the PATRIOT Act appeared fully written at mind-blowing speed.  Should either of these facts cause me to be suspicious?\n\n6)  WTC7 is not mentioned a single time in the entire commission report.

For instance, why can\u0027t they release any of the camera angles of the Pentagon attack that would have showed what happened, as opposed to just giving us one video with a blur on it?\n\n8)  Finally, I\u0027ll say the one place I disagreed with you was how you glossed over the \u0027who benefits\u0027 argument.  The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5280537352605774,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5860559060794281,"sentiment":"  Very positive"},"timestamp":1.430617619E9,"simScore":0.6930574509392302,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.430618748E9,"simScore":0.5733373608206813,"sentiment":"  Positive"},"timestamp":1.430619074E9,"simScore":0.6077015265241448,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430621331E9,"simScore":0.6237171902458856,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":56,"links":[55],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"heelspider","label":"For the record, the context was me asking who was as powerful as the Bush Administration and the military complex that ended up losing out after 9/11...that\u0027s when you said do the research.\n\nAs for your main point, it\u0027s not a question which can be answered mathematically.

The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5280537352605774,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5860559060794281,"sentiment":"  Very positive"},"timestamp":1.430617619E9,"simScore":0.6930574509392302,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.430618748E9,"simScore":0.5733373608206813,"sentiment":"  Positive"},"timestamp":1.430619074E9,"simScore":0.6077015265241448,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430621331E9,"simScore":0.6237171902458856,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430622004E9,"simScore":0.5820532670011902,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":57,"links":[53],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Mozared","label":"You seem very dead set on this \"there isn\u0027t positive evidence that...\"-attitude, which I think is a bit of a strange way of looking at things.

In a similar fashion though, I readily concede that the same goes for heelspider: he hasn\u0027t given me any evidence that any of the things he has mentioned are true at all.

Incompetence, not positive evidence that US was behind the attack. (I.e. it is crazy talk to leap to \"aha, therefore this suggests the US was behind it!\" - why doesn\u0027t it suggest someone at the radar station was asleep at the wheel or lazy, etc. you should investigate such possibilities before having any confidence on a massive conspiracy)\n\n3. Hijackers were obviously super coordinated - maybe they were able to learn about the training and figured it\u0027d be the best time to do the attack? Not evidence of US being behind the attack.\n\n4. You have listed that there are weird things that happened to happen right before the attack. Can you give us the whole picture, i.e. what other similar things happened longer before , and after, the attack, that were not followed up by 9/11 events? This will help us understand the frequency of such events.  For example, if 100% of all suspicious/embarassing government activity happened within 30 days prior to 9/11, and never before that or since, this would be pretty strong evidence. If however we learned that the government admits embarassing shit like losing money or taking unrelated precautions to things, frequently, then this would not be noteworthy.\n\n5. Looks like it took a few weeks - I think professional law makers can write shit pretty quick if the president is saying \"MAKE IT SO\". Nevertheless it was still heavily flawed and lots of parts of it we crossed out before passing \u0026amp; more struck down since. Re: approving visas you\u0027d have to look at the overall rate of \"overruled\" visas - does it happen all the time?

But nothing is positive evidence of the US being behind the attack. If you determine that this is unjustifiably suspiciuos, your first step might be to go to level 1 conspiracy: someone had an interest in not mentinoing WTC7. Why would you jump to a pretty unrelated level 100 conspiracy of \"the US governmentw as behind the whole thing\"? There isn\u0027t any reason to believe that in particular.\n\n7: Not positive evidence of US being behind the attack\n\n8: He\u0027s referring to all the businesses etc. that were destroyed. Nevertheless, you don\u0027t understand just yet because you admittedly didn\u0027t yet do the research on who lost out, so if you were rational your view would be \"Oh ok huh, well okay this isn\u0027t positive evidence that the US was behind the attack\".\n\nNow this may be the most important bit: I think I\u0027ve shown or cast severe doubt on upwards of 75% of the points you were using to believe in this. If you are rational, your confidence (whatever it was) in this belief would be severely weakened.

As someone who lost your skepticism of 9/11, and very capable of clear, convincing, and thoughtful writing, maybe you could help me lose my skepticism too.  Like I already agree with you on most of your points...I too don\u0027t give much credence to stuff like analyzing the Pentagon debris or alleged experts talking about building structures.\n\n1)  Key members of the Commission say they were lied to and that the whole project was underfunded.  While this in no way proves a conspiracy, it does pretty much prove we don\u0027t know the whole story.  I admit the most likely explanation is the Bush Admin. was trying to cover up their mistakes and incompetence, but either way what we all consider the \"official story\" almost certainly is incomplete (at best).  Plus, the commission report has a huge section redacted.\n\n2)  I don\u0027t understand how the most powerful military in the history of everything allowed a direct strike on its headquarters without raising a single defense.\n\n3)  The attacks would not have been possible without the war games going on regarding multiple hijackings.  That a never-seen-before type of attack happened at the exact same time we were drilling for that never-seen-before type of attack is very hard to swallow as a coincidence.\n\n4)  I too am very skeptical of random internet claims, so maybe these are complete fabrications, but I haven\u0027t seen them completely debunked.  I\u0027m talking specifically that the Administration quit flying commercially a month before 9/11, that they took the anti-Anthrax pill right before 9/11, that Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon lost billions of dollars of unaccounted money right before 9/11, that several of the hijackers lived right down the street from NSA headquarters, that many other countries warned us about it beforehand, other high-jackers appeared to live lives completely in contrast to that of a devout Muslim, that a bunch of people with Mossad ties were caught filming and celebrating the attacks, Sibel Edmonds\u0027 claims, etc. etc.\n\nWhile obviously I don\u0027t expect anyone to go through every single point, I do wonder if there is a good clear reason to not be concerned with stuff like this at all.\n\n5)  I think we do know with reasonable certainty that the FBI stopped local agents from investigating future hijackers.  We also have pretty reliable testimony that rejected visas for these hijackers were reversed from higher ups.  We also know that the PATRIOT Act appeared fully written at mind-blowing speed.  Should either of these facts cause me to be suspicious?\n\n6)  WTC7 is not mentioned a single time in the entire commission report.  Maybe this was just a big-time fuck up of epic proportions, who knows?  Seems like there are a thousand things about that day that are simply written off as big-time fuck ups of epic proportions.  How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.

As someone who lost your skepticism of 9/11, and very capable of clear, convincing, and thoughtful writing, maybe you could help me lose my skepticism too.  Like I already agree with you on most of your points...I too don\u0027t give much credence to stuff like analyzing the Pentagon debris or alleged experts talking about building structures.\n\n1)  Key members of the Commission say they were lied to and that the whole project was underfunded.  While this in no way proves a conspiracy, it does pretty much prove we don\u0027t know the whole story.  I admit the most likely explanation is the Bush Admin. was trying to cover up their mistakes and incompetence, but either way what we all consider the \"official story\" almost certainly is incomplete (at best).  Plus, the commission report has a huge section redacted.\n\n2)  I don\u0027t understand how the most powerful military in the history of everything allowed a direct strike on its headquarters without raising a single defense.\n\n3)  The attacks would not have been possible without the war games going on regarding multiple hijackings.  That a never-seen-before type of attack happened at the exact same time we were drilling for that never-seen-before type of attack is very hard to swallow as a coincidence.\n\n4)  I too am very skeptical of random internet claims, so maybe these are complete fabrications, but I haven\u0027t seen them completely debunked.  I\u0027m talking specifically that the Administration quit flying commercially a month before 9/11, that they took the anti-Anthrax pill right before 9/11, that Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon lost billions of dollars of unaccounted money right before 9/11, that several of the hijackers lived right down the street from NSA headquarters, that many other countries warned us about it beforehand, other high-jackers appeared to live lives completely in contrast to that of a devout Muslim, that a bunch of people with Mossad ties were caught filming and celebrating the attacks, Sibel Edmonds\u0027 claims, etc. etc.\n\nWhile obviously I don\u0027t expect anyone to go through every single point, I do wonder if there is a good clear reason to not be concerned with stuff like this at all.\n\n5)  I think we do know with reasonable certainty that the FBI stopped local agents from investigating future hijackers.  We also have pretty reliable testimony that rejected visas for these hijackers were reversed from higher ups.  We also know that the PATRIOT Act appeared fully written at mind-blowing speed.  Should either of these facts cause me to be suspicious?\n\n6)  WTC7 is not mentioned a single time in the entire commission report.  Maybe this was just a big-time fuck up of epic proportions, who knows?  Seems like there are a thousand things about that day that are simply written off as big-time fuck ups of epic proportions.  How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.  It\u0027s getting hard to see how this many years later, revealing this information would still put active spies at risk or otherwise legitimately threaten the safety of Americans generally.  For instance, why can\u0027t they release any of the camera angles of the Pentagon attack that would have showed what happened, as opposed to just giving us one video with a blur on it?\n\n8)  Finally, I\u0027ll say the one place I disagreed with you was how you glossed over the \u0027who benefits\u0027 argument.  The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5280537352605774,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5860559060794281,"sentiment":"  Very positive"},"timestamp":1.430617619E9,"simScore":0.6930574509392302,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.430618748E9,"simScore":0.5733373608206813,"sentiment":"  Positive"},"timestamp":1.430619074E9,"simScore":0.5795892946350523,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430621338E9,"simScore":0.5508693341666787,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":59,"links":[57],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"vehementi","label":"And yes of course I can prove the moon is larger than an elephant.

As someone who lost your skepticism of 9/11, and very capable of clear, convincing, and thoughtful writing, maybe you could help me lose my skepticism too.  Like I already agree with you on most of your points...I too don\u0027t give much credence to stuff like analyzing the Pentagon debris or alleged experts talking about building structures.\n\n1)  Key members of the Commission say they were lied to and that the whole project was underfunded.  While this in no way proves a conspiracy, it does pretty much prove we don\u0027t know the whole story.  I admit the most likely explanation is the Bush Admin. was trying to cover up their mistakes and incompetence, but either way what we all consider the \"official story\" almost certainly is incomplete (at best).  Plus, the commission report has a huge section redacted.\n\n2)  I don\u0027t understand how the most powerful military in the history of everything allowed a direct strike on its headquarters without raising a single defense.\n\n3)  The attacks would not have been possible without the war games going on regarding multiple hijackings.  That a never-seen-before type of attack happened at the exact same time we were drilling for that never-seen-before type of attack is very hard to swallow as a coincidence.\n\n4)  I too am very skeptical of random internet claims, so maybe these are complete fabrications, but I haven\u0027t seen them completely debunked.  I\u0027m talking specifically that the Administration quit flying commercially a month before 9/11, that they took the anti-Anthrax pill right before 9/11, that Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon lost billions of dollars of unaccounted money right before 9/11, that several of the hijackers lived right down the street from NSA headquarters, that many other countries warned us about it beforehand, other high-jackers appeared to live lives completely in contrast to that of a devout Muslim, that a bunch of people with Mossad ties were caught filming and celebrating the attacks, Sibel Edmonds\u0027 claims, etc. etc.\n\nWhile obviously I don\u0027t expect anyone to go through every single point, I do wonder if there is a good clear reason to not be concerned with stuff like this at all.\n\n5)  I think we do know with reasonable certainty that the FBI stopped local agents from investigating future hijackers.  We also have pretty reliable testimony that rejected visas for these hijackers were reversed from higher ups.  We also know that the PATRIOT Act appeared fully written at mind-blowing speed.  Should either of these facts cause me to be suspicious?\n\n6)  WTC7 is not mentioned a single time in the entire commission report.  Maybe this was just a big-time fuck up of epic proportions, who knows?  Seems like there are a thousand things about that day that are simply written off as big-time fuck ups of epic proportions.  How many big-time fuck ups of epic proportions can one objective and rational person accept before getting at least suspicious that they actually weren\u0027t all fuck-ups?\n\n7)  There\u0027s still soooooo much classified about that day.  It\u0027s getting hard to see how this many years later, revealing this information would still put active spies at risk or otherwise legitimately threaten the safety of Americans generally.  For instance, why can\u0027t they release any of the camera angles of the Pentagon attack that would have showed what happened, as opposed to just giving us one video with a blur on it?\n\n8)  Finally, I\u0027ll say the one place I disagreed with you was how you glossed over the \u0027who benefits\u0027 argument.  The President who allowed 9/11 to happen got huge approval ratings and reelection.  Those under him got the wars and security measures they wanted.  The military which failed to stop the attacks got huge increases in money and two wars.  Hell, even the head of the CIA - the most obvious person to blame for the attacks - did not get fired, but instead got a medal.  From the White House to the intelligence sector to the military sector - - those responsible for failing to prevent the attacks all directly benefited from their own (alleged) failures.  You say there were an equal number of equally powerful losers, but I don\u0027t see who you are referring to at all, or how that is even possible.\n\nIn short, I\u0027d like to be like you and lose my skepticism for the 9/11 attacks on that day...I agree there\u0027s a lot of conspiracy stuff that is complete b.s., and a lot more of it that is over-emphasized while not being all that convincing.  Yet all the secrecy, all the failures to hold those who made the mistakes accountable, the lack of the events never being properly investigated, the staggering number of oddities, the rich rewards brought in to those entrusted with stopping such attacks, the complete reliance on government information for what happened that day...is there enough evidence or rational argument that might help me remove all these lingering doubts?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The President\u0027s father (former President and head of the CIA) was in a meeting with Bin Laden\u0027s family member the very morning of 9/11.  Yes, I know we\u0027ve all been told the rest of the Bin Laden family \"disowned\" Osama.  But still, in a world with billions of people, two family members of the leaders of the two warring sides doing business together while the attacks are happening...isn\u0027t that alone like the biggest bizarre coincidence in history?","duration":"","id":18,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw63sa","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":1,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"omrakt","label":"It\u0027s impossible to go through all the material linked and reply without writing for half the day, so I think you will be disappointed by the replies.\n\nI\u0027ve been through the whole 9/11 rigamarole myself, going from conspiracy theorist as a teen(not full on controlled demo craziness, but at least thinking the government had foreknowledge), to completely abandoning the view as I entered my 20s. If you spend enough time on the internet, you start to get a sense for narratives that are BS.\n\nSo instead of trying to go point to point, I will try to give a brief summary of the tactics used by conspiracy theorists and attempt to debunk them.\n\n1. Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented. I feel like the reason more people aren\u0027t 9/11 conspiracy theorists is they\u0027ve never bothered to look at all the information presented. Unless you have a well-honed BS detector and a desire to challenge your views ruthlessly, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into believing something that, on closer analysis, is completely ridiculous. Plus it can be painful and embarrassing to change your view. A lot of 9/11 conspiracy theorists never engage in that closer analysis, for various reasons, and so their views remain unchanged.\n\n","duration":"","id":1,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw0z3r","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430604735E9,"simScore":0.680519238738246,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5280537352605774,"sentiment":"  Very negative"},"timestamp":1.430615864E9,"simScore":0.5860559060794281,"sentiment":"  Very positive"},"timestamp":1.430617619E9,"simScore":0.6930574509392302,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.430618748E9,"simScore":0.5733373608206813,"sentiment":"  Positive"},"timestamp":1.430619074E9,"simScore":0.5795892946350523,"sentiment":"  Negative"},"timestamp":1.430621338E9,"simScore":0.698166638748215,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":60,"links":[18],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Newb_A_Lube","label":"Thank you.

A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet.

As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on.

In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there.

Large amounts of \u0027facts\u0027 which are completely false on closer analysis. I\u0027ve debated people about 9/11 in the past, and the favorite tactic appears to be linking to 500 articles about all the weird things that happened on 9/11. A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk. As long as they have at least one piece of convincing evidence, they will consider their theory unrebuked, not appreciating how much ground they gave.\n\n2. Over-reliance on bad intuitions. They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on. These questions are dismissed as mere speculation, but they actually form the foundation of any of these assertions. When thinking about it carefully, you find that 9/11 conspiracy theories are built upon a rotten base.\n\n4. Over emphasis on personal incentives and motives (i.e. who gained?). In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there. I should note that I don\u0027t think people who believe in various conspiracy theories are stupid, stubborn, or any other disparaging view. The internet has made it very easy for anyone to publish false information. But most people tend to trust what they read if at least appears credibly presented.

They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet.

They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3. Ignoring good intuitions. Questions like: how did a crew manage to wire up the world trade centers with explosives? Why hasn\u0027t any insider come forward, even anonymously, with evidence of the operation (Wikileaks would certainly not mind it)? Did the US government really need to concoct such a massive operation simply to get us into war? And so on.

In any event, be it tragedy or triumph, some will benefit and some will lose. Military contractors gained from 9/11, no doubt, but other companies were destroyed by it (both figuratively and literally). In both cases, there are very influential people who were winners, and very influential people who were losers. But 9/11 conspiracy theorists only focus on the people who gained, making it seem like a windfall when for the vast majority of people and companies it was utterly devastating.\n\n5. False appeals to experts. In any field, you can always find a large group of people who hold crazy views. In the climate change debate, people often cite the number of \u0027climate experts\u0027 who disagree with the idea that humans are responsible for climate change. They tend to ignore that these people are either a. not experts in the relevant field, but instead hold a degree that *seems* like it would be related to climate change or b. a very small minority compared with the experts who form the vast consensus view on climate change being largely the result of human behavior.\n\nI\u0027m starting to feel the fatigue setting in, so I will have to end it there.

A favorite trope is, for example, to say there were no airplane debris at the Pentagon crash site. They will carefully select photos which appear to suggest a plane did not in fact crash, and instead was, of course, a missile. However, if you actually review a more complete set of photos, you will find a massive amount of debris that are very clearly from the American Airlines jet. So you show them definitive proof that it was indeed a plane that hit, and they will either a. deny that the debris is that of a plane or b. concede that it was a plane, but then follow up with \"Well what about X, Y, Z I linked\"? Once you debunk X, Y, and Z, if you have the energy for that, you will get another fresh page of non-facts to debunk.

They will ask a question like \"Why didn\u0027t the wings sheer off the plane when it hit the Pentagon?\" It seems perfectly reasonable. As a kid you could remember when you threw one of those toy airplanes, and it struck a wall and the wings popped off from the shearing force of the impact. Except we are talking about a plane traveling at ~400 MPH, impacting a reinforced concrete building. The wings can\u0027t simply \u0027pop off\u0027 since they along with everything in the plane are traveling at 400 MPH, and will in fact disintegrate (for the most part) on impact with a sufficiently strong object. Our intuitions are good for many things, but we simply can\u0027t understand the extreme forces that occurred with either the Pentagon being struck, or the WTC towers being struck and then collapsing.\n\n3.

I\u0027d just like to know what else could potentially cause this.\n\nBefore I address the rest of your bullet points I want to say this: I don\u0027t think any of us have any idea exactly how powerful/far reaching the government is. I agree, it would be RIDICULOUSLY difficult to keep all of this under wraps, but that\u0027s not to say it\u0027s beyond the US Government\u0027s capabilities. Look at the NSA for example. It has been around since 1917, and has been conducting mass surveillance on US citizens since 1981. I\u0027m willing to bet that the Snowden-esque surveillance has been going on for quite a while, but it took over 30 years for this information to be leaked and there are THOUSANDS of NSA employees. 9/11 only happened 14 years ago, and thousands of people would not have been needed to make this work. Again, just spitballing.\n\n\u0026gt;Who did the work?  \n\nI don\u0027t know, and I\u0027m not going to pretend to. Who is digging through people\u0027s personal files unconstitutionally or carrying out torture at Guantanamo? (Granted those aren\u0027t as significant as a large-scale attack on your own people.) There are hundreds of millions of people in this country, and while I\u0027d like to believe there is a vast majority that would be appalled at the idea of propagating something like 9/11, I\u0027m also sure there\u0027s a number of people willing to look the other way for the right price.\n\n\u0026gt; How were they able to wire 2 buildings with 110 floors each without anyone noticing? No fresh drywall or paint noticed. No security tapes. Nothing.\n\nI don\u0027t believe the Twin Towers were a controlled demolition. I believe two planes were hijacked and flown into the towers and the heat from the jet fuel fires weakened the steel supports enough so that they buckled, and then gravity did the rest. I am absolutely not a JET FUEL CAN\u0027T MELT STEEL BEAMS conspiracy theorist. (And fun fact, burning magnesium IS hot enough to melt steel, and magnesium is a very common component in airplane wings.) I believe that WTC-7 may have been a controlled demolition. It came down seven hours after the Twin Towers and it started it\u0027s collapse from the bottom rather than the top. Seven hours amid complete chaos is enough time for an experienced team to plant charges and detonate them. \n\n\u0026gt;What was the plan if something went wrong, as happens from time to time in demolitions? What if the plane just clipped the building?\n\nAgain, I don\u0027t believe the Twin Towers fell as a result of a controlled demolition. I believe they fell because two planes flew into them. (I think it\u0027s a possibility that Al-Qaeda could have been contacted and instructed on where we were weak and how they could exploit those weaknesses, but I definitely believe that the hijackings happened as stated. That doesn\u0027t mean the government wasn\u0027t involved in my opinion. Also, if it happened in this way it would be MUCH easier to cover up, you would really only need one person making a call from a payphone.)\n\n\u0026gt; How many people would have been involved at each level? How much money would it take to keep EVERY SINGLE ONE of them quiet? Basically anyone involved would have enough proof to blow it wide open for, what would basically be the single biggest news story of all human history. Why hasn\u0027t that happened?\n\nHonestly, I don\u0027t think it would have to be that many. 50, maybe 100 at the very most. It could even be as low as 20. If it was a matter of the government instructing Al Qaeda on how to hijack a plane and where to fly that plane it may have only involved 2-3 people. (That\u0027s assuming there were no controlled demolitions.) A full scale attack like some of the conspiracy theorists out there like to imagine would have involved hundreds of people and probably would have been almost impossible to keep a secret. But a couple of phone calls and a small 10 man team of demolitions experts could potentially accomplish what I\u0027m arguing. Why has no one come forwards? It could be fear that the government might kill them, it could be the fact that they\u0027re getting paid marvelously so they have more to lose by coming forwards or it could be a combination of the two. Not everyone is as righteous as Edward Snowden. A lot of people just look out for themselves.

No fresh drywall or paint noticed. No security tapes. Nothing.\n\nI don\u0027t believe the Twin Towers were a controlled demolition. I believe two planes were hijacked and flown into the towers and the heat from the jet fuel fires weakened the steel supports enough so that they buckled, and then gravity did the rest. I am absolutely not a JET FUEL CAN\u0027T MELT STEEL BEAMS conspiracy theorist. (And fun fact, burning magnesium IS hot enough to melt steel, and magnesium is a very common component in airplane wings.) I believe that WTC-7 may have been a controlled demolition. It came down seven hours after the Twin Towers and it started it\u0027s collapse from the bottom rather than the top. Seven hours amid complete chaos is enough time for an experienced team to plant charges and detonate them. \n\n\u0026gt;What was the plan if something went wrong, as happens from time to time in demolitions? What if the plane just clipped the building?\n\nAgain, I don\u0027t believe the Twin Towers fell as a result of a controlled demolition. I believe they fell because two planes flew into them. (I think it\u0027s a possibility that Al-Qaeda could have been contacted and instructed on where we were weak and how they could exploit those weaknesses, but I definitely believe that the hijackings happened as stated. That doesn\u0027t mean the government wasn\u0027t involved in my opinion. Also, if it happened in this way it would be MUCH easier to cover up, you would really only need one person making a call from a payphone.)\n\n\u0026gt; How many people would have been involved at each level? How much money would it take to keep EVERY SINGLE ONE of them quiet? Basically anyone involved would have enough proof to blow it wide open for, what would basically be the single biggest news story of all human history. Why hasn\u0027t that happened?\n\nHonestly, I don\u0027t think it would have to be that many. 50, maybe 100 at the very most. It could even be as low as 20. If it was a matter of the government instructing Al Qaeda on how to hijack a plane and where to fly that plane it may have only involved 2-3 people. (That\u0027s assuming there were no controlled demolitions.) A full scale attack like some of the conspiracy theorists out there like to imagine would have involved hundreds of people and probably would have been almost impossible to keep a secret. But a couple of phone calls and a small 10 man team of demolitions experts could potentially accomplish what I\u0027m arguing. Why has no one come forwards? It could be fear that the government might kill them, it could be the fact that they\u0027re getting paid marvelously so they have more to lose by coming forwards or it could be a combination of the two. Not everyone is as righteous as Edward Snowden. A lot of people just look out for themselves. If each man on the supposed demolition crew is getting $10 million a year for him to keep his mouth shut then I can see them not coming forwards.\n\nThanks a ton for your response!","duration":"","id":117,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw0m1f","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":82,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"ryan_m","label":"Use Occam\u0027s Razor here.\n\nHow much money would they have made with all of these put options?

I agree, it would be RIDICULOUSLY difficult to keep all of this under wraps, but that\u0027s not to say it\u0027s beyond the US Government\u0027s capabilities. Look at the NSA for example. It has been around since 1917, and has been conducting mass surveillance on US citizens since 1981. I\u0027m willing to bet that the Snowden-esque surveillance has been going on for quite a while, but it took over 30 years for this information to be leaked and there are THOUSANDS of NSA employees. 9/11 only happened 14 years ago, and thousands of people would not have been needed to make this work.

No fresh drywall or paint noticed. No security tapes. Nothing.\n\nI don\u0027t believe the Twin Towers were a controlled demolition. I believe two planes were hijacked and flown into the towers and the heat from the jet fuel fires weakened the steel supports enough so that they buckled, and then gravity did the rest. I am absolutely not a JET FUEL CAN\u0027T MELT STEEL BEAMS conspiracy theorist. (And fun fact, burning magnesium IS hot enough to melt steel, and magnesium is a very common component in airplane wings.) I believe that WTC-7 may have been a controlled demolition.

I\u0027m operating under the \"what if\" assumption. I\u0027m really trying hard not to fall into the trap that a lot of conspiracy theorists find themselves in, and that is the trap of \"yeah, okay, but...\" What I mean by that is I don\u0027t ever want to come off as just discounting all pieces of evidence refuting my position while simultaneously just throwing up another theory.\n\nThat being said, I feel your response is based solely on the idea of \"it can\u0027t be true because no one has come forward yet.\" In terms of the stock market manipulation, I agree. It would have been incredibly risky and an obvious way of tracking down people involved. However, it still happened. I am absolutely not discounting the possibility of pure coincidence, but you have to admit it is a BIG coincidence. Perhaps the fact that it is just so obvious is enough to pull it off. Hide in plain sight and all that jazz. (Yeah I know that sounds like I\u0027m grasping for straws, I\u0027m just spitballing here.) I\u0027d just like to know what else could potentially cause this.\n\nBefore I address the rest of your bullet points I want to say this: I don\u0027t think any of us have any idea exactly how powerful/far reaching the government is. I agree, it would be RIDICULOUSLY difficult to keep all of this under wraps, but that\u0027s not to say it\u0027s beyond the US Government\u0027s capabilities. Look at the NSA for example. It has been around since 1917, and has been conducting mass surveillance on US citizens since 1981. I\u0027m willing to bet that the Snowden-esque surveillance has been going on for quite a while, but it took over 30 years for this information to be leaked and there are THOUSANDS of NSA employees. 9/11 only happened 14 years ago, and thousands of people would not have been needed to make this work. Again, just spitballing.\n\n\u0026gt;Who did the work?  \n\nI don\u0027t know, and I\u0027m not going to pretend to. Who is digging through people\u0027s personal files unconstitutionally or carrying out torture at Guantanamo? (Granted those aren\u0027t as significant as a large-scale attack on your own people.) There are hundreds of millions of people in this country, and while I\u0027d like to believe there is a vast majority that would be appalled at the idea of propagating something like 9/11, I\u0027m also sure there\u0027s a number of people willing to look the other way for the right price.\n\n\u0026gt; How were they able to wire 2 buildings with 110 floors each without anyone noticing? No fresh drywall or paint noticed. No security tapes. Nothing.\n\nI don\u0027t believe the Twin Towers were a controlled demolition. I believe two planes were hijacked and flown into the towers and the heat from the jet fuel fires weakened the steel supports enough so that they buckled, and then gravity did the rest. I am absolutely not a JET FUEL CAN\u0027T MELT STEEL BEAMS conspiracy theorist. (And fun fact, burning magnesium IS hot enough to melt steel, and magnesium is a very common component in airplane wings.) I believe that WTC-7 may have been a controlled demolition. It came down seven hours after the Twin Towers and it started it\u0027s collapse from the bottom rather than the top. Seven hours amid complete chaos is enough time for an experienced team to plant charges and detonate them. \n\n\u0026gt;What was the plan if something went wrong, as happens from time to time in demolitions? What if the plane just clipped the building?\n\nAgain, I don\u0027t believe the Twin Towers fell as a result of a controlled demolition. I believe they fell because two planes flew into them. (I think it\u0027s a possibility that Al-Qaeda could have been contacted and instructed on where we were weak and how they could exploit those weaknesses, but I definitely believe that the hijackings happened as stated. That doesn\u0027t mean the government wasn\u0027t involved in my opinion. Also, if it happened in this way it would be MUCH easier to cover up, you would really only need one person making a call from a payphone.)\n\n\u0026gt; How many people would have been involved at each level? How much money would it take to keep EVERY SINGLE ONE of them quiet? Basically anyone involved would have enough proof to blow it wide open for, what would basically be the single biggest news story of all human history. Why hasn\u0027t that happened?\n\nHonestly, I don\u0027t think it would have to be that many. 50, maybe 100 at the very most. It could even be as low as 20. If it was a matter of the government instructing Al Qaeda on how to hijack a plane and where to fly that plane it may have only involved 2-3 people. (That\u0027s assuming there were no controlled demolitions.) A full scale attack like some of the conspiracy theorists out there like to imagine would have involved hundreds of people and probably would have been almost impossible to keep a secret. But a couple of phone calls and a small 10 man team of demolitions experts could potentially accomplish what I\u0027m arguing. Why has no one come forwards? It could be fear that the government might kill them, it could be the fact that they\u0027re getting paid marvelously so they have more to lose by coming forwards or it could be a combination of the two. Not everyone is as righteous as Edward Snowden. A lot of people just look out for themselves.

It would have been incredibly risky and an obvious way of tracking down people involved. However, it still happened. I am absolutely not discounting the possibility of pure coincidence, but you have to admit it is a BIG coincidence. Perhaps the fact that it is just so obvious is enough to pull it off. Hide in plain sight and all that jazz. (Yeah I know that sounds like I\u0027m grasping for straws, I\u0027m just spitballing here.) I\u0027d just like to know what else could potentially cause this.\n\nBefore I address the rest of your bullet points I want to say this: I don\u0027t think any of us have any idea exactly how powerful/far reaching the government is. I agree, it would be RIDICULOUSLY difficult to keep all of this under wraps, but that\u0027s not to say it\u0027s beyond the US Government\u0027s capabilities. Look at the NSA for example. It has been around since 1917, and has been conducting mass surveillance on US citizens since 1981. I\u0027m willing to bet that the Snowden-esque surveillance has been going on for quite a while, but it took over 30 years for this information to be leaked and there are THOUSANDS of NSA employees. 9/11 only happened 14 years ago, and thousands of people would not have been needed to make this work. Again, just spitballing.\n\n\u0026gt;Who did the work?  \n\nI don\u0027t know, and I\u0027m not going to pretend to. Who is digging through people\u0027s personal files unconstitutionally or carrying out torture at Guantanamo? (Granted those aren\u0027t as significant as a large-scale attack on your own people.) There are hundreds of millions of people in this country, and while I\u0027d like to believe there is a vast majority that would be appalled at the idea of propagating something like 9/11, I\u0027m also sure there\u0027s a number of people willing to look the other way for the right price.\n\n\u0026gt; How were they able to wire 2 buildings with 110 floors each without anyone noticing? No fresh drywall or paint noticed. No security tapes. Nothing.\n\nI don\u0027t believe the Twin Towers were a controlled demolition. I believe two planes were hijacked and flown into the towers and the heat from the jet fuel fires weakened the steel supports enough so that they buckled, and then gravity did the rest. I am absolutely not a JET FUEL CAN\u0027T MELT STEEL BEAMS conspiracy theorist. (And fun fact, burning magnesium IS hot enough to melt steel, and magnesium is a very common component in airplane wings.) I believe that WTC-7 may have been a controlled demolition. It came down seven hours after the Twin Towers and it started it\u0027s collapse from the bottom rather than the top. Seven hours amid complete chaos is enough time for an experienced team to plant charges and detonate them. \n\n\u0026gt;What was the plan if something went wrong, as happens from time to time in demolitions? What if the plane just clipped the building?\n\nAgain, I don\u0027t believe the Twin Towers fell as a result of a controlled demolition. I believe they fell because two planes flew into them. (I think it\u0027s a possibility that Al-Qaeda could have been contacted and instructed on where we were weak and how they could exploit those weaknesses, but I definitely believe that the hijackings happened as stated. That doesn\u0027t mean the government wasn\u0027t involved in my opinion. Also, if it happened in this way it would be MUCH easier to cover up, you would really only need one person making a call from a payphone.)\n\n\u0026gt; How many people would have been involved at each level? How much money would it take to keep EVERY SINGLE ONE of them quiet? Basically anyone involved would have enough proof to blow it wide open for, what would basically be the single biggest news story of all human history. Why hasn\u0027t that happened?\n\nHonestly, I don\u0027t think it would have to be that many. 50, maybe 100 at the very most. It could even be as low as 20. If it was a matter of the government instructing Al Qaeda on how to hijack a plane and where to fly that plane it may have only involved 2-3 people. (That\u0027s assuming there were no controlled demolitions.) A full scale attack like some of the conspiracy theorists out there like to imagine would have involved hundreds of people and probably would have been almost impossible to keep a secret. But a couple of phone calls and a small 10 man team of demolitions experts could potentially accomplish what I\u0027m arguing. Why has no one come forwards? It could be fear that the government might kill them, it could be the fact that they\u0027re getting paid marvelously so they have more to lose by coming forwards or it could be a combination of the two. Not everyone is as righteous as Edward Snowden. A lot of people just look out for themselves.

I\u0027m willing to bet that the Snowden-esque surveillance has been going on for quite a while, but it took over 30 years for this information to be leaked and there are THOUSANDS of NSA employees. 9/11 only happened 14 years ago, and thousands of people would not have been needed to make this work.

Who is digging through people\u0027s personal files unconstitutionally or carrying out torture at Guantanamo? (Granted those aren\u0027t as significant as a large-scale attack on your own people.) There are hundreds of millions of people in this country, and while I\u0027d like to believe there is a vast majority that would be appalled at the idea of propagating something like 9/11, I\u0027m also sure there\u0027s a number of people willing to look the other way for the right price.\n\n\u0026gt; How were they able to wire 2 buildings with 110 floors each without anyone noticing? No fresh drywall or paint noticed. No security tapes. Nothing.\n\nI don\u0027t believe the Twin Towers were a controlled demolition. I believe two planes were hijacked and flown into the towers and the heat from the jet fuel fires weakened the steel supports enough so that they buckled, and then gravity did the rest. I am absolutely not a JET FUEL CAN\u0027T MELT STEEL BEAMS conspiracy theorist. (And fun fact, burning magnesium IS hot enough to melt steel, and magnesium is a very common component in airplane wings.) I believe that WTC-7 may have been a controlled demolition.

Seven hours amid complete chaos is enough time for an experienced team to plant charges and detonate them. \n\n\u0026gt;What was the plan if something went wrong, as happens from time to time in demolitions?

(I think it\u0027s a possibility that Al-Qaeda could have been contacted and instructed on where we were weak and how they could exploit those weaknesses, but I definitely believe that the hijackings happened as stated.

How much money would it take to keep EVERY SINGLE ONE of them quiet? Basically anyone involved would have enough proof to blow it wide open for, what would basically be the single biggest news story of all human history. Why hasn\u0027t that happened?\n\nHonestly, I don\u0027t think it would have to be that many. 50, maybe 100 at the very most. It could even be as low as 20. If it was a matter of the government instructing Al Qaeda on how to hijack a plane and where to fly that plane it may have only involved 2-3 people. (That\u0027s assuming there were no controlled demolitions.) A full scale attack like some of the conspiracy theorists out there like to imagine would have involved hundreds of people and probably would have been almost impossible to keep a secret. But a couple of phone calls and a small 10 man team of demolitions experts could potentially accomplish what I\u0027m arguing. Why has no one come forwards? It could be fear that the government might kill them, it could be the fact that they\u0027re getting paid marvelously so they have more to lose by coming forwards or it could be a combination of the two. Not everyone is as righteous as Edward Snowden. A lot of people just look out for themselves.

It would have been incredibly risky and an obvious way of tracking down people involved. However, it still happened. I am absolutely not discounting the possibility of pure coincidence, but you have to admit it is a BIG coincidence. Perhaps the fact that it is just so obvious is enough to pull it off.

I agree, it would be RIDICULOUSLY difficult to keep all of this under wraps, but that\u0027s not to say it\u0027s beyond the US Government\u0027s capabilities. Look at the NSA for example. It has been around since 1917, and has been conducting mass surveillance on US citizens since 1981. I\u0027m willing to bet that the Snowden-esque surveillance has been going on for quite a while, but it took over 30 years for this information to be leaked and there are THOUSANDS of NSA employees. 9/11 only happened 14 years ago, and thousands of people would not have been needed to make this work. Again, just spitballing.\n\n\u0026gt;Who did the work?  \n\nI don\u0027t know, and I\u0027m not going to pretend to. Who is digging through people\u0027s personal files unconstitutionally or carrying out torture at Guantanamo? (Granted those aren\u0027t as significant as a large-scale attack on your own people.) There are hundreds of millions of people in this country, and while I\u0027d like to believe there is a vast majority that would be appalled at the idea of propagating something like 9/11, I\u0027m also sure there\u0027s a number of people willing to look the other way for the right price.\n\n\u0026gt; How were they able to wire 2 buildings with 110 floors each without anyone noticing? No fresh drywall or paint noticed. No security tapes. Nothing.\n\nI don\u0027t believe the Twin Towers were a controlled demolition. I believe two planes were hijacked and flown into the towers and the heat from the jet fuel fires weakened the steel supports enough so that they buckled, and then gravity did the rest. I am absolutely not a JET FUEL CAN\u0027T MELT STEEL BEAMS conspiracy theorist. (And fun fact, burning magnesium IS hot enough to melt steel, and magnesium is a very common component in airplane wings.) I believe that WTC-7 may have been a controlled demolition. It came down seven hours after the Twin Towers and it started it\u0027s collapse from the bottom rather than the top. Seven hours amid complete chaos is enough time for an experienced team to plant charges and detonate them. \n\n\u0026gt;What was the plan if something went wrong, as happens from time to time in demolitions? What if the plane just clipped the building?\n\nAgain, I don\u0027t believe the Twin Towers fell as a result of a controlled demolition. I believe they fell because two planes flew into them. (I think it\u0027s a possibility that Al-Qaeda could have been contacted and instructed on where we were weak and how they could exploit those weaknesses, but I definitely believe that the hijackings happened as stated.

How much money would it take to keep EVERY SINGLE ONE of them quiet? Basically anyone involved would have enough proof to blow it wide open for, what would basically be the single biggest news story of all human history. Why hasn\u0027t that happened?\n\nHonestly, I don\u0027t think it would have to be that many. 50, maybe 100 at the very most. It could even be as low as 20. If it was a matter of the government instructing Al Qaeda on how to hijack a plane and where to fly that plane it may have only involved 2-3 people.

A full scale attack like some of the conspiracy theorists out there like to imagine would have involved hundreds of people and probably would have been almost impossible to keep a secret. But a couple of phone calls and a small 10 man team of demolitions experts could potentially accomplish what I\u0027m arguing. Why has no one come forwards? It could be fear that the government might kill them, it could be the fact that they\u0027re getting paid marvelously so they have more to lose by coming forwards or it could be a combination of the two.

You are correct in that the process of actually planting the explosives takes usually no more than a few days. I was thinking of the entire process of surveying the building and preparing it to fall, which usually takes a couple of months--there\u0027s a helpful article on [HowStuffWorks](http://science.howstuffworks.com/engineering/structural/building-implosion.htm) that describes how engineers will prepare a building to go down without harming nearby buildings, but that obviously would not be a priority in an evil government conspiracy bent on manipulation and ruin. \n\nSo if *all* you were concerned with was planting the charges--and you had obtained the plan of the building, figured out where to put the charges, what charges to use, how to get them in undetected, done all your prep work in advance--then the minimum, at least according to the example blasts on the website for Controlled Demolition, Inc., seems to be a few days.\n\n[500 Wood Street Building, 1997](http://www.controlled-demolition.com/500-wood-street-building)\n\n\"After two (2) months of preparation, CDI’s 13 person crew needed seven (7) days to place 1,590 linear shaped charges totaling 595 lb. of explosives on steel columns on 11 levels of the 27-story structure.\"\n\nHere\u0027s a rush job: [2000 Commonwealth Avenue](http://www.controlled-demolition.com/2000-commonwealth-avenue), where the building had caught on fire and was falling down anyway, and they had to scramble to get everything done in three days. \n\nThe [Beirut Hilton](http://www.controlled-demolition.com/beirut-hilton) mentions a six-week schedule and 880 lbs of explosives. \n\nThe [Biltmore Hotel](http://www.controlled-demolition.com/biltmore-hotel) doesn\u0027t give a timeline but mentions 991 separate charges. One suspects this would be difficult to do in seven hours. \n\nThe [JL Hudson Department Store](http://www.controlled-demolition.com/jl-hudson-department-store) took three months of study, which wouldn\u0027t be important here, but 24 days to place 4,118 charges in 1,100 spots. \n\nHere\u0027s another collapse, in [Saudi Arabia](http://www.controlled-demolition.com/sheikh-alakl-residential-commercial-center). I\u0027m not sure about this one, but it looks like it took 27 hours to plant the actual charges; this was another rush job of an already-collapsing building. \n\nBased on these examples, it appears that although you are correct that the actual planting of the explosives would not take months (assuming the necessary preparations, such as planning where to put the charges, had been made in advance), the process of putting the charges where they need to be put could not be accomplished in the amount of time stated by OP.

It would have been incredibly risky and an obvious way of tracking down people involved. However, it still happened. I am absolutely not discounting the possibility of pure coincidence, but you have to admit it is a BIG coincidence. Perhaps the fact that it is just so obvious is enough to pull it off.

I agree, it would be RIDICULOUSLY difficult to keep all of this under wraps, but that\u0027s not to say it\u0027s beyond the US Government\u0027s capabilities. Look at the NSA for example. It has been around since 1917, and has been conducting mass surveillance on US citizens since 1981. I\u0027m willing to bet that the Snowden-esque surveillance has been going on for quite a while, but it took over 30 years for this information to be leaked and there are THOUSANDS of NSA employees. 9/11 only happened 14 years ago, and thousands of people would not have been needed to make this work. Again, just spitballing.\n\n\u0026gt;Who did the work?  \n\nI don\u0027t know, and I\u0027m not going to pretend to. Who is digging through people\u0027s personal files unconstitutionally or carrying out torture at Guantanamo? (Granted those aren\u0027t as significant as a large-scale attack on your own people.) There are hundreds of millions of people in this country, and while I\u0027d like to believe there is a vast majority that would be appalled at the idea of propagating something like 9/11, I\u0027m also sure there\u0027s a number of people willing to look the other way for the right price.\n\n\u0026gt; How were they able to wire 2 buildings with 110 floors each without anyone noticing? No fresh drywall or paint noticed. No security tapes. Nothing.\n\nI don\u0027t believe the Twin Towers were a controlled demolition. I believe two planes were hijacked and flown into the towers and the heat from the jet fuel fires weakened the steel supports enough so that they buckled, and then gravity did the rest. I am absolutely not a JET FUEL CAN\u0027T MELT STEEL BEAMS conspiracy theorist. (And fun fact, burning magnesium IS hot enough to melt steel, and magnesium is a very common component in airplane wings.) I believe that WTC-7 may have been a controlled demolition. It came down seven hours after the Twin Towers and it started it\u0027s collapse from the bottom rather than the top. Seven hours amid complete chaos is enough time for an experienced team to plant charges and detonate them. \n\n\u0026gt;What was the plan if something went wrong, as happens from time to time in demolitions?

(I think it\u0027s a possibility that Al-Qaeda could have been contacted and instructed on where we were weak and how they could exploit those weaknesses, but I definitely believe that the hijackings happened as stated. That doesn\u0027t mean the government wasn\u0027t involved in my opinion. Also, if it happened in this way it would be MUCH easier to cover up, you would really only need one person making a call from a payphone.)\n\n\u0026gt; How many people would have been involved at each level?

If it was a matter of the government instructing Al Qaeda on how to hijack a plane and where to fly that plane it may have only involved 2-3 people. (That\u0027s assuming there were no controlled demolitions.) A full scale attack like some of the conspiracy theorists out there like to imagine would have involved hundreds of people and probably would have been almost impossible to keep a secret.

However, I\u0027m going to say the same thing to you that I said to someone else, but I\u0027m going to expand on it a bit. I absolutely don\u0027t believe that the WTCs were destroyed in any way besides planes being flown into them by radicals. I believe that there is a chance WTC7 was destroyed by a controlled demolition during the chaos following the collapse of the Twin Towers. The only conspiracy theory I\u0027m willing to entertain in regards to the Twin Towers is that someone from the US government potentially contacted Al Qaeda and explained to them that we had proverbial chinks in our armor (our airlines) and how they could be exploited. Why attack the WTC? At the time there were very few places as iconic as those towers. Nothing would get the country as riled up and bloodthirsty as attacking one of the most prominent places in the US\u0027s most iconic city. Can you justify a full-blown invasion off a mid-sized town being bombed? Maybe. But attempted bombings in the past had not had that effect. (Look at the 1993 WTC bombing. That was a big bomb in the same place that injured over 1000 people and it didn\u0027t spark a war.) It may have been a \"go big or go home\" type of thing. An attack that kills 3000 Americans and destroys a national landmark doesn\u0027t really have any response BUT war, where as a bombing of a stadium or a smaller city can be more easily ignored. The reason 9/11 was so impactful is because of the unnecessary casualties, the senselessness of it all. Thousands of random people, random AMERICANS, had been brutally murdered at a time when they should have been safe. Lots of people have been on a plane, it enhances the \"it could have been me\" fear factor AND anger factor. Also, the effects of 9/11 weren\u0027t just the increase in security, it completely altered the US\u0027s foreign policy.\n\nThanks a ton for your response!","duration":"","id":227,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw10e2","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":191,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"aidrocsid","label":"Let\u0027s assume, for a moment, that the US government decided it needed to have a publicly visible attack on US soil in order to justify a war on terror.

However, I\u0027m going to say the same thing to you that I said to someone else, but I\u0027m going to expand on it a bit. I absolutely don\u0027t believe that the WTCs were destroyed in any way besides planes being flown into them by radicals. I believe that there is a chance WTC7 was destroyed by a controlled demolition during the chaos following the collapse of the Twin Towers. The only conspiracy theory I\u0027m willing to entertain in regards to the Twin Towers is that someone from the US government potentially contacted Al Qaeda and explained to them that we had proverbial chinks in our armor (our airlines) and how they could be exploited. Why attack the WTC? At the time there were very few places as iconic as those towers. Nothing would get the country as riled up and bloodthirsty as attacking one of the most prominent places in the US\u0027s most iconic city. Can you justify a full-blown invasion off a mid-sized town being bombed? Maybe. But attempted bombings in the past had not had that effect. (Look at the 1993 WTC bombing. That was a big bomb in the same place that injured over 1000 people and it didn\u0027t spark a war.) It may have been a \"go big or go home\" type of thing. An attack that kills 3000 Americans and destroys a national landmark doesn\u0027t really have any response BUT war, where as a bombing of a stadium or a smaller city can be more easily ignored. The reason 9/11 was so impactful is because of the unnecessary casualties, the senselessness of it all. Thousands of random people, random AMERICANS, had been brutally murdered at a time when they should have been safe. Lots of people have been on a plane, it enhances the \"it could have been me\" fear factor AND anger factor. Also, the effects of 9/11 weren\u0027t just the increase in security, it completely altered the US\u0027s foreign policy.\n\nThanks a ton for your response!","duration":"","id":227,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw10e2","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":191,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"aidrocsid","label":"Let\u0027s assume, for a moment, that the US government decided it needed to have a publicly visible attack on US soil in order to justify a war on terror.

The put volume of AMR on September 10 was unusually high and actually exceeded the call volume by a ratio of 6:1—again, highly suspicious on its face. The SEC traced much of the surge in volume to a California investment advice newsletter, distributed by email and fax on Sunday, September 9, which advised its subscribers to purchase a particular type of AMR put options. The SEC interviewed 28 individuals who purchased these types of AMR puts on September 10, and found that 26 of them cited the newsletter as the reason for their transaction. Another 27 purchasers were listed as subscribers of the newsletter. The SEC interviewed the author of the newsletter, a U.S. citizen, who explained his investment strategy analysis, which had nothing to do with foreknowledge of 9/11. Other put option volume on September 10 was traced to similarly innocuous trades.\n\n\u0026gt;Another good example concerns a suspicious UAL put trade on September 7, 2001. A single trader bought more than one-third of the total puts purchased that day, establishing a position that proved very profitable after 9/11. Moreover, it turns out that the same trader had a short position in UAL calls—another strategy that would pay off if the price of UAL dropped. Investigation, however, identified the purchaser as a well-established New York hedge fund with $2 billion under management. Setting aside the unlikelihood of al Qaeda having a relationship with a major New York hedge fund, these trades looked facially suspicious. But further examination showed the fund also owned 29,000 shares of UAL stock at the time—all part of a complex, computer-driven trading strategy. As a result of these transactions, the fund actually lost $85,000 in value when the market reopened. Had the hedge fund wanted to profit from the attacks, it would not have retained the UAL shares.\n\n\u0026gt;The FBI investigated a trader who bought a substantial position in put options in AIG Insurance Co. shortly before 9/11. Viewed in isolation, the trade looked highly suspicious, especially when AIG stock plummeted after 9/11. The FBI found that the trade had been made by a fund manager to hedge a long position of 4.2 million shares in the AIG common stock. The fund manager owned a significant amount of AIG stock, but the fund had a very low tax basis in the stock (that is, it had been bought long ago and had appreciated significantly over time). Selling even some of it would have created a massive tax liability. Thus, the fund manager chose to hedge his position through a put option purchase. After 9/11, the fund profited substantially from its investment in puts. At the same time, however, it suffered a substantial loss on the common stock, and overall lost money as a result of the attacks.\n\nWhen you just look at the fact that there were way more put options, it sounds very suspicious.  So that\u0027s all \"truthers\" mention.  When you go a little deeper, and look at each of the individual companies and individuals who made those trades, as the SEC did, you see that there\u0027s a reasonable, completely non-conspiracy reason those trades happened.  A conspiracy theorist will tell you \"well the SEC was in on it\".  And in isolation, maybe that could be true.

The put volume of AMR on September 10 was unusually high and actually exceeded the call volume by a ratio of 6:1—again, highly suspicious on its face. The SEC traced much of the surge in volume to a California investment advice newsletter, distributed by email and fax on Sunday, September 9, which advised its subscribers to purchase a particular type of AMR put options. The SEC interviewed 28 individuals who purchased these types of AMR puts on September 10, and found that 26 of them cited the newsletter as the reason for their transaction. Another 27 purchasers were listed as subscribers of the newsletter. The SEC interviewed the author of the newsletter, a U.S. citizen, who explained his investment strategy analysis, which had nothing to do with foreknowledge of 9/11. Other put option volume on September 10 was traced to similarly innocuous trades.\n\n\u0026gt;Another good example concerns a suspicious UAL put trade on September 7, 2001. A single trader bought more than one-third of the total puts purchased that day, establishing a position that proved very profitable after 9/11. Moreover, it turns out that the same trader had a short position in UAL calls—another strategy that would pay off if the price of UAL dropped. Investigation, however, identified the purchaser as a well-established New York hedge fund with $2 billion under management. Setting aside the unlikelihood of al Qaeda having a relationship with a major New York hedge fund, these trades looked facially suspicious. But further examination showed the fund also owned 29,000 shares of UAL stock at the time—all part of a complex, computer-driven trading strategy. As a result of these transactions, the fund actually lost $85,000 in value when the market reopened. Had the hedge fund wanted to profit from the attacks, it would not have retained the UAL shares.\n\n\u0026gt;The FBI investigated a trader who bought a substantial position in put options in AIG Insurance Co. shortly before 9/11. Viewed in isolation, the trade looked highly suspicious, especially when AIG stock plummeted after 9/11. The FBI found that the trade had been made by a fund manager to hedge a long position of 4.2 million shares in the AIG common stock. The fund manager owned a significant amount of AIG stock, but the fund had a very low tax basis in the stock (that is, it had been bought long ago and had appreciated significantly over time). Selling even some of it would have created a massive tax liability. Thus, the fund manager chose to hedge his position through a put option purchase. After 9/11, the fund profited substantially from its investment in puts. At the same time, however, it suffered a substantial loss on the common stock, and overall lost money as a result of the attacks.\n\nWhen you just look at the fact that there were way more put options, it sounds very suspicious.  So that\u0027s all \"truthers\" mention.  When you go a little deeper, and look at each of the individual companies and individuals who made those trades, as the SEC did, you see that there\u0027s a reasonable, completely non-conspiracy reason those trades happened.

The fund manager owned a significant amount of AIG stock, but the fund had a very low tax basis in the stock (that is, it had been bought long ago and had appreciated significantly over time). Selling even some of it would have created a massive tax liability. Thus, the fund manager chose to hedge his position through a put option purchase.

Then, they would have to maintain total secrecy, and somehow navigate any and all unexpected obstacles/ chances for discovery that would have happened.  \n\nThe answer for why this is extremely unlikely is in our history: Richard Nixon.  A President of the United States was unable to cover up a conspiracy of much smaller, and easier proportions that didn\u0027t involve the murder of anyone.  Plus, they failed to anticipate the ease of which their break-in at the Watergate Hotel could have been discovered, which of course it was. \n\nIn re: the insider trading.  These sort of \"bets\" against companies happen with regularity.  The scale of 474k shares of stock in these two companies seems large, but in actuality it represented many different investors putting in put calls at the end of an uneventful summer travel season, when one would expect airline stock price to decline a bit. Investigation has consistently shown that the suspiciously high levels of put calls were \"innocuous.\" \n\nBuilding 7: this is where people get it all wrong.  [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003duFJa9WUy5QI) does a good job of explaining things.  But to be concise- all of those people are working scientifically \"backwards\", i.e. trying to fit a conclusion to their hypothesis rather than working from a null hypothesis.  It really is as simple as uncontrolled fires coming to extreme temperatures (since the sprinkler system was damaged) caused major percentile loss of strength in the steel structure of the building until the building collapsed under its own weight- straight down.  Why have we not seen this before?  Because this is literally the only time in history that a structure was allowed to burn at those temperatures without any sort of fire protection/fighting, since the building had been successfully evacuated and all emergency resources were tied up in saving human life.  What happened to Building 7 didn\u0027t matter when there were thousands of people with their lives at risk.  It burned to the ground in all senses of the phrase.\n\nThis actually comes down to a similar story as the ID/evolution debate:  the vast majority of scientists who have studied the evidence come to the same conclusion, and a very small minority remain skeptical due to personal reasons.  There\u0027s no more needed than that.\n\n","duration":"","id":307,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw06pn","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430602522E9,"simScore":0.727524098408046,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":308,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"nidarus","label":"I don\u0027t want to repeat what the others here said, but I\u0027ll just add this tip: **be suspicious of \"wall of text\" copypasta**. \n\nAt least on reddit, I\u0027ve rarely seen this technique used by people with legitimate arguments.

While the Iraq war was completely unrelated to the 9/11 attacks, in 2003 [almost 70% of Americans believed Saddam Hussein was personally involved in the 9/11 terror attacks.](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-09-06-poll-iraq_x.htm) I think the stock market is correlation, not causation.

I believe that it is possible that a small rogue section of the government got in touch with Al Qaeda and explained to them how the attacks could be carried out and how we were weak, or leaked it to them in some way. This would not require more than a few people. \n\n\u0026gt;I assume you aren\u0027t denying that the planes hit the buildings since you\u0027re discussing how the event affected airline stock - but just in case, how would a conspiracy theorist explain the thousands of independent videos from people in NY who saw the first plane hit and started filming?

In 1993 a bomb was set off underneath one of the WTCs and injured over 1000 people, it didn\u0027t cause anywhere near as much of a stir as 9/11. The buildings falling and killing 3000 people while simultaneously scarring the heart of arguably the most prominent city in the world jarred the nation in a way that makes war pretty much the ONLY response. Just killing a couple hundred in a plane crash doesn\u0027t necessarily accomplish that. With that said, the buildings didn\u0027t necessarily have to come down, that may have just been an unexpected side effect of having two planes smashed into the side of them. I\u0027m not asserting that WTCs 1+2 were a controlled demolition.\n\nThanks a lot for your response!","duration":"","id":337,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cqw2fz8","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":335,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"schneidmaster","label":"To be honest, I haven\u0027t and don\u0027t plan to watch any of the videos.

None of the inside job theories are compelling to me.  Internet detectives aren\u0027t reliable on this, much of the evidence is patently false or misinterpreted by people who have no real expertise.  There\u0027s a lot of conflicting evidence, and frankly the events themselves were so chaotic that if you look hard enough you can probably find signs of anything.  Instead of challenging your main premise, which I agree with, I\u0027ll present what I believe to be a much more plausible theory as to the US government\u0027s involvement.\n\n(*This is a copy of what I\u0027d posted in another thread a long time ago.*)\n\nThis theory does not involve the towers, the pentagon, or the planes at all.  9/11 was a conspiracy of inaction, elements within the Bush administration conspired to do nothing and \u0027inadvertently\u0027 allow the attacks to happen.\n\nConclusive evidence for this claim will be nearly impossible to find, unless the conspirators were so stupid as to leave communiques describing their willful negligence.  At best all we\u0027ll ever find is circumstantial evidence which is only enough to warrant further investigation.  In my mind there is more than enough evidence to seriously consider that elements within the Bush administration knowingly allowed the attacks of 9/11 to occur.\n\n**Motive**\n\nAt the core of my theory is the Project for the New American Century.  ([Official website](http://www.newamericancentury.org/) and [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century))  A neo-conservative think tank, their stated goals were effectively US global hegemony enforced at the barrel of a gun.  From the organization\u0027s very beginning, its members were actively agitating for \u0027regime change\u0027 in Iraq.\n\nThe process for \"Creating Tomorrow\u0027s Dominant Force...is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event––like a new Pearl Harbor\"  ([Source](http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf))  It is already abundantly clear that 9/11 was capitalized on and horrifically abused to further ideological goals, which is abominable enough, yet there are many private interests which would benefit from an increasingly militarized and aggressive United States.  Oil companies (like [Halliburton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halliburton), Dick Cheney became CEO there in 1995) profited enormously from uncontested access to Iraqi oil and \u0027defense\u0027 industry companies (like KBR, which has ties to Cheney as well) were awarded untold billions of dollars to supply and support the US invasion and subsequent occupation.\n\n(For fun reading, take a look at the [Zapata Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapata_Corporation) and [Dresser Industries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresser_Industries), be sure to pay attention how many times the name Bush pops up.)\n\n**Opportunity**\n\nA quick look at the [people involved with the PNAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century#Persons_associated_with_the_PNAC) shows a who\u0027s who of American Neo-Conservativism.  Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, and Scooter Libby make the list.  Let\u0027s not forget Dan Quayle either, who was George HW Bush\u0027s vice president.  These names should sound familiar, they all held high positions within George W Bush administration.  These people were core members of an organization that wanted the US to invade Iraq and now they had the power to do so.  All they needed was an excuse.\n\n*But there was no need to organize a false flag attack.*  They could just wait until a real attack occurred and then manipulate a panicked public.  It was only a matter of time, al-Qaeda has been [trying to attack the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_al-Qaeda_attacks) for years, including a 1993 attempt to destroy the World Trade Center.  And then comes the infamous presidential brief given to Bush on August 6th, 2001, titled [\"Bin Laden Determined to Strike in US.\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_Ladin_Determined_To_Strike_in_US)\n\nThe US government was well aware of the threat from al-Qaeda and even had good reason to believe they would target the WTC.  (Take a look at the PDB itself.)  But then things like this happened:\n\n\u0026gt;Finally, one week after Bush received the August 6 PDB, immigration authorities in Minneapolis, Minnesota arrested Zaccarias Moussaoui, an Islamic fundamentalist extremist who had sought training in flying a Boeing 747 at a Minneapolis-area flight school. The US government has since charged Moussaoui with being a co-conspirator in the September 11 attacks.\n\n\u0026gt;At the time of Moussaoui’s detention, FBI officials in Minneapolis sent a series of urgent requests to FBI headquarters in Washington for authorization to pursue an investigation into the man’s suspected links to Al Qaeda. The agents explicitly cited fears that Moussaoui was training to fly commercial jets in order to pilot one into a skyscraper, and named the World Trade Center as a likely target. Top FBI officials denied their requests and refused to authorize a search of Moussaoui’s computer hard drive.\n\nhttps://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2004/04/pdb-a12.html\n\nAfter 9/11, the Bush administration hindered investigative efforts and [explicitly requested that they stop.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dePOIhhd9Jr0)  This could have merely been an attempt to save face after an enormous failure, yet in the context of everything else I\u0027ve mentioned it could mean something very different.\n\nThere is nothing conclusive or condemning here but, in my mind at least, this paints a very plausible narrative.  At the very least, the people at the top should have been thoroughly investigated.  When you have motive, opportunity, and suspects, the right course of action should be inescapably obvious.\n\nMost of the 9/11 conspiracy crowd are way over complicating things.  I think they\u0027ve got the basic idea right, that there was at least complicity in the US government, but they\u0027re getting caught up in knots over the little details.  The possibility I\u0027ve presented above is only that, a possibility, but I believe that it is far more plausible than any other 9/11 theory I\u0027ve encountered.  There were just too many coincidences that benefited a small and specific group of people.","duration":"","id":342,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqwi07n","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.43064051E9,"simScore":0.735873297242535,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":343,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"vittgenstein","label":"If the government can\u0027t cover up Bill Clinton\u0027s blowjobs, how are they going to coverup a multimillion/billion dollar undertaking spanning multiple departments, agencies, and branches of government to take down three buildings?\n\n","duration":"","id":343,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw9afw","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430621893E9,"simScore":0.7294243453320487,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":344,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"totesmessenger","label":"This thread has been linked to from another place on reddit.\n\n- [/r/conspiracy] [Government Shrills propagate false 9/11 narrative on reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/34o8ry/government_shrills_propagate_false_911_narrative/)\n\n- [/r/conspiracy] [Reddit has been infiltrated by government shills.](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/34o7u4/reddit_has_been_infiltrated_by_government_shills/)\n\n[](#footer)*^(If you follow any of the above links, respect the rules of reddit and don\u0027t vote.) ^\\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger/wiki/) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose/?to\u003d\\/r\\/TotesMessenger))*\n\n[](#bot)","duration":"","id":344,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqwhrqj","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.430639957E9,"simScore":0.7923778042679703,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":345,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"fujum8","label":"First off i want to say that im not an engineer or any of that stuff.

We have sulfuric acid that can be created through the introduction of sulfur dioxide and oxygen, and the subsequent reactions from there. The presence of sulfuric acid strongly suggests that water, either as a liquid or gas, was present in the debris piles. We know that increased temperatures will intensify the oxidation process, and we also know that since sulfur dioxide is a reducing agent it has the ability to reverse the oxidation process and then allow the creation of hydrogen during the re-oxidation phase. We know that hydrogen will burn at the temperatures recorded, and since a reducing agent is present hydrogen can be continuously replaced until either there is no more iron, no more water, or no more sulfur dioxide created from organicly fueled fires. It\u0027s a potentially high temperature reaction that can sustain itself for some time, and for more than enough time to melt steel.\n\nThis is sort of an oversimplification of the process though, it\u0027s not very efficient and is useless for hydrogen production if temperatures are too high. The hydrogen just burns off.\n\nThe most important part that I admittedly left out before is the presence of a reducing agent. Without one that reaction isn\u0027t possible.

The presence of sulfuric acid strongly suggests that water, either as a liquid or gas, was present in the debris piles. We know that increased temperatures will intensify the oxidation process, and we also know that since sulfur dioxide is a reducing agent it has the ability to reverse the oxidation process and then allow the creation of hydrogen during the re-oxidation phase. We know that hydrogen will burn at the temperatures recorded, and since a reducing agent is present hydrogen can be continuously replaced until either there is no more iron, no more water, or no more sulfur dioxide created from organicly fueled fires. It\u0027s a potentially high temperature reaction that can sustain itself for some time, and for more than enough time to melt steel.\n\nThis is sort of an oversimplification of the process though, it\u0027s not very efficient and is useless for hydrogen production if temperatures are too high.

SecDef Rumsfeld made the notification to congress just days before 9/11. Notionally a great idea - if you know somethings \"about\" to go down and need people to forget about it, drop your news just before things go south.\n\n- In the way of conspiracies - one need look no further than rather treasonous actions of staffers such as [Douglas Feith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_J._Feith) related persons who\u0027s actions more less sold the idea of the Iraq War up the food chain - on [faked intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger_uranium_forgeries#Second_and_third_dissemination) - if you want to find a valid and serious conspiracy - look no further than the **[Office of Special Plans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Special_Plans)**.

So while various persons involved , [Michael Leeden comes to mind here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ledeen#Yellowcake_forgery_allegations) still takes opportunities to protest his innocence (in mostly the same way OJ Simpson probably still looks for the \"real\" killers of his wife), it really doesn\u0027t matter now that the war is over, and Iraq is a permanent mess for the foreseeable future.\n\nOf course sadly there are the conspiracies which have become known\n\n- what was once conspiracy has become common knowledge - the vast and sprawling surveillance state is a feature none of us doubt any longer - so what was once tin-hat conspiracy rantings about recording everything and monitoring everything (this message included), is - matter of factly - taken for granted - a state which was not always so.\n\n\n","duration":"","id":383,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_cqw9tg8","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: I\u0027m starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.","label":"emergencytaco","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_34m77r","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.430597816E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.43062294E9,"simScore":0.7803508889892147,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},{"index":384,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"generalmills13","label":"You aren\u0027t wrong.

refrain from making anymore comments about controlled demolitions, my view has been thoroughly changed on that matter. I accept it as basically an impossibility. \n\nI\u0027m going to start off by saying that I\u0027m not by any means a full-blown conspiratard, but the potential of 9/11 being propagated by the US Gov\u0027t is an idea that has always interested me. I\u0027ve read most of the other 9/11 threads on this sub and they\u0027ve all fostered fantastic discussions. I was hoping to have a discussion on some points I saw made in another thread. The rest of this post is going to be a comment I saw made in another thread which calls to light some inconsistencies in the official story behind the 9/11 attacks. Despite the research I\u0027ve done on the subject, I\u0027m not yet educated enough to be able to dispute many of these. I\u0027m hoping that some of you can assist me with that, because the more I think about it the more I think that this whole thing being a false flag is a possibility.\n\nBefore I get into the full comment that I mentioned, the first and foremost thing I would like to have someone debunk is the [Insider Trading](http://en.wikipedia.org/?title\u003d9/11_conspiracy_theories#Suspected_insider_trading) conspiracy theory, as that is one of the most compelling ones for me. What could be a reason for the MASSIVE disparity between \"put\" and \"call\u0027 options, and why did it only involve the two airlines whose planes were hijacked?\n\nWith that asked, here is the full comment from the other thread.\n\nI have questions about that day and many others do as well — *Did you know?* — Senator Max Cleland Resigned from the 9/11 Commission.

I\u0026amp;#39;ve read most of the other 9/11 threads on this sub and they\u0026amp;#39;ve all fostered fantastic discussions. I was hoping to have a discussion on some points I saw made in another thread. The rest of this post is going to be a comment I saw made in another thread which calls to light some inconsistencies in the official story behind the 9/11 attacks. Despite the research I\u0026amp;#39;ve done on the subject, I\u0026amp;#39;m not yet educated enough to be able to dispute many of these.
