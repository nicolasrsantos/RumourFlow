An FPTP system is mathematically proven to inevitably lead to a two-party system. Also, the specific delegate system of the US (primaries and caucuses voting) is also susceptible to gerrymandering in the extreme. And it goes on and on: The Electoral College, of which members aren\u0027t even required to vote the way the state\u0027s population did; the first three starting votes each state has (supposedly to make states with low populations have more deciding power), together with the population-specific amounts of votes, skewing the presidential voting results by actually making it possible to have a little over 20% of the whole population\u0027s votes, yet have over 50% of votes necessary to become president.\n\nAnd I could go on even further, but it should really be apparent: The whole US voting system is flawed beyond belief. Using it, it\u0027s mathematically impossible to have a fair, democratic outcome. Instead of solely placing the blame on the citizens\u0027 voting, people should accept the reality of how the population will vote and try to fix the system\u0027s inherent flaws--which, by the way, also lead to political apathy because of the realization that nothing will ever change.\n\nAlso: Just look at the UK failing to implement the Alternative Vote system on May 5 last year. Thanks to a stupid amount of pundits rallying against it, they actually managed to convince a majority of the population to accept a mathematically inferior way of voting for all eternity. Don\u0027t make the same mistake, people of the US.","duration":"","id":162,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_c3kgx3l","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":160,"links":[159],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Logic_Voice","label":"Frankly, it\u0027s really the fault of the voter masses.\n\nYou can\u0027t simply \"trust\" people in power, that\u0027s just foolish to the extreme.

I share your deep concern about this troubling issue.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt; As you know, on November 13th the CBS program \"60 Minutes\" aired a segment calling attention to this topic. The report was most disturbing.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt; H.R. 1148, the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, was introduced earlier this year. It prohibits Members of Congress and their staff from profiting from non-public information they learn as part of their official positions. This is a common-sense bill and I\u0027m proud to be a cosponsor of it. Should this or relevant legislation come before me on the Floor of the House, I will certainly vote for it. \n\n[Here is a link to the bill on govtrack](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill\u003dh112-1148).

We are the people who can make our voices heard. True democracy means having someone listening to our opinions and our concerns and then acting upon them. That\u0027s how the U.S. was always intended to be - to be a representative democracy.\n\nRight now, money is the equivalent of a voice. Special interests, lobbyists, large corporations with agendas get laws written and passed in Washington. Let\u0027s change this - let\u0027s call, email, text, write, and meet with our local representatives about EVERYTHING. Not just SOPA, not just PIPA, but about the fact that there are a lot of people who want to see our economy flourish again, and there are a lot of people who want to see true change in the U.S.\n\nThe political process, as it is right now, doesn\u0027t work. We need to really find a better system of taking proposals from the people, and having our representatives vote on them.\n\nPresident Obama said that he\u0027d sign a bill tomorrow banning insider trading for members of congress - *how many people think that such a bill could actually be on his desk by tomorrow?* If you think it can\u0027t be done - *why not?*\n\nThe system needs to change. We need to make our bills not so weighed down by so many amendments and additions. I think it\u0027s safe to say that American\u0027s agree with banning insider trading for politicians, let\u0027s get that on a bill and pass it. Let\u0027s not stand for a bill that gets drafted - and then on the back of that bill, have 40 other things tacked on, making it hard for members of congress to vote for it. Let\u0027s insist on passing laws with one central focus at a time.\n\nWe need to fix our system. We\u0027re the generation that can do it.

It is a 3D space in which there are many topics and issues which public interest is focused around. Each user leaves an imprint on the subject in the form of a particle orbiting around the issue/topic that has two properties, colour and speed. The Colour represents the users feeling about the issue and the speed represents how strongly the user feels about it.\nThese issues are not things like abortion or war as a whole. They are all individual cases that are simple and immediate enough for people to inform themselves about. Such as Bradley Manning\u0027s arrest or FEMA\u0027s reaction post Katrina.\n\nIf you zoom out of the topic, the overal feeling of the issue becomes clearer, the colour and speed will average out and you can get an idea of the consensus as a whole.\n\nZoom out even more and the issues are grouped into topics of, say, food, government, poverty, etc. Then, further out it might get more philosophical.\n\nAny user that has anything to comment on the issue attaches a comment to their imprint and people can view them. For example, if there was one topic that everyone seemed fine with but one person left a red fast imprint on the issue, he would be able to explain his stance.\n\nSo reddit. I\u0027ve thought about this for a long, long while. Granted, it\u0027s just a way of looking at how the populace feels, but combined with a tighter, responsable, responsive government, I think this could really work.","duration":"","id":655,"color":"yellow","redditID":"t1_c3kgydi","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":654,"links":[653],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"yellowbugs","label":"Right, which is why I think it\u0027d necessitate a wholly-separate site.

We are the people who can make our voices heard. True democracy means having someone listening to our opinions and our concerns and then acting upon them. That\u0027s how the U.S. was always intended to be - to be a representative democracy.\n\nRight now, money is the equivalent of a voice.

Not just SOPA, not just PIPA, but about the fact that there are a lot of people who want to see our economy flourish again, and there are a lot of people who want to see true change in the U.S.\n\nThe political process, as it is right now, doesn\u0027t work.
