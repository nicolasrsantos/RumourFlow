You know it would be mind bendingly awesome if it turned out Al Qaeda sent operatives into the world trade center and rigged demo charges to blow.

It would mean that 9/11 wasn't an inside job but all the stuff the debunkers have said about it being 'scientific' was false.

No one would win the argument.

&gt;“moderately severe character defect manifested by well-documented ideation with a paranoid flavor and a grandiose character.” 

That does sum up *most* of reddits various subcultures, particularly the paultard culture..
but it wouldn't be an *inside* job, the whole slogan would end up empty.
*sigh* Your lack of comprehension astounds me.

But I suppose this being reddit you're probably either a truther or a paultard or btoh so it figures...

edit: please don't take me seriously, I'm just tired and will probably regret this in the morning.
When they say 'inside job' they mean the US government was somehow involved, however if it was because Al-Qaeda had operatives planted inside the US government it would be a totally different ballgame.

Sure I'm arguing semantics, but when you hear 'inside job' it doesn't mean people from inside but the government itself.
I'm pretty sure ithas been infilitrated by anon...
It shouldn't matter if he's a Muslim or not. People should be judged by their actions not by their skin colour or creed. It's sad such 'misinformations' can actually damage political careers.
If they are truly devout to their religion they will act differently to if they aren't. NOw if they pretend to be someone they aren't just to get elected then turn 180 once in office, theres a problem which should be resolved by impeachment or something to that effect.
23% ass hats who have never met a Muslim.
