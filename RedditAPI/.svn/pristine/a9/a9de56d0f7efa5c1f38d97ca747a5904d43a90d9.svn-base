To be fair, according to the [internet](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=ron+paul+new+hampshire+polls), he's in second.  My TV doesn't exist, so I can't speak to that.

Edited for typo.
So if you get in a car accident, we should be less sympathetic and concerned because other people have been in car accidents?
I'm not claiming a vast anti-Paul conspiracy.  However, consistently being left out of nationally televised/published mainstream polling results where they include 4-6 candidates, and the candidate at second place who has about twice the results of 3rd and 4th combined is left out, is definitely something that should be addressed.

Edited for clarity
What other candidate, who is polling in the top 5 or so, is consistently left out of such polling results and related discussions?

There's always going to be media bias, but this goes beyond bias.
You think [this (now with comic relief!)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb5aGgQXhXo) is an acceptable amount of bias?
