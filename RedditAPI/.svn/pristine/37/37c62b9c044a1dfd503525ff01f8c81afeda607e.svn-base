The only point of \"HIV\" here is as a delivery system.  The \"payload\" is the genes that encode the proteins that reprogram the T-cells to kill all B-cells.  If you could come up with a payload that would kill HIV, then yes, you could use a lentivirus to get it into cells.  There are certainly a lot of good candidate genes for this kind of payload, but I don\u0027t know that they would really be more effective and safe then current therapy.\n\nHowever, I can think of several more exotic methods that qualify as \"using HIV to kill itself\", but they aren\u0027t quite this, require a lot different background info and context, and aren\u0027t really ready for prime time in patients.
