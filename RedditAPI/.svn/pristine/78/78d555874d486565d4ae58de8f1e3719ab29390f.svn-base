Speculators actually stabilize prices and allocate capital to where it's needed. If they didn't provide a necessary service to the market, then how on Earth could they come to exist?
Middlemen raise prices, yeah, in exchange for services. The service, in this case, is price stability.

Speculators buy low and sell high (they have to, to make money).

So, when oil is cheap, they buy it and stockpile it. Later, when prices go up, they sell the oil. This increases the supply and prices are kept more stable. Sure, some hoard oil even more, speculating on prices going up even more, but eventually they do sell their oil before prices go down.

What do you think about calling the President by his middle name?

I knew one guy on a forum who called President Obama "Hussein-O", which was kind of funny, because it's just so disrespectful and mocking.

Right, but even though you say that you're disturbed by the President assassinating people, at the end of the day, if you still vote for the man, that's a much more meaningful testament to your values.

I think this is a very weak excuse. I don't expect any politician to agree with my personal views 100% (though last time I checked, Ron Paul agrees with me 95% of the time and Gary Johnson's up to 97%), but there are issues I'm not willing to compromise my conscience on.

One of those issues is foreign policy. Another is civil liberties.

Although I don't agree with most of what makes President Obama popular with left-wingers, I can understand the appeal of universal health care and things like that. The fact remains, though, when you vote for him, you're basically saying that health care for you and other Americans is more important than not sending soldiers off to die pointlessly, is more important than not meddling with other nations' affairs, and is more important than dead kids and civilians in Pakistan.

If those are your priorities, that's fine--I just wish my friends on the left would be more honest about it.
If enough Americans took their consciences with regards to civil liberties and foreign policy into account, the two major parties would *have* to change their stances or else face the possibility of being usurped by a third party.

Personally, I would not hesitate to vote for, say, Denis Kucinich, despite that he's a hardcore social-democrat, because I feel that I can trust the protection of civil liberties to him.
I agree. Policy matters more than rhetoric.

Sure, Obama may have been to 57 states, but this doesn't matter to me when we're on the razor's edge of war with Iran and "intervention" in Syria.
That's not true. The US is probably a very large producer of arms, but arms that end up in criminal or warlord hands? I'd have to ask for some proof of that.
I don't know, man. I'm a right-winger in some ways, but I honestly do think the US is starting to become a police states. Take a fucking look at how heavily armed police are and the kinds of things they get away with on a regular basis.

And we're not just talking about violations of civil rights--cops get away with what would be called murder if it was done by anyone else.
Well, we're not North Korea, that's for sure, but I hope you'd agree that there are things currently happening in the US that just aren't acceptable.
