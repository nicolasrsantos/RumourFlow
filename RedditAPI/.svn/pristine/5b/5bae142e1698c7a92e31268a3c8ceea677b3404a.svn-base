Went to a gun show and came back with these two)\n\n4 - Taurus PT709\n\n(got my CHL and needed a carry gun. I was trolling around for a PF-9 or a LC-9 when a LGS went out of business and cleared out their inventory - this was one of those guns)\n\n5 - Springfield XD(M) 3.8 9mm\n\n(I thought I had a problem with the Taurus (turned out to be me) and thought I should have a back-up gun suitable for carry. A friend of mine has the same gun and I enjoyed shooting it. Big promo was running with a decent price and a bunch of freebie mags so I pulled the trigger on it)\n\n6 - Ruger SR22\n\n(a guy at my club had one for sale, barely used - I was looking for something easier for my kids to handle, plus it\u0027s a fun plinker)\n\n7 - Ruger 10/22\n\n(realization that I need to work on my basics more, plus for kids to shoot, in lieu of a Cricket)\n\nSo, I guess I fucked this all up :-(\n\nI have gone to and fro on the XDM. Me, I love the feel of it and enjoy shooting it. I bought it in the kit during the magazine promo and am now swimming in magazines for it. I\u0027ve been trolling for a full size XDM but decided to get the SR22 and 10/22 and work on some basics. I\u0027m toying with the idea of trading with someone XD(M) for Glock 19. There seems to be a much larger eco-system of stuff for the Glock.","duration":"","id":239,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c6kbjbv","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"THIS IS A LIST OF THE GUNS YOU SHOULD GET.

It doesn\u0027t have a proven track record with any reputable military or LE group.  It\u0027s used by a *very* few police departments (the number that use it in the U.S. can be counted on one hand) and the Croatian military and something you have to take into account there is that it\u0027s manufactured in Croatia and was originally invented in Croatia, and when it comes to weapons militaries the world over are typically *very* heavily pressured to buy domestic, so the fact that the XD is made in Croatia probably had a *lot* to do with why the Croatian military chose it as their standard issue sidearm.\n\n-Glock, on the other hand...well, do I even need to start listing all the major military and LE agencies and units that use it? NYPD, DEA, FBI, U.S. Army Delta Force, NY State Police, French Special Forces, GSG-9 (German Federal Police special operations), IDF, Russian MVD Special Forces, CO-19 of the London Met, and many more.  [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glock#Users) is a more comprehensive list if you\u0027re curious.\n\n-I really don\u0027t like the grip safety on the XD--why? Because it\u0027s an extra moving part that doesn\u0027t need to be there, it\u0027s just one more thing that can break and jam up the gun.  There\u0027s also the off chance that you won\u0027t fully depress it in an emergency and therefore won\u0027t be able to fire the weapon and therefore you\u0027ll die.\n\n-I also think the G19 is *the* perfect size for CCW, and there isn\u0027t a corresponding XD model to match it (one with at least a 3.8\" barrel so you don\u0027t lose too much velocity and a height such that it\u0027s *just* big enough for you to get a full grip on the pistol but no taller).  5 inches tall is *perfect*.  Height makes more of a difference with regards to concealability than *any other measurement*, so you don\u0027t want the gun to be any taller than it absolutely has to be, but you (I, at least) want to be able to get a full grip on it--the G19 is the shortest, most compact, pistol out there that you can get a full and proper grip on and which has a 4\" barrel.  It really is the perfect size.\n\n-Glock has more aftermarket support and accessories, but of course the XD has plenty as well.  Not that big a deal.\n\nI just really don\u0027t like the XD because nobody reputable wants to use it, and that plus the fact that it\u0027s been around *plenty* long enough (over a decade now) to have been adopted by a ton of agencies and military units, speaks volumes as far as I\u0027m concerned.","duration":"","id":322,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_c6kko95","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":321,"links":[316],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"pryoslice","label":"Please help a noob understand why a Glock 19 is worth the extra money over an XD-9 for home and carry.","duration":"","id":321,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_c6kk088","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":316,"links":[310],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"ohstrangeone","label":"A large part of the reason for his suggestion of a Glock 19 is because a lot of people will be Americans looking for a carry gun.

I was goign to go Sig 226 .22 for range and plinking, or a wussier cheaper Baretta Neos LR (again same purpose plink + indoor range)  Are you stating that this Glock 19 is your choice for handguns because it\u0027s multipurpose range and defence? Or could a wussier gun be applied for range only (Sine you DO touch home defence later in your list)\n\nCurious, noob, Canadian and honestly curious as to what a good starter pistol would be (And I\u0027m not looking to do open or closed carry)\n\nAs for the 10/22 tech sights. My lord that\u0027s a nice simple thing that looks accurate as hell out of the box for a beginner (I\u0027m a little more advanced with riflemanship as those are easily purchasable here in Canada and I was thinking a Savage Mk II BTVS (Accutrigger) and optics? Eh, I\u0027m looking to shoot maybe 50 yd - 200 yd (depending on outdoor ranges) so optics I don\u0027t know anythign about, I\u0027ll have to sit down and learn. But man, that 10/22 is gorgeous.\n\nThe Spike\u0027s Tactical, Gorgeous. \u0027nuff said.\n\nMossberg 590 I\u0027ve also heard of and also gorgeous. your list is no nonsense, but I only ask about the pistol, becuse it seems you\u0027re doing dual purpose and wonder if you could suggest \u0027range/plink only\u0027 option.\n\nThanks in advance! Super noobie form the North!","duration":"","id":310,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c6k9qbs","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"THIS IS A LIST OF THE GUNS YOU SHOULD GET.

The 10/22 is a fine rifle, so is a henry lever action, so is a marlin bolt action.  Go to a gun store and have them show you a few models, and if something feels natural on your shoulder it\u0027s probably fine.\n\nStarter pistols:\nYou have a few options of caliber here.  \nIf you have the time, start with .22lr and buy: 1) a ruger mark 3, or 2) a browning buckmark, or 3) a beretta U22 neos.  You may see a walther p22 or sig mosquito and think they look cool, but they don\u0027t operate as reliably as the 3 above...especially with cheap ammo.\n\nIf you\u0027re concerned about home defense and money is an issue, start with a 9mm pistol.  Don\u0027t get a small one, buy full size and if you later feel like carrying then invest in a compact.  There are many fine brands to choose from, Smith and Wesson M\u0026amp;P models are great, Springfield xD, Glock 19, CZ-75, and Beretta 92 are good places to start.\n\nFor a shotgun there\u0027s a long argument among owners of the Remington 870 and the Mossberg 500/590 as to which is better.  Both are great, and you probably won\u0027t be able to tell any difference in reliability without doing a several thousand round torture test.  They have different placements for the safety, and both come in multiple barrel lengths.

If you have to adjust your grip to reach the safety or other controls, or cannot quickly and instinctively acquire a decent sight picture then the gun doesn\u0027t fit you well, and you should seek another.  It was demonstrated to me that this could be easily tested by \"drawing\" the gun with your eyes closed and naturally pointing it (in a safe direction of course), and opening your eyes to see where the gun\u0027s sights sit in relation to your eyes.  Personally, I\u0027ve found Glocks to be pointing at the sky, and Sigs to be a bit tall for me personally.\n\nOf course this could be overcome with training, but in my opinion, it makes more sense to have your first gun be one that instills good habits that apply to most firearms instead just one brand.\n\nI made my previous comment assuming that other people shopped for a well fitting handgun in the same way that I do.
