The actor that played him was a professional boxer in real life. However, shortly after the movie he tested  positive for AIDS. This was like in the mid 90s. Then, in ~200*, following several arrests for petty crimes and drug addiction, he tried to make a comeback. He claimed that his test results had been faked in an obvious plot by his enemies. Furthermore he  doesn\u0027t have AIDS. Furthermore. AIDS doesn\u0027t even exist. (Furthermore he later claimed to have the power to teleport, and to have healed a bullet wound with his mind). He went on to fight a few more fights, but only in states that didn\u0027t require AIDS testing, and backing out  of fights when they would insist last minute  he submit blood. He\u0027s re-retired, but there was a semi-recent interview with him (and his new girlfriend with whom he has unprotected sex) where he goes on some more about how AIDS doesn\u0027t exist and expounds on his powers, and how he has sex with his new GF without  protection because isn\u0027t really transmitted that way any way and also doesn\u0027t exit. The interviewer reported that he was covered in `whatever the name is of that sore that AIDS patients get as a result of some cancer`.\n\nSo yeah, after reading through all of this, I went down a very dark road reading about AIDS, and  the initial outbreaks, and  the  suspected patient zeros, and finally even more about denialism.
