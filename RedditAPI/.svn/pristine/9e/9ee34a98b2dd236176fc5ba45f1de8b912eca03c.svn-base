Iraqi officials prevent the inspectors from leaving the site for four days.\n\n* March 19, 1992 - Iraq declares that it once possessed 89 missiles and chemical weapons, but destroyed them in the summer of 1991. This unilateral destruction of weapons is a violation of SCR 687.\n\n* July 1992 - UNSCOM destroys some Iraqi chemical weapons and production facilities.\n\n* June 1994 - UNSCOM destroys material and equipment relating to chemical weapons production.\n\n* July 1, 1995 - Iraq admits the existence of its biological weapons program.\n\n* May 1996 - Al-Hakam, a facility used for the production of biological weapons agents, is destroyed.\n\n* September 25, 1997 - During an inspection of a food laboratory, inspectors seize suspicious documents concerning bacteria and chemicals.

Blaming Nader for the election of Bush distracts us from the real and extremely serious issues present in that election, namely that it was easy to see the systematic disenfranchisement of certain voters. These are issues that have gone largely unaddressed, and similar practices have spread to other states. \n\nI\u0027m as frustrated as any person that Bush won. I just think it\u0027s more productive to talk about the actual reason he won, rather than painting third party candidates like Nader as the spoiler.","duration":"","id":184,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_cegcqk1","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":169,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"joelman0","label":"Hmmm ... and if I hadn\u0027t voted for you in 2000, Ralph, I\u0027d have voted for Gore, and we never would\u0027ve invaded Iraq in the first place.

There is no other way to classify the vote-- it can *only* increase the chances of creating a more conservative government. It might make you feel good in a masturbatory sense but if your *stated* political goal is to make the government more green/liberal/progressive then you\u0027ll have failed to act in accordance with that goal.\n\nIf you aren\u0027t in a state anywhere near the tipping point, however, you can and should vote for the third party candidate that you are most closely aligned to (assuming there is one). There are very real, very positive effects for those candidates to get higher vote totals as long as they aren\u0027t acting as a spoiler. \n\nAs usual, there\u0027s no single right way to act here, but the circumstances and context matter quite a bit.
