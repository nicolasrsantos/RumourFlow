Republicans, clearly.  
&gt; probably Muslim,

Based on WHAT, for fuck's sake??   Being black does not equal Muslim.   I don't disagree with your larger points, but why the hell is this even in the mix?   
It matters if the default assumption absent ALL evidence is that he's "probably muslim."  Again... based on WHAT?   
Because he identifies as a Christian and attends a christian church for 20+ years.  My Dad was Christian.  Does that mean that I'm Christian even if I say I'm something else?  
Example UTTERLY applies since he would have had to have been lying since he was a little kid.  What, for the time he was planning on running for President some day?   

I would suggest that your position that he's "probably a Muslim" is ill conceived, plays right into the right wing talking point, assumes that the President is a giant fucking liar hiding a huge deal for over 20 years on the off chance that he might be able to run for President some day, and is depressingly stuck in minutiae.  

If, as you say, it DOES NOT MATTER, then why suggest he's "probably Muslim?"   Because you're depressingly stuck in minutiae.
