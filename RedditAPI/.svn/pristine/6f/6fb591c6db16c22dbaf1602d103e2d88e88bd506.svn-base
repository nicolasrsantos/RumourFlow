If you are already fully committed to the notion that Bush lied, that no one had ever thought of this, that Clinton did not actually defend Bush on this one issue, and that the U.S. had been at war with Iraq for over a decade by 2003, then I guess nothing will convince you. None of that relieves Bush of the responsibility of his decision, or of the incompetent way he conducted the post-war reconstruction, but the point of research is to clarify, not to obscure, and to note patterns of state behavior even when you wish they were just all reducible to personalities. But maybe others will benefit from reading it.","duration":"","id":14,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_ciy6bzh","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"Was Clinton the first to link WMDs and Al-Queda to Iraq?","label":"politicalmpa","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_28rodo","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.403434844E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.405474082E9,"simScore":0.7599141235838225,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":15,"links":[14],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"politicalmpa","label":"I never said Bush lied, I made that clear.

It relies on off handed quotes to say that Clinton linked Iraq to Al-Queda. I really do not believe it provides evidence for the claims laid out here. The Bill Richardson quote is really not enough evidence for me. I can not find the transcript, but it appears to be taken out of context. From what I can gather Richardson is indirectly linking Iraq to Al-Queda through Sudan. If a President wanted to link Al-Queda to Iraq it would make more sense to just go out themselves and say it directly in a prime time speech. Here its the ambassador to the UN making a somewhat longer than necessary comment on CNN. \n\nIn the blog it also seems 1998 Iraq is being compared to 2003 Iraq. I feel the missile attack that severely damaged Iraqi infrastructure and the pre 2003 inspections are glossed over. Those to peices of evidence make Bush\u0027s claims of WMD\u0027s a lot less credible than Clinton\u0027s. Linking Iraq to WMDs in 1998 is a different scenario from linking Iraq to WMDs in 2003 because of the events that transpired before the 2003 invasion. \n\nI do not believe this blog post provided enough evidence to support its claim that Clinton was the first to link Iraq to WMDs and Al-Queda compared to Bush in 2003. The WMD comparison is not an even comparison and the Al-Queda connection does not really seem to be there during the Clinton administration. \n\nIs there evidence I am missing?
