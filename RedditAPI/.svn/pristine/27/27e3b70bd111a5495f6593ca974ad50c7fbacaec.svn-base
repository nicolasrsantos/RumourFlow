ISIS has spread outside of Iraq and Syria to Afghanistan, Libya, Egypt, and other parts of North Africa. We have not been working adequately with other governments abroad to track and stop its spread and have instead focused almost all of our attention on Iraq and Syria.\n\n2. We have telegraphed every military action we have taken and even planned to this point. As a general rule you DO NOT tell the enemy when and where you are planning to attack as we have in the case of Mosul. Also tying into this is our recent history of telegraphing withdrawals with detailed time tables. We also had al Qaeda on its heels a few years back, but soon after our withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan they have begun a resurgence (albeit one overshadowed by ISIS). Last year alone the Afghani security forces suffered more casualties and deaths than NATO forces did in the entirety of a 10+ year war.\n\n3. The US and its allies are consistently behind in tracking and stopping recent converts and sympathizers. On the few occasions that we have managed to stop sympathizers, we end up imprisoning them alongside far more dangerous jihadists who serve to further radicalize them, a la the Charlie Hebdo attackers.\n\n4. We have made no attempts to reach out to and prevent the radicalization of more people.

It is the same way you treat a retarded kid; they get different rules, and we don\u0027t expect them to be able to behave like regular people. \n\nWhy do we have one set of rational, common-sense behavioral expectations for regular groups of people in this country and the world, religious or not, and then a set of junior high (or short bus) standards or expectations for Muslims? \n\nThis is not smart or intelligent diplomacy. It is a clear declaration of our contempt for these backward and delusional people. We don\u0027t expect them to act like intelligent and rational human beings, we assume they are savages and we feel sorry for them and then want to pity them with our \u0027enlightened understanding\u0027 of their culture. \n\nIt\u0027s like the administration is trying to attack the issue of ISIS and Islamic barbarism like it\u0027s a sociological pathology.

He, unfortunately, is a coward who can not implement policies that hurt people.\n\nWhat does this mean? You mean like Obama go and send Assad military aid? Sorry man but this is really loony. The USA was never going to send aid to one of Russia and Iran\u0027s proxies. Its not even a question of whether its a good idea. In no universe would that have happened. We would have lost roughly 100% of our Arab allies in about half a second. \n\nAnd no, he did not back the rebellion. The US aid has been truely negligible. The USA started sending small traceable weapons to test to see whether there were any trust worthy rebel groups that wouldnt get coopted by extremists, but the programs ended when the weapons got sold or captured. The USA has essentially done nothing, all the major aid for the rebels comes from UAE, Qatar, SA, and Turkey. The USA is not the center of the universe.

Maliki\u0027s party won the parliamentary elections. Obama cant take out the democratic leader of Iraq. I dont know what you are imagining, but again, this is US-centrism. \n\n\n\u0026gt; I also don\u0027t know how the loss of intelligence in Yemen isn\u0027t negative?

I\u0027m really at a loss here.\n\nWant to specify how Iran is undermining US interests? How is Iran disrupting any US interests by gaining allies. It isnt. If you disagree then get specific. The only times when Iran has been at odds with our interests is when we have directly clashed with their military. We dont have different ideas for what the region should look like. We both support the same government in Iraq. We both support the same government in Afghanistan. We both want a stable region. You cant be so vague.

You wanted to get rid of a dictator on the cheap without spending the money and resources to do it successfully. I\u0027ll sit here and criticize you, Obama, and anyone else who supported his op in Libya because of what\u0027s happened. Obama always had the power to say no, he simply was too weak to do it.\n \nObama is to blame for Nouri al-Maliki\u0027s partisan politics that border on intentional religious cleansing? We left. What al-Maliki did after that has nothing to do with Obama. Unlike the Iraq War, the goals of the NATO in the Libyan Civil War intervention wasn\u0027t to rebuild Libya, it was to get rid of Gaddafi\u0027s government so the Libyans could rebuild themselves. Despite the grave security situation in Libya, it actually has one of the most democratic governments in the region now (which cannot be said for Iraq). We aren\u0027t tied to those countries at the waist, we owe the nothing beyond what we have already given them and if they fuck up with what we gave them, that\u0027s not on us.

This time the Americans asked them to take a stand on the question of immunity for troops, hoping to remove what had always been the most difficult hurdle. But they misread Iraqi politics and the Iraqi public. Still burdened by the traumas of this and previous wars, and having watched the revolutions sweeping their region, the Iraqis were unwilling to accept anything that infringed on their sovereignty.\n\nAcutely aware of that sentiment, the Iraqi leadership quickly said publicly that they would not support legal protections for any American troops. Some American officials have privately said that pushing for that meeting — in essence forcing the Iraqis to take a public stand on such a controversial matter before working out the politics of presenting it to their constituents and to Parliament — was a severe tactical mistake that ended any possibility of keeping American troops here past December.\"","duration":"","id":56,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_cp03udj","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":55,"links":[54],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"kebababab","label":"\u0026gt; People like to throw out how Obama didn\u0027t try to keep the troops in Iraq (when he was elected on a platform to do the opposite...) but in actuality, the administration lobbied the Iraqis hard.  \n\nDid he though?
