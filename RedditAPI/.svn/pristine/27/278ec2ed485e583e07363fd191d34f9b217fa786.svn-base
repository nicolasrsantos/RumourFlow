Newsflash - people are stupid and they breed.

A non minuscule percentage of people in Middle America believe the earth is less then 10,000 years old. Stupidity abounds. 
Nothing personal regarding your father but in this day and age anyone who relies on one source of information for their "news" is stupid. Especially if that source is Fox News.
Hopefully not just reddit.

It's this kind of honesty we need to see from our leaders.
Ah, the "everyone's too busy" excuse. 

It took me 30 seconds to verify that Obama has Christian listed as his religion on Wikipedia. 

I'm not endorsing Wikipedia as an authoritative source just as an alternate source. Finding a difference there from what O'Reilly says should spur SMART people to spend an additional few minutes to figure out [which](http://obama.senate.gov/about/) is [true](http://www.barackobama.com/about/).
If the only reason you won't vote for him is because you think he is a Muslim, which seems to be wrong according to numerous sources, then you are voting on incorrect information. Smart people shouldn't do that which is an obvious offshoot of this whole thread.
I'll re-phrase my original comment. Anyone who listens to O'Reilly for news is stupid.
