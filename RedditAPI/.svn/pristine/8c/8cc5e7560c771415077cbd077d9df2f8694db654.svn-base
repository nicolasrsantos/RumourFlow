yeah, executives don't know hard work, because digging ditches like a real american is the only real work
Working 16 hours and having tons of stress and everything else involved in an executive's life can, and is, easily classified as hard work. You aren't giving the impression that you have a clue what an executive does or how difficult their work can be, which is what this thread is all about- so many Democrats think only blue collar workers work hard.
...and executives can, and do, have those, as well.
Except Republicans don't want all guns to be legal and lots of Democrats don't want all abortions to be legal. Like, say, partial birth abortion.
"No character whatsoever"? You might be what this thread is all about.
