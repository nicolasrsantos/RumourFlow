Even if he is a Muslim, why does it matter?  The fact that the GOP has such a bigoted stance towards non-Christians is a very, *very* big turn off for me.
Because our...less gifted countrymen think that all Muslims want to destroy America.  Republicans hate Obama, and will say and do anything to make sure he is out of office at any cost, so they call him a Muslim and stupid people latch onto the Republican's hatred of the man.
Because I've seen zero hatred for Mitt's Mormanism.
It's called the real world.  Christianity is **not** a minority in America and Mormonism *is* a Christian religion, so the people on the far right have no issue with it.  Liberals, moderates, and the generic guy/girl next door could give a rats ass about somebody's religion, because they understand that faith is someones personal choice and they're respectful of that.
Where?  I haven't seen any.  I've seen enough hatred of Obama for supposedly being a Muslim; and I've seen a lot of hatred on the right for Islam.  If you're looking for people who discriminate against religions, look to the right - particularly Michelle Bachmann, Joe Walsh, Newt Gingrich, and Herman Cain.  Bachmann is bringing back McCarthyism, only instead of ranting about communists, she's ranting about the Muslim Brotherhood supposedly infiltrating the US and being in league with President Obama.  Walsh told constituents in a town hall meeting in Chicago that Muslims are planning on killing them.  Gingrich and Cain both claim that Muslims want to impose Sharia Law on the US.  So if you're looking for religious discrimination, look at how Muslims are being treated.  Mormonism is a Christian religion, and Christianity is not a minority in this country; few people will be turned off by it.
I am not advocating the persecution of Mormons or any religion for that matter, so please do not put words in my mouth.  I was making an observation about what I've seen in the current political climate.
I actually check out /r/politics, and I don't see a lot of hatred of Mitt's Mormonism.  There's the occasional /r/atheism troll, but those people just hate religion period so I don't think playing the victim card for Mitt will work in that instance.
