Not an American so hopefully I can give a relatively unbiased opinion: 95% of people who vote Republican on the federal level are idiots. The remaining 5% are evil/selfish.
Okay. I mean, it's true? Why would you vote for a republican on a federal level?
Bigot? Republican is a race now? Yeesh...
No it's not. For instance to be super hyperbolic, if I call all people who believe in homeopathy idiots that doesn't make me intolerant, also tolerance doesn't mean I have to say other peoples views aren't stupid if I think they are. Tolerance is tolerating others existence. I in no way deny service or anything else from Republicans. But they are idiots. Mostly.
I mean okay I guess. I'm all fine with right wing views, but the Republican party of America is extraordinarily bought and paid for, as well as just generally hugely incompetant. Beyond that the 95% of idiots who are voting for them are idiots because they're voting against their own interests, not because Republican ideals themselves are neccessarily idiotic, though they often are. Regardless I'm not intolerant of Republicans, I never interact with them, I don't live in America, but calling idiotic behavior idiotic isn't bigotry. 
What am I basing American Republicans being bought and paid for and incompetent? Congress and the Bush presidencies? Randomly pick 30 republicans in the house and look at their last 100 votes as well as their donors and you will find tons of conflict of interest on 95% of them. Beyond that Republican policy is not economically sound and hasn't been for ages. Beyond that randomly attacking middle eastern countries is not good foreign policy, I could go on and on, but suffice to say, just because their half your government, and just because the other half also sort of sucks and is corrupt doesn't mean I have to not call a spade a spade. Republicans are bought and paid for. 95% of voters who vote for them are voting against their own financial interests, and their governence has a negative effect on your country. Ignoring these facts because it's intolerant not to is stupid, and you guys are all about free speech. This is my free and honest opinion. Disagree if you like, but the post is literally about how over half of Republicans believe something that's just fucking stupid. Not something that's just wrong, trickle down economics is just wrong, this is 54% of them believing something straight up retarded. Full retard. 54% of Republican voters are fully retarded. There I said it. I understand that this subreddit is about political discussion and moderates, but the American political spectrum is not centered around the actual political spectrum. "Realty has a well known liberal bias".
Again, I'm not from the States.
