Those that do just want to feel as if they\u0027re part of the system and do it mainly for show; they\u0027ll go for Obama.  \n\nConverts are one of three types: A) white liberals who would vote for Obama anyway, B) blacks who would vote for Obama anyway, C) don\u0027t vote.\n\nSons and daughters of immigrant Muslims are Americanized liberals (gentrified whites basically) who will vote for Obama or won\u0027t vote.\n\nThe few Muslims who would vote Republican are usually beyond the pale of Islam, preparing to write their newest expose on the religion and picking out an outfit for an upcoming FOX News interview. \n\nSo pandering for the Muslim vote doesn\u0027t much matter.  When Muslims can (or decide to) throw around AIPAC amounts of cash then they will matter.  Until then, keep pretending that voting means anything.","duration":"","id":65,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c6y8bir","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"The Muslim vote helped Obama defeat Romney in the 2012 Presidential Election","label":"mandazi","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_12suuc","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.352332401E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.352395299E9,"simScore":0.602007152472287,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},{"index":66,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"arabredditor","label":"This circlejerk has come to this subreddit now,i geuss even Muslims are bound to be brainwashed.","duration":"","id":66,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_c6xwlda","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"The Muslim vote helped Obama defeat Romney in the 2012 Presidential Election","label":"mandazi","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_12suuc","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.352332401E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.352344858E9,"simScore":0.7768749911338091,"sentiment":"  Negative"},{"index":67,"links":[66],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"alwaysdownvoted-","label":"It\u0027s rather astounding, as if this is a victory for Muslims everywhere.
