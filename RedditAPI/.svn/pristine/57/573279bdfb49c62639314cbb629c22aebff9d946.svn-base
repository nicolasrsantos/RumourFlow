From the videos that went around, he wasn't very Christian. This feeds into the perception that the president is Christian in appearance only.
I do not think the president is Muslim. I also don't think Rev Wright preaches tolerance and other Christian principles, at least from the video that were widely available. With so much anger directed at the religious right, I am surprised people tolerate Wright's vitriol.

All I said was that those videos made Obama look bad and fed people's perceptions if they didn't like him.

Agreed. Most wear religion has a badge so the religious will accept them.
No, I don't think so.
