On a related note:

"Chem-trails" is my cue to hit the eject button in a conversation.
You know what really freaks these people out? Cloud seeding- which is where planes will purposely fly and leave extra persistent and thick contrails to help with cloud formation in dry areas.

You made me laugh. Though cloud seeding is a real thing, and quite a benefit to farmers.

Also, I just learned the HAARP program is sometimes used in chem-trail conspiracy circles as "control center" for everything.
What if I like guns and gays? And support weed legalization?
Right? How much better off would America be with loads of electricity from a non-coal/oil source that is clean and would help employ educated people.

Also, nuclear power plants can't "explode" like apparently a lot of people think they can. Chernoybl was a meltdown made worse by corner-cutting Soviet design, and 3-mile Island was not bad at all and contained quickly.
Nuclear power generators can not cause a nuclear explosion. Completely different types of nuclear material. The idea that crashing a plane will cause an Atom Bomb to go off is complete ignorance.
