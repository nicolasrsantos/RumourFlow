Oh, and I think the Mossberg is sometimes lauded for its double-claw extractor, though I\u0027ve never heard of the 870 *having* extraction issues so I don\u0027t know that I\u0027d count that as a point for the Mossberg against the 870.","Yup!!!  The safety placement on the Mossberg is what puts it head and shoulders above the 870 for me, putting the safety on the triggerguard like Remington did was a *terrible* move.","You can own pistols for target shooting in France, right? I was under the impression you could and it wasn\u0027t that big a deal.  I also heard that you *can* use a firearm for self-defense if someone breaks into your home and threatens you.","Have you shot them a *lot*, especially in draw-and-shoot type scenarios designed to simulate having to use a pistol in self-defense?  Do you own one (or some)? If no then shut the fuck up, you have *no* idea what you\u0027re talking about.  If yes, then fine, carry on and do what you like.","A large part of the reason for his suggestion of a Glock 19 is because a lot of people will be Americans looking for a carry gun.  If you\u0027re not going to carry it or use it for defense (you\u0027re not) then your options are *much* more open, a Sig 226 would be a *great* choice for a range gun and, as a range gun, it doesn\u0027t have any disadvantages compared to the Glock, in fact it would probably be a better range gun than the G19 because of the longer sight radius, nice single-action trigger, and better ergonomics.  As a Sig-nut who carries a Glock 19 every day for protection, I\u0027d probably tell you to get a nice P226, you\u0027ll love it.\n\nYou could also go with a plethora of other things, such as a Beretta 92 or CZ-75 or Browning Hi-Power, without going wrong at all.  A lot of the factors that apply to people on here asking about which handgun to get do not apply to *you* because a lot of those people, probably most, are Americans like me who intend to use the gun for concealed carry and/or home defense.  For *you* a Glock 19/17 wouldn\u0027t have any advantage over a CZ-75 or P226, *if* the only thing you\u0027re going to use it for is target shooting at the range (you are).","Yes, absolutely.  The only reason to choose a 19 over a 17 or 34 (Glock) is for concealability, and if you don\u0027t intend to conceal it then there\u0027s really no point in bothering with the compact and subcompact Glocks.  Also, owning and having fired both extensively, I really feel like you\u0027ll get a lot more enjoyment out of shooting the P226 at the range, the classic Sig P-series guns really excel at target shooting, they\u0027re exceptionally accurate (slightly more so than the Glocks, not anywhere near enough to make a difference in combat--like maybe 1/2\" difference at 25 meters--but enough that a competent target shooter will notice) and easier to shoot well with their single-action trigger.  Plus you\u0027ve got some *really* nice target pistol options with the P226 series: I\u0027m talking about the fantastic X-5 and X-6 series of guns from Sig: http://sigsauer.com/CatalogProductList/pistols-p226-x-five.aspx","Now you\u0027re talking about personal preference, but here\u0027s why I think the Glock platform is far superior to the XD:\n\n-No one uses the XD pistols, I mean no one reputable.  It doesn\u0027t have a proven track record with any reputable military or LE group.  It\u0027s used by a *very* few police departments (the number that use it in the U.S. can be counted on one hand) and the Croatian military and something you have to take into account there is that it\u0027s manufactured in Croatia and was originally invented in Croatia, and when it comes to weapons militaries the world over are typically *very* heavily pressured to buy domestic, so the fact that the XD is made in Croatia probably had a *lot* to do with why the Croatian military chose it as their standard issue sidearm.\n\n-Glock, on the other hand...well, do I even need to start listing all the major military and LE agencies and units that use it? NYPD, DEA, FBI, U.S. Army Delta Force, NY State Police, French Special Forces, GSG-9 (German Federal Police special operations), IDF, Russian MVD Special Forces, CO-19 of the London Met, and many more.  [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glock#Users) is a more comprehensive list if you\u0027re curious.\n\n-I really don\u0027t like the grip safety on the XD--why? Because it\u0027s an extra moving part that doesn\u0027t need to be there, it\u0027s just one more thing that can break and jam up the gun.  There\u0027s also the off chance that you won\u0027t fully depress it in an emergency and therefore won\u0027t be able to fire the weapon and therefore you\u0027ll die.\n\n-I also think the G19 is *the* perfect size for CCW, and there isn\u0027t a corresponding XD model to match it (one with at least a 3.8\" barrel so you don\u0027t lose too much velocity and a height such that it\u0027s *just* big enough for you to get a full grip on the pistol but no taller).  5 inches tall is *perfect*.  Height makes more of a difference with regards to concealability than *any other measurement*, so you don\u0027t want the gun to be any taller than it absolutely has to be, but you (I, at least) want to be able to get a full grip on it--the G19 is the shortest, most compact, pistol out there that you can get a full and proper grip on and which has a 4\" barrel.  It really is the perfect size.\n\n-Glock has more aftermarket support and accessories, but of course the XD has plenty as well.  Not that big a deal.\n\nI just really don\u0027t like the XD because nobody reputable wants to use it, and that plus the fact that it\u0027s been around *plenty* long enough (over a decade now) to have been adopted by a ton of agencies and military units, speaks volumes as far as I\u0027m concerned.","For what it\u0027s worth it happened to me, with my 19, I solved it by dremeling away as much of the trigger guard near the frame as I could to give my hand more room.  That G19 is now my carry piece.","I constantly had it happen with mine (my pinkie always got pinched) until I took a dremel to the underside of the triggerguard near the frame and made about a a sixth of an inch more room for my hand, that solved the problem.","Look at a Walther PPQ."],"mjk1093":["SB shooter was probably getting laid, but his wife looked like a dude in a hijab, so maybe not much difference.","You can ban a nationality, but not a religion.

In America we have no religious test for office, but in the U.K. Catholics are still banned from serving as Prime Minister.  I think that bias against Catholics in the year 2007 is worthy of scorn, yet I understand why it is a black person can be prime minister but not a Catholic.  I think Blair wouldn\u0027t have been worse or better had he been allowed to convert and that the U.K. should do away with that restriction.\r\n\r\nAs for a Muslim becoming President of the United States of America, perhaps we should think hypothetically about members of other religions being elected to the most powerful office on the planet.  Should Americans consider electing a candidate who declares he is personally a devout Satanist but that his private worship of the devil in no way would influence how he leads the nation?  Let\u0027s say a Branch Davidian wanted to be elected President and when pressed declared that David Koresh was a prophet but that what happened at Waco was a moment from his religion\u0027s past, should people accept that this private religious affiliation didn\u0027t have bearing on leadership ability?  Maybe a practitioner of Ayum Shinriko wants to rule, does this strike anyone as troubling?\r\n\r\nIn the largely secular West people tend to think of religion as little more than a private tradition which takes up at most an hour or so on the weekends, but this is not the case for sincerely devout people.  A devout Jew is Jewish not just on Saturdays and the same goes for anyone who is sincerely religious.  Different belief systems lead to different world views.  A Manichaean would be a very different President than a Donatist.","[This is the most recent article I recall, but it concerns the royalty.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml\u003d/news/2007/08/03/npeter103.xml) Excerpt:\r\n\r\n\u0026gt;Peter Phillips, the Queen\u0027s eldest grandson, may have to give up his place in the line of succession to the throne after it emerged that his bride-to-be is a Roman Catholic.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\u0026gt;Peter Phillips is engaged to Autumn Kelly, a Canadian who was baptised as a Catholic\r\n\r\n \r\n\u0026gt;The engagement between the 29-year-old son of the Princess Royal and Autumn Kelly, a Canadian management consultant, was announced by Buckingham Palace last week.

I\u0027m assuming you haven\u0027t read either if you\u0027re quoting Bible verses out of context like that.\n\n\u0026gt;You\u0027ll hear excuses such as \"Well that\u0027s the OT\" or \"You have to understand the context\" or \"That only applied to Israelites\", so on and so forth. Same atrocities, different days.\n\nNot sure why you see them as excuses instead of reasons. A doctrinal difference between Christianity and Islam is that in Christianity, the doctrines fundamental principles of peace and selfless love resists the more primitive and barbaric scriptures, but with Islam, anything in the doctrine that promotes peace is later abrogated by the conversion by sword principles.\n\nYou can point to the bad bible verses all day long but will just be met with some New Testament abrogation of those verses. It\u0027s the other way around for Islam. That\u0027s a dangerous and significant difference.\n\nBasically, you can use the Christian doctrine to decouple violence from Christian religious principles. You *can not* use Islamic doctrine to decouple violence from Islamic religious principles. Just because these two religions have both promoted violence from its followers does not mean they are both analogous in relation to their philosophy on aggressive behavior. Christian doctrine contains a leash on the violence in the New Testament. Islamic doctrine has no leash on its violence other than the sand-burying reaction of the individual Muslim and their comprehension of their own holy scripture.","\u0026gt;How many people are dead in Iraq because god told George fucking Bush to invade?!?\n\nIf you think that Bush\u0027s alleged belief in the Christian god is the reasoning behind sending troops to Iraq, or the Middle East in general, then you\u0027ve been mistaken.","This is misleading. Here\u0027s why.\n\n\u0026gt;That is violence and death as a scale ISIS can never imagine.\n\nEven if I granted you this as fact, it wouldn\u0027t compare to the scale of Muslim extremism in general. It\u0027s very disingenuous to compare all current murdering Christians with *just* ISIS when talking about the level of violence being promoted by these two religions. (Really, there\u0027s nothing too special about ISIS in regard to Islamic doctrine. There is, however, much controversy regarding Christian doctrine in relation to Christians who are murdering others under abrogated Abrahamic doctrine).\n\nAlso, and more importantly--\n\n\u0026gt;These days Christian violence still exists. Look at the Evangelical Christians in Uganda who got the government there to start killing gay people in gods name.\nLook at the worshipers of Christ in Russia - who are also murdering gay people.\nLook at the pope insisting birth control including basic disease prevention is amoral, even if you live in Africa and you KNOW your husband has AIDS.\n\nAll these \"christians\" are doing this in the name of their misunderstood perception of the Christian god. They\u0027re cherry picking the violence promotion and they\u0027re neglecting their own religious doctrine when it comes to functional and peaceful behavior.\n\nBut, ISIS, as well as all the other Muslim \"extremists?\" They\u0027re not misunderstanding anything in Islamic doctrine. They\u0027re following it down to every collective principle and religious motivation. They\u0027re only murdering people because they\u0027re not ignoring the doctrine\u0027s unabashed aggressive influence.\n\nThis is quite a significant distinction I\u0027ve pointed out between the two religions and their corresponding doctrines. This is the distinction that\u0027s key to understanding in the concern for Muslims and Islamic influence.","Really? I don\u0027t see how his point doesn\u0027t still stand even if you account for all the murdering Christians around the globe today.

Ok. Doesn\u0027t this mean they feel this way because of people who aren\u0027t taking what Hinkley said seriously?

Didn\u0027t realize they declared war against the world and seek to take it over by attacking western targets, if that\u0027s what you are getting at ;)  I was too busy being waterborded by CNN with nonstop coverage of the same thing happening over and over in the middle east to learn about the rest of the world this month.

IF the buddhists took over part of China, took slaves, beheaded people on TV and declared war on the west, then went and killed westerners in western cities, then they would recieve similar attention.  But a local religious conflict that stays local, in a country with no resources we need where the government has kind of isolated it from the rest of the world?  No, we\u0027re not going to give that much attention, unless they try to build nukes.  Then they get North Korea type attention.","\u0026gt; Muslim radicals need to join the civilized world and instigate cold wars and trade embargoes instead. Lol.\n\nAs funny as that is, you\u0027re also revealing a great truth there.  The one time they got their shit together and acted modern - OPEC - they managed to rain hell on western nations and suck a lot of money out of us.  Then they went and spent it on solid gold camels and shit.  Fact is, American and European leaders have the job of outcompeting other countries and the mandate to do so through voting.  It shouldn\u0027t be a surprise to other countries when they do that.  Meanwhile the friggin kings and \"rulers\" of the middle eastern nation act like what they are, which is basically the temporary land owner installed by force and out for himself.  So it\u0027s like the people there wonder why they are going nowhere, but they have no representative to work for them, just one with a vested interest in them not overthrowing him, and then they wonder why our representatives don\u0027t help them get the better of us.  Maybe if they produced something more than strife, and had some leaders that could make good business deals they would be able to have some leverage beyond the ever-dwindling leverage oil gave them for a few decades.  Once renewables hit a certain mark, they are going to have nothing to offer the world, so we\u0027ll just ignore them like they are Africa.  Then they are really fucked.  If North Korea had valuable minerals we needed, you think we\u0027d be letting Kim starve people?  Fuck no, we\u0027d make a back door deal with China and overthrow the place.","\u0026gt; Central China also hasn\u0027t been subject to massive social upheaval and invasion by a foreign military\n\nDid we forget imperial Japan?  Because that was more recent than a lot of the shit ISIS bitches about, like Britain and France making borders after the Ottoman Empire fell, because someone had to do it and they couldn\u0027t get their shit together back then either.  As much as the Iraq war was wrong, it\u0027s not what caused either 9/11 or the Arab Spring.  Syrians revolted in Syria, the crusader armies didn\u0027t invade.  Lybians revolted in Lybia, Egyptians revolted in Egypt.  They are lacking a heavy dose of personal accountability and filling the void with a false persecution narrative.\n\nSocial upheaval - China has had that.  It\u0027s become enormously wealthy in the past decades, much like the Middle East, but they didn\u0027t just buy gold cars with it, and the people didn\u0027t resist change as against god, they built and used the cell phones.  Chinese go with the change, they don\u0027t try to stop it and restart the Ming Dynasty.  And still the government has problems to deal with.\n\nAs for the religious Civil War, you are absolutely right.  They need a protestant style reformation, and how.","\u0026gt; How disingenuous is it to pretend as though people inside the Muslim community aren\u0027t better positioned to spot and report possible extremism than other Americans? \n\nYup.  It is exactly like a gang neighborhood or a mafia neighborhood.  The normal people still know who is who and what is going on around them.  There\u0027s plenty of places to give anonymous tips, but they don\u0027t. They still identify with the criminals because both are X(Italian/black/muslim, etc.), and nothing will change until they are able to separate it in their minds.\n","I don\u0027t know where you live, but \"what the hell I am talking about\" is this:  If you live in a housing project in NYC, you know who the gang members are if there are any, or \u0027that apartment\u0027 that sells drugs.  If you were an Italian in an italian neighborhood in the 40s, you knew who the connected guys were.  If you go to the mosque, and the imam is preaching hate, or some of the congregants do, you know who they are. They don\u0027t need to be \"advertising what they plan\" before they get reported.  They should get reported before that. Your ONE personal anecdote, and the low bar you set with it,  does not invalidate the concept of needing local informants as eyes and ears for law enforcement.  \n\n\u0026gt; That is why over a third of terror plots are foiled by community members reporting them. \n\nGood start, set that bar a little higher and maybe it\u0027ll move up to two thirds.  Don\u0027t wait until they reveal a plan.  It\u0027s the ideology(Mafia/Gangs/religious extremism) that is the danger, the plan is just a product of it.  You don\u0027t want a local to say \u0027the mob is going to hit this place on this day\u0027 to the police, you want them to say \u0027these guys are in the mob, watch them\u0027.  Then you can collect evidence, maybe bring the whole mob family down, instead of just arresting two guys for a robbery.","Ok, from the username and the \u0027we\u0027 I\u0027m assuming you are muslim. Going to guess America, but maybe UK. So here\u0027s my questions - Do you guys talk to each other about Islam and these issues or just pray then go home?  Are there some people who think the headscarf is silly while other say nothing but the eyes should show?   Are there people who think sharia law should replace US/UK law, at least in your communities?  Are there people who express support for the ideas behind the radicals, if not their methods? People who blame the west a lot for all the problems?  If so, those people are more likely to become radicals, and should be reported. That doesn\u0027t mean they will go to jail, just that they will be looked at closer.\n\nThe mafia or a gang replaces normal law and order with their own brand of it.  Wanting Omerta or Sharia, the concept is the same, be it preached by an imam at a mosque or by a godfather at his daughter\u0027s wedding.  That\u0027s what we need, and what we mean when we say we need help rooting them out.  Otherwise, we end up having to look at all the muslims, and guys like Trump gain traction.  But if there really are no signs like that at all, and they act fully assimilated, then you have much larger and more systemic problems, and it\u0027s going to continue like this for some time. But I\u0027ve seen things like videos of guys talking in UK universities about how sharia should be law.  There is video evidence out there of answers to my above questions, and it seems like a lot of people are very open about their extremist beliefs.  They need to be reported, not tolerated or agreed with, and certainly not given a microphone.","\u0026gt; For some reason, they seem to be much more open about it in the UK \n\nI think it\u0027s a lot easier to get there, and frankly we\u0027re a little scarier, Americans.  Some guy starts screaming that crap outdoors and the truck nutz crowd goes ape shit.  Their our version of those guys.  UK doesn\u0027t have that as much.  \n\nIt\u0027s good that guy was reported, and not allowed to flourish.  The hard part is continuing to persevere with it, knowing it\u0027s still going to take time before a lot of the world wide image is changed. IMO, a lot of work needs to be done explaining the differences within Islam.  Because people don\u0027t realize what any ideological differences are.  It\u0027s just \u0027those ones wanted Mohammeds grandson, and those ones wanted his nephew 800 years ago, and they are still arguing\u0027.  Which sects eject sharia, which ones allow women to dress in their own way, they need to be promoted.  In a lot of western countries, advocating for overthrowing the law is sedition.  Marraige under a certain age is statutory rape.  Forcing your wife to dress or act a certain way is domestic abuse.  It happens in all the religions(mormons come to mind first), and it doesn\u0027t get reported, instead they isolate from society further.","We have a saying like that in English - \"Snitches get stiches\". \n\nUntil people in those areas, be they gang controlled, mafia controlled or extremist controlled stop being basically stupid enough to follow the rule made by their abuser that says it\u0027s bad to turn them in for being abusive, the people in those areas will continue to be the wife with a black eye trying to convince herself that her husband hits her because he loves her.  And if my metaphor goes on for too long, everyone else in the neighborhood ends up ignoring you, not inviting you over, and not being surprised if you end up dead, because you did it to yourself.  Everyone tried to help, but you wouldn\u0027t leave your abuser, so we stopped trying to help.  That\u0027s what will happen.  If it goes on long enough, a majority will eventually say \"Trump is right, it\u0027s better to just not deal with them at all and keep them away because they are unpleasant.\"  And then guys like ISIS will run the show over there and all those good muslims we deport will be in an even worse place, being hit even harder, because now they know there is nobody that will stop them.  \n\n","\u0026gt; So many Muslim immigrants don\u0027t want to assimilate, and hate the culture they are joining. \n\nIn NYC, you see the same thing with the Hassidic Jewish people.  I imagine it\u0027s similar.  I know I feel a similar way to how you describe.  They don\u0027t want to assimilate, and act like they are just dealing with the other as much as they need to, but not a second longer.

A group of up to a dozen police officers on a specialized narcotics team were found to have planted drugs and weapons on young black men for years. They were supervised at the time by Lt. Steve Parrish, current Dothan Police Chief, and Sgt. Andy Hughes, current Asst. Director of Homeland Security for the State of Alabama. All of the officers reportedly were members of a Neoconfederate organization that the Southern Poverty Law Center labels �racial extremists.� The group has advocated for blacks to �return� to Africa, published that the civil rights movement is really a Jewish conspiracy, and that blacks have lower IQ�s . Both Parrish and Hughes held leadership positions in the group and are pictured above holding a confederate battle flag at one of the club�s secret meetings.\n\n\u0026gt;The documents shared reveal that the internal affairs investigation was covered up to protect the aforementioned officers� law enforcement careers and keep them from being criminally prosecuted.\n\n\u0026gt;Several long term Dothan law enforcement officers, all part of an original group that initiated the investigation, believe the public has a right to know that the Dothan Police Department, and District Attorney Doug Valeska, targeted young black men by planting drugs and weapons on them over a decade. Most of the young men were prosecuted, many sentenced to prison, and some are still in prison.  Many of the officers involved were subsequently promoted and are in leadership positions in law enforcement. They hope the mood of the country is one that demands action and that the US Department of Justice will intervene.\n\nAnother good example is in Ferguson, and the way the local cops were basically extorting the local working-class Black population to raise money for the (overwhelmingly White) local government.

They don\u0027t deny the bad parts exist, they just don\u0027t think its productive to follow those parts nor do they think those parts do anything meaningful for society.

On the other, they\u0027re kinda manipulating the masses through their religion by tugging on the disenfranchised and abandoned in the community. Honestly they\u0027re no different than the uber-Christian politicians that claim that there\u0027s a war on Christianity.

Acting on that ideal has done nothing but disenfranchise people in this country. Being stopped by a cop and told \"you could have an rpg in your pocket\", being told \"well in your country it might work this way but in this country it works that way\" as if I wasn\u0027t BORN AND RAISED HERE which should be obvious from my lack of an accent, and being verbally attacked by people with absolutely no knowledge about me and given no chance to defend myself because \"you\u0027re just a lying dirty Muslim\".

That does nothing positive.\n\nUnderstand that a majority of the victims in terrorist attacks as a whole are muslims. Or did you forget that ISIS is located in the middle east, which has a much higher percentage of muslims? ISIS kills anyone that doesn\u0027t follow what they say, even muslims. Alienating those muslims is going to drive them back towards ISIS and lead to them adopting ISIS\u0027s brand of islam, which is a literal interpretation of islam, because they see the west has abandoned them just like ISIS said they would.","Great. That\u0027s in those countries.

No, 88% of the muslims that were GIVEN THE TEST support that. If we could give every muslim in this country that test and the numbers come up like that, ok. But looking at part of the equation and saying \"yep we know now that x% of the sample support y, so even if done on a large scale it would be the same\". That\u0027s inaccurate. \n\nIf you want the truth, you have to give **every** muslim in the country that same test, which would be extremely difficult to do but still possible.

To suggest this shows that you have no idea about the politics of the region. Bush would have done exactly nothing to stop the Arab spring and disintegration of the Syrian state. This is ridiculous partisanship. Its like blaming the Congo war on Bush, or the North Korean famine on Clinton. \n\nIraq is a consequence of Syria. Bush signed agreements to remove American soldiers from Iraq exactly when Obama removed them from Iraq. The Iraqi government refused to renew the permission for American troops to stay. No president could have done something about that. Then Syria happened which allowed ISIS to reinvade Iraq after gaining strength in Syria. \n\nThe Yemeni government has fallen but it has had exactly zero negative effects on US interests. Al Qaeda has not taken over. There is no problem there for US interests unless you are just reflexively anti-Shia. \n\nLibya is the only one where Obama had real agency, although its still hard to see what Obama should have done differently, other than just not participated in the NATO intervention to prevent Qaddafi from destroying Benghazi. \n\n\n\nSince Obama has reengaged in the region with airstrikes ISIS has seen many military defeats and is now receding.

Instead, he decided to irresponsibly back an armed rebellion he had no intention of seeing through though to the end. He, unfortunately, is a coward who can not implement policies that hurt people.\n\nWhat does this mean? You mean like Obama go and send Assad military aid? Sorry man but this is really loony. The USA was never going to send aid to one of Russia and Iran\u0027s proxies. Its not even a question of whether its a good idea. In no universe would that have happened. We would have lost roughly 100% of our Arab allies in about half a second. \n\nAnd no, he did not back the rebellion. The US aid has been truely negligible. The USA started sending small traceable weapons to test to see whether there were any trust worthy rebel groups that wouldnt get coopted by extremists, but the programs ended when the weapons got sold or captured. The USA has essentially done nothing, all the major aid for the rebels comes from UAE, Qatar, SA, and Turkey. The USA is not the center of the universe. We dont micromanage events everywhere in the world. Sometimes civil wars happen. They have happened countless times. The USA was never blamed for it until now when people are now willing to turn off their brains in order to make literally everything look like its Obama\u0027s fault. \n\n\u0026gt; If Iraq went to shit, that\u0027s frankly a failure of his administration. There was nothing preventing him from making major changes while he was in office. I honestly don\u0027t know how you can say this wasn\u0027t his fault with a straight face.\n\nWant to specify what you are talking about? The Bush administration backed Maliki. Maliki\u0027s party won the parliamentary elections. Obama cant take out the democratic leader of Iraq.

The only times when Iran has been at odds with our interests is when we have directly clashed with their military. We dont have different ideas for what the region should look like. We both support the same government in Iraq. We both support the same government in Afghanistan. We both want a stable region. You cant be so vague. Specify which interests are at stake in Yemen that Iran is threatening. \n\n","I mean why would a president hypothetically fight so hard to free themselves from the terms of the SOFA?

I don\u0027t believe all Muslims are our enemies, however I do believe that Islam is a misogynistic, brutal, superstitious, somewhat aggressively militaristic doctrine that\u0027s harmful to humanity at large.  I recognize that individual Muslims can sometimes avoid literalism and avoid enacting the worst parts of the Islamic doctrine.  But I also recognize that as long as these \"moderates\" support the Islamic doctrine as is, together with all the ahadith and various hateful and bigoted commentaries by various clerics, they are passively and quietly promoting harm.

I think that while there is a lot to criticize about both Christianity and Islam, Islam is not in fact exactly like Christianity.  Islam is markedly more brutal and markedly more militaristic and political than Christianity is, when it comes to central doctrinal writings and how they are usually interpreted.\n\nI don\u0027t know any Christian nation or even any currently practicing Christian sect that stones adulterers or amputates limbs for theft.  While Christians have crusaded in the past, there is no doctrinal support for crusading in the Bible.  At the same time, there is doctrinal support for military jihad in both the Qur\u0027an and ahadith, which are the doctrinal writings of Islam.\n\nSo, to my mind there are some significant differences between the Christian doctrine and the Islamic one.  I don\u0027t like either doctrine, but the Islamic doctrine is significantly more harmful.","And I do find both doctrines reprehensible, but not nearly in equal measure.\n\nIn Christianity Jesus overrides most of the nastiness from the Old Testament.  In Islam Mohammed positively asserts, defends and even performs nastiness from the Old Testament, plus he adds some of his own, like limb amputations (which, as far as I know, do not exist in the Old Testament, correct me if I am wrong).  Jesus stopped a stoning that was about to commence.  Mohammed would initiate the stonings rather than stop them.  I\u0027m just scratching the surface here.  There are lots of differences between Jesus and Mohammed.  Jesus preached to turn the other cheek and he practiced what he preached by allowing himself to be nailed to the cross.  Mohammed became a warlord later in his life.  Jesus didn\u0027t fuck anyone, as far as I know.  Mohammed fucked a 9 year old girl and he had many wives as well (I dislike polygamy too, but the 9 year old is unforgivable).  What a difference.\n\nI can\u0027t pretend that Islam is equally as bad as Christianity just to be politically correct on reddit.  I\u0027ve read enough of the Bible, Qur\u0027an and ahadith to know otherwise.","\u0026gt;Jesus did not change anything from the old testament\n\nNo, he did.  He definitely did change quite a few things.  I am well aware of the lines you are quoting too.  Do yourself a favor and look into it more.  He didn\u0027t change all of the Old Testament, but he certainly changes big chunks of it, and all changes for the better too.\n\nIf you compare personal conduct of Jesus and Mohammed, there is no ambiguity in my mind about who is morally superior.  I\u0027d be OK with someone trying to emulate Jesus, but I would definitely **not** be OK with anyone trying to emulate Mohammed.\n\nIt\u0027s definitely a great shame that Jesus didn\u0027t summarily cancel the Old Testament though.","\u0026gt;Counting the first, second, third, and modern crusades?\n\nI count doctrines first and foremost, and then I count how those doctrines influence the cultures adopting them second.\n\nSo yes, I am definitely counting the crusades (military adventures in the name of religion).  I count everything when I speak about Islam and Christianity here.","To the extent that is so, yes, definitely.  I would expect Christians to strongly and vocally oppose someone like Kony.  Similarly, when various Christian anti-gay bigots go to Uganda to proselytize, I\u0027d expect opposition from Christians.  Well, guess what?  I don\u0027t like Christians or Christianity.  It\u0027s just that Islam is worse, imo.  Ideally I don\u0027t want any Abrahamic religion to be practiced.  But if I had to pick either Christianity or Islam to be my neighboring doctrine of influence, I\u0027d pick Christianity over Islam any day.","I disagree with this analysis.  I know lots of areas that suffer from abject poverty which don\u0027t turn to any kind of fundamentalism.\n\nI also know fundamentalists which are more harmless the more hardcore they are: Jains.  The more fundamentalist a Jain is, the more harmless one is.","\u0026gt;If there were moderates would you hear them on FOX news ?\n\nHow about reddit?\n\n\u0026gt;Do Muslim moderates actively fit into the American narrative about Islam and its adherents ?\n\nBest way to find out is to talk to them yourself.  Seriously.  Internet is good for that.\n\n\u0026gt;Do you actively search for moderate Muslim opinions \n\nI mostly look at doctrinal writings, but I\u0027ve talked to Muslims a few times on reddit and offline.  I\u0027m not going to say they are all crazy lunatics, that\u0027s just false.  But plenty of times I talked to Muslims I walked away disappointed and sad.  They really don\u0027t say stuff I wish they would say.  And while I can see how they are aligning with the doctrine, in my mind I think, \"guys, don\u0027t you see how the doctrine is inadequate?\"  Of course once you become a true believer, and you accept that the doctrine is the word of the omniscient God, what chance is there to think critically about it?  So if you think I don\u0027t encounter this in a discussion with Muslims, you\u0027re wrong.\n\nAnyway, I don\u0027t really hate the individual Muslims, but I *am* concerned about the doctrine.  I worry that Muslims promote Islam without giving any thought to the impact the doctrine has on humanity.  I watched some conversion videos on youtube, and almost invariably the reason people convert to Islam is not because of the doctrine, but because of how good they feel about some Muslim friends on a personal level.  That\u0027s a serious concern because while these folks probably don\u0027t read all of Qur\u0027an, don\u0027t read ahadith, don\u0027t study Muslim history in all their gory details, may not know what \"Deobandi thinking\" is and so on, they decide it\u0027s a good idea to support and directly or indirectly help spread this dangerous doctrine just because they feel good about a person.  That\u0027s just unsound thinking.  If you\u0027re going to adopt a religion, nice community is a good thing for sure, but **do** check out the doctrine first and foremost, and try to understand what it is you are spreading.\n\nAlso people who hide the ugly side of the doctrine while putting out fuzzy feelings up-front are dishonest salesmen.  You know how lots of people get converted?  From Sufism.  And Sufis don\u0027t talk about amputating limbs.  They don\u0027t get on a podium and get angry like a lot of Muslim clerics.  They smile.  They are kind.  They talk about nice fuzzy mystical stuff.  They never mention the harsh side of Islam.  So... on one hand, as Muslims, Sufis are probably some of the better people.  But as salesmen for Islam, Sufis are the most dishonest salesmen.  They put forward the very best of Islam, and absolutely obscure or even deny the worst.  I can even see myself hanging out with a Sufi sheikh and enjoying it.  But I would never convert to Islam.  And I would lean over and whisper into the sheikh\u0027s ear, \"Don\u0027t convert anyone to Islam... just share your spiritual wisdom as is.\"  And thankfully I even know of some sheikhs who do exactly that, but not enough, imo.\n\nHow many Muslims say stuff like this, \"Converting to Islam is free, but if you ever de-convert, be careful, because a lot of Muslims believe that ideally you should be punished by death for apostasy!\"  If Muslims talked this way, I bet they\u0027d get a lot fewer converts.  That, and mentioning other similar things about Islamic doctrine, its often violent history and its often strict and intolerant culture would be an honest sales job at least.\n\nThing to remember is... while you may just want a bunch of cool buddies to hang with, someone else is going to read the doctrinal writings of Islam and actually take them both literally and seriously.  And then what?  What kind of world are we creating?","\u0026gt;You\u0027ve got to understand that most of that bullshit you see from extreme Muslims is cultural - not religious. \n\nSorry, I am in a firm disagreement with you here.\n\n\u0026gt;The regions where the muslim crazies come from didn\u0027t have the benefit of an age of reason\n\nWhy not?  Ever thought about it?\n\n\u0026gt;Religion is a part of it but it\u0027s not the whole picture..\n\nI agree.  But religion, sadly, is an important part of the whole picture.  Why so?  Because religious identity, sadly, is a very important kind of identity, still, for a lot of people.\n\n\u0026gt;Where are the Turkish suicide bombers?\n\nLet\u0027s wait.  Turkey is in the middle of Islamization.  Besides, Turkey\u0027s recent rulers have been militantly secularistic.  You can\u0027t give Turkey 100% credit for secularism that was not of their free will.  It\u0027s like giving USSR citizens credit for being atheistic at a time when atheism was a government mandate in USSR.

But there are other problems.  Islamic attitude toward women.  Islamic attitude toward dogs and liquor.  Islamic ideas about punishment (very brutal and cruel).  Islamic attitude toward non-Muslims.  Islamic attitude toward apostasy.  In other words, even in a Muslim society where people don\u0027t strap the suicide vests on, you can often see the negative influence of Islam.  And the more Muslims in one place the worse it usually goes.  Muslims are at their best when they are very dispersed in low numbers across the West.  But get a bunch of them together, especially in the Middle East, Africa or India, and bad shit happens.  Militarism is just one bad dimension of Islam.  That\u0027s the jihad dimension.  But Islam has plenty of bad dimensions besides militarism.\n\n\u0026gt;if you blame Islam you\u0027re going to have to label every single moderate Muslim a potential extremist\n\nModerate Muslims provide a comfortable and supportive atmosphere for the more serious Muslims.  They may not support extremism directly, but they support a Muslim who is marginally more serious.  Then the marginally more serious Muslims supports another marginally more serious Muslim.  And so on.  So at the end of the day, everyone plays a part in making Islam what it is.  Moderates make Islam what it is by their silence and apathy in the face of Islamic excesses.  Also, even moderates won\u0027t criticize the Qur\u0027an.  \\*sigh\\*\n\nI don\u0027t want to sit here and pretend Islamic doctrine is acceptable when it isn\u0027t.  I don\u0027t want to slaughter every Muslim or anything like that.  In fact I want the wars to end as much as possible.  However, I also think we need to speak out about Islam.

Can\u0027t we just get over that whole dragging the nation into an unwise war on false premises, getting half a million people needlessly killed, spending $3 trillion in borrowed money to pay for it, all to see the country in question right back where it was in 2002 thing already? ","Politifact\u0027s reading comprehension scores are dropping. Granderson\u0027s actual words were: \n\n\u0026gt;\"twice as many strikes (on) countries that are predominantly Muslim\" \n\nNot strikes on twice as many countries. They should be counting the number of strikes, not the number of countries. ","But you\u0027re ignoring piloted airstrikes. Neither Granderson nor Politifact seemed to be limiting themselves to drone strikes.","In other words: Bush authorized 46,700 airstrikes over 3 years, while Obama ordered 20,294 in 4 years.  \n\nAren\u0027t numbers fun? It\u0027s almost like you can twist them around in order to criticize anyone you disagree with.","\u0026gt; First off, if you\u0027re going to criticize someone with \"Aren\u0027t numbers fun?\" then say that Bush authorized 46,700 airstrikes, you might want to add his column again, and see that Bush authorized 56,651, not \"46,700.\"  \n\nI added up the numbers from the article you linked, which reads:\n\n\u0026gt;The U.S. dropped  17,500 bombs during its invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. It conducted  29,200 air strikes during the invasion of Iraq in 2003.   \n\nThat adds up to 46,700 airstrikes in the space of three years. The 56,651 figure includes subsequent operations until 2008-2009. You can see that the vast majority of Bush\u0027s airstrikes occurred during the two initial invasions of those two countries. \n\n\u0026gt;So, again, if you look at the numbers, and take the ~36,000 drone missions Obama has authorized, which you completely left out.  \n\nDo you have a source on that? It seems to directly contradict the source you gave before. The article you linked to clearly labels these numbers as air *strikes*, as opposed to air combat missions whether weapons were fired or not. I\u0027m just going by the link you provided; I don\u0027t claim to have any better data sources on this topic. Here\u0027s what your link has to say about drone strikes. \n\n\u0026gt;The Obama administration is responsible for  at least 18,274 air strikes in Afghanistan since 2009, including at least 1,160 by pilotless drones. The U.S. conducted at least 116 air strikes in Iraq in 2009 and about  1,460 of NATO\u0027s 7,700 strikes in Libya in 2011. While the U.S. military does not publish figures on \"secret\" air and drone strikes in other countries, press reports detail a five-fold increase over Bush\u0027s second term, with at least  303 strikes in Pakistan, 125 in Yemen and 16 in Somalia.  \n\nThat\u0027s 1,604 drone strikes by my count. Now I\u0027ll readily admit it sounds like a low number, and being classified and all it\u0027s probably hard to get an accurate count.... but unless I\u0027m missing something the article definitely doesn\u0027t say anything about 36,000 drone strikes. ","**110,937 � 121,227 Iraqi civilian deaths** from violence up to December 2012. Source: Iraq Body Count.

Source: United Nations. Based on data from morgues, hospitals, and municipal authorities across Iraq.  \n\nObama and Bush exactly the same, huh?","Actually, it does. You break somebody\u0027s government, disband the army and the police, and destroy civil order, then you are responsible for the disorder.","Well now that\u0027s some interesting reasoning. So if we don\u0027t launch a war to stop violence somewhere else in the world, then we are responsible for all of those deaths?  \n\nIn that case, how many deaths are we responsible for in Syria? In Ukraine? How many executions in China and Korea are blood on our hands? How about in Sri Lanka, Colombia, Mexico, Iran, Mali, Sierra Leone, Somalia etc.?","Well I wasn\u0027t aware that it was possible to exchange one life for another. In that case, I\u0027m sure the approximately 60,000 to 150,000 children under the age of 12 killed in American bombings of Japan will be delighted to hear that their deliberate targeting and incineration by US forces is \"ok\" since the Japanese Army was killing children in other countries.  \n\nThe firebombing of Dresden in February 1945 killed 5,000 to 10,000 infants, toddlers and school-age children, but as their bodies melted into the superheated asphalt streets, those children could take comfort from the fact that their deaths represented a fair exchange, since the government they happened to have been born under had killed many more children.  \n\nIt\u0027s okay that we deliberately targeted civilian areas and children for firestorm incendiary bombing, and it\u0027s okay that we deliberately tried to kill as many children as possible, because the Japanese and German governments had also deliberately killed children.

I\u0027m part of a group called Methodists for Social Action. We lobby, raise money, and protest in favor of things like the Dream Act, legalizing gay marriage, etc. I\u0027d wager that most of my fellow Christians in that particular organization are Democrats.","I get you.

It makes me feel alienated when fellow liberals assume that Christian must equal Conservative.\n\nAlso a liberal who grew up in Texas (still live here).","As a Democrat who owns several guns and enjoys shooting, I\u0027m curious about what your argument would be against gun control. I\u0027m personally all for assault weapons bans, for instance.\n\nEDIT: That\u0027s right, libertarian hive-mind...vote down anyone that disagrees with you even when they are trying to engage in intelligent debate.","Assault rifles typically:\n\n* have larger clips that hold more ammunition\n\n* have rounds capable of piercing police body-armor (yes, so do deer rifles, but deer rifles are a little less useful when trying to take down a line of police officers than an AR-15)\n\nI get that the average, uneducated person thinks that assault-weapon \u003d automatic weapon. I also get that uneducated people think that automatic weapons are already illegal - Mitt Romney said it during the 3rd debate, for instance. I further get that the use of the term \"assault weapon\" is purposely misused for political reasons. To say that it\u0027s a bullshit term, implying that they shouldn\u0027t be treated any differently than any other weapons is itself bullshit, though. They are definitely more dangerous in a mass shooting situation like the Aurora shootings or the attack on Gabrielle Giffords and they are also definitely more dangerous to police, which is why pro-gun people like myself support their ban.\n\nEDIT: I realize that this is Reddit karma suicide, since the prevailing social/political opinions on Reddit tend to turn toward survivalist, own as many badass guns as possible libertarianism. Enh.","Those are good points, though I\u0027d disagree that having a larger magazine doesn\u0027t make it more dangerous. Aside from the shotgun, the other weapons the Aurora shooter used were both high capacity weapons.\n\nAnd a .223 round can easily pierce armor. It\u0027s more about the grain than the caliber, which in the case of AR-15 is going to be pretty high most of the time (though not always). The reason that .223 rifles are sometimes banned for hunting is because they go through the animal without causing immediately lethal damage, causing the animal to then flee and possibly go off and die without being used by the hunter. This is a pretty different situation from a mass shooting spree.\n\nLet\u0027s be hypothetical. In the case of the Aurora shooting, what if the shooter had had a shotgun, a bolt-action 30.06 with a 6 round clip, and a .357 with a 6 round clip. Would he have been as deadly as he was in real life? I don\u0027t know...maybe, but it seems unlikely to me. ","\u0026gt;it malfunctioned after less than 30 rounds, which is the typical capacity of a normal magazine.\n\nIt\u0027s the typical capacity of a normal magazine for an assault weapon. If he had been armed with an average handgun or hunting rifle, it would be more like 6-10. That was my point.\n\n\u0026gt;In your hypothetical scenario, no he wouldn\u0027t have killed/injured as many people. But this is kind of besides the point since even under the old AWB he would have access to pretty much the exact same load out he actually did use. If you are using the example to advocate an even more extreme AWB, well, that\u0027s a whole new can of worms.\n\nThat is precisely what I was advocating yes, so I\u0027d say it\u0027s not beside the point. I never said that I support current AWB legislation - I said I support a ban on assault weapons. A ban, not a half-measure by liberal politicians to appease their base.\n\n\u0026gt;It just comes down to what you fundamentally believe. I didn\u0027t support the Patriot Act in reaction to 9/11, and I don\u0027t support assault weapon bans in reaction to shootings. I just don\u0027t like limiting the liberties that all normal law-abiding citizens enjoy just because of an isolated tragedy.\n\nI don\u0027t support limiting liberties in *reaction* to shootings, but in order to prevent them in the future. I also don\u0027t consider \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed\" to mean \"People can own as many and whatever kind of guns they want.\" It specifically says that the purpose to our right to bear arms is for maintaining a militia. State militias are no longer necessary (unless you mean the national guard, in which case their guns are supplied by the government), so the right to bear arms is not relevant. I\u0027m not personally for outlawing all guns because it\u0027s not practical and because they are fun and useful. But I don\u0027t think the 2nd Amendment any longer actually gives us that right and it certainly shouldn\u0027t be a catch-all to own your own military-grade arsenal just because you can.\n\nEDIT: But you make a very good argument. Upvotes for you, most definitely.\n\nEDIT2: Just in case anyone is wondering, I currently own and am very proficient with the following:\n\n* 1 .357 handgun, long-barrel\n\n* 2 30.06 deer rifles, bolt-action, scoped\n\n* 1 32.30, lever-action\n\n* 1 12 gauge shotgun, break action\n\n* 1 20 gauge shotgun, break action\n\nI also owned 4-10 shotguns in single and double barrel and a .22 rifle, but they were stolen while I was in college.\n\nSo, I\u0027m not against guns in general. I just 1) am against military-grade guns being legal, 2) don\u0027t think the 2nd Amendment is actually a valid defense of gun-ownership in the 21st century. I would say that gun-ownership is an implied right that is not guaranteed.","Damn...yes, thanks.","Lectured on this to my dual credit U.S. history class just the other day.

The issue is that a lot of Christians live in countries where secular law dominates, and in countries where it doesn\u0027t they behave just as badly.\n\nNone of this makes the claim that Islam is a peaceful religion or that Islamic extremists aren\u0027t a problem. Islamic countries are largely *not* secular and extremism will dominate in such environments. But it\u0027s not a problem that\u0027s unique to Islamic societies, and it\u0027s dishonest to suggest otherwise.","That\u0027s *precisely* the bullshit that prompted me to post this. Thank you for demonstrating the point.","Christians don\u0027t have the freedom to engage in violence the way Muslims do, and they\u0027re *not* happy about it. We\u0027re still fighting to preserve separation between church and state in the US, and that battle is happening in other countries like Canada as well.\n\nChristianity is no more peaceful or reformed than Islam. Do we need to guard against Muslim violence? Yes. Are Christians inherently more peaceful than Muslims? Demonstrably no. Mountains of evidence have been presented in the comments here.","Have you paid attention to the nations around the world that are explicitly Christian and not secular?

But motives matter.","Haven\u0027t heard that straw man argument all day.","Why should I not defend the rights of Muslims who have done nothing wrong? If Christians can be defended for non-violent practice of their beliefs, why shouldn\u0027t Muslims?\n\nYes, Muslims who engage in violence and oppression should be opposed, but they\u0027re hardly unique in that regard. That is the point.","So what? The point is not that Christians should be treated as worse threats than Muslims. The point is that focusing on *any* religious group as a greater threat than another is myopic. They\u0027re all a problem, and focusing on the \"great Islamic threat\" gives Christian activists the opportunity to return to power by offering to protect us from it. Given how many in the US are already Christian, they\u0027re likely to believe it.","Even better, don\u0027t give them the opportunity in the first place. Treat Muslims just as we treat Christians: entitled to believe and worship as they choose in private but *not* allowed to impose beliefs or worship on anyone else. That\u0027s not what we\u0027re doing, and it will not end well.","The people Obama responded to, who are all up in arms about him comparing Christianity\u0027s history of violence with the Muslim violence we see today.

Unionized workers can bargain for pay based on piece rate, seniority, credentials, profit sharing, individual contracts, effort, sacrifice,  etc.  You have too narrow a view of what a union can be.","Unions do whatever their members want them to do.

It means you can freeload and benefit from a union contract.  The union still has to pay all the administrative costs of the servicing the contract, but you don\u0027t have to pay for it.  It means unions are at a disadvantage in terms of funding, so unions tend to be weaker and pay tends to be lower in \"right to work\" (for less) states.\n\nIf \"non-right to work\" (for less) states allowed jobs to require union **membership**, not just payment of union fees, then unions would be in a much more powerful position.  It would mean that workers would have **job control**.  Their ability to control union initiation and expulsion would essentially give them hiring and firing power.  It would mean a true closed shop.  However, unions simply do not have that power anywhere in the US.","Why not look at Germany\u0027s highly unionized and successful auto industry?

You have the option of joining or paying the agency fee.  You cannot actually be required to join the union to keep your job.  Many people do not know that they legally have that option, so they just join.  Joining is generally a good idea because it means you can vote in union elections and help determine how your collective bargaining will go.  \n\nNonetheless the distinction between a true union shop and an agency shop is important.  In a real union shop, the workers have *job control*.  That means if they decide to kick you out of the union, say because you violated some union rule, you would also in effect be fired.  Union shops have more power.  They can punish workers for scabbing.  Agency shops don\u0027t give workers that kind of power.","Organizing is hard, but don\u0027t let reddit be your view of the American working class.

It\u0027s a crown corporation so it\u0027s not like it\u0027d go bankrupt... but still.\n\nLooking it up more, the previous 4 years, Canada Post was actually named as one of Canadas top 100 employers.  \n\n\n","And you also get in huge fucking shit if you do someone elses job... meaning in most cases, you can\u0027t even show people just how shitty of a job someone else is doing, because you\u0027ll just get a grievance filed.  \n\n","\u0026gt;Unions are necessary for every job. Are you a worker? Yes? Then you need a union.\n\nThat\u0027s not to say that unions are devoid of all criticism though and couldn\u0027t see improvements.  \n\nI unions having people run the unions that don\u0027t actually work for the company is a really bad idea.  \n\nAs KellyAnn also pointed out, seniority systems are terribly flawed as well. ","Please explain how \"merit\" is flawed, assuming no corruption and \"buddy\" stuff going on.  \n\n\u0026gt;Unions aren\u0027t infallible, but having them is vastly better than not having them\n\nI don\u0027t think I\u0027ve argued otherwise... but I do think some changes are required. ","\u0026gt;Never understood the union hate. Never understood people defending CEOs\u0027 huge salaries\n\nAre not mutually exclusive things. \n\nI think unions have a whole host of problems, but that\u0027s not to say that stuff surrounding how CEO\u0027s are paid is perfect. ","I\u0027m in one right now. \n","\u0026gt;A union is just two or more workers acting together to improve their own working conditions\n\n[O RLY?](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/000/015/orly.jpg)\n\n","And what do your friends do?  \n\nAnd regardless of what they do, I will say that minimum wage in the US is pathetically low and really should be changed.  ","What?  \n\nIf I\u0027m skilled enough that the company values my labor at $x, then I should be paid that much... regardless of union dues or not. ","Not at all.   \n\nI don\u0027t need a union to be able to tell my company \"The industry standard for my wage is X dollars an hour, and I\u0027m being paid X-3...\"  They can also figure out for themselves that if they want to replace me, they would have to hire someone that hasn\u0027t been working with the company for as long as I have, and would have to relearn everything, which would most surely result in lost revenue for them.  \n\nIt\u0027s entirely possible to negotiate for your own wage. ","Or if you are in a skilled (read: not easily replaceable) position and can actually negotiate your own pay (within reason). \n\nI think unions are a good idea, but they are not without problems.   Mandatory union membership is one of them... and the fact that because of such, you can\u0027t have a \"free market\" of unions, means that the unions can very easily negotiate what\u0027s best for the \"older\" people while selling out the new guys... and the new guys don\u0027t have a choice but to continue supporting them.  \n","\u0026gt;If you think your skills make you irreplaceable, then you\u0027re clinging to an outdated stereotype. Not all immigrants are uneducated.\n\nImplying that immigrants can have P.Eng\u0027s and have a stamp within Ontario.  Also implying that years of experience with a company are worth nothing and that anyone with the same degree will be exactly as proficient as someone who has been working with the company specific \"stuff\" for years.  \n\n\u0026gt;Expecting to receive the same compensation as dues paying union members without paying anything towards the negotiation process is actually the problem. I frequently hear people complain about being forced to join a union. Strangely enough, those same people never complain about receiving the same compensation package. They just want it for free.\n\nWho said anything about expecting to receive the same?  OBviously if you weren\u0027t in the union you\u0027d be forced to negotiate it for yourself... it may be more, it may be less, it depends on how valued you think you are.  \n","\u0026gt;they must also be free not to join them if they disagree with their policies\n\n\nI think this is something that would fix almost all problems with unions, especially if you consider the people who don\u0027t like one union, could form another union.  \n\nTo apply capitalism to the way unions work... they are a monopoly with completely static demand.  The people have to (or just really want to) keep their job, therefore they have to pay the one SINGLE union.   Said union is often run by people with tons of seniority who vote to increase or maintain their benefits while selling out new/younger/potentially new employees.  I\u0027ve seen situations where \"old union\" people are making like twice as much as \"new union\" people.   \n\nSome unions have become less about \"let\u0027s do what\u0027s best for all of us\" and are now more a collection of people saying \"I want what\u0027s best for me, fucking everyone else\".   \n\nObviously this problem didn\u0027t happen when unions were first introduced because everyone started as an equal, therefore what was best for you was also best for everyone else.  As unions aged and you started getting multiple different generations of workers within the union, problems started happening.  ","The biggest problems with unions is that they have mandatory membership, and there is no competition for that union. \n\nI as an employee, cannot say to my union \"I do not like the job you are doing, I\u0027m leaving\"... without actually quitting my job.   \n\nSo when my union arranged a contract that has everyone who hasn\u0027t been working at my company for more than 4 years prior, be getting a shittier deal, just so the people with \"seniority\" can get a better deal... then there is nothing I can do.    \n\nIf I was allowed to leave my union, and join a \"new workers\u0027 union that wasn\u0027t run by a bunch of old fucks who just wanted to get their own, then that \"old fucks\" union, would actually still have to keep my best interests in mind. \n\nI\u0027m not saying this is universal to all unions, but in some there is definitely http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority","Again: \"Tyranny of the majority\".  \n\n\nIt\u0027s not like I have veto power.  the small percentage of new people have no voice compared to the majority that have been there for near 10 years or more.   \n\nAnd yes, sooner or later, I will be older and have way more seniority... and when I do, I\u0027ll be making a fair amount less because the previous agreement had only new people getting reductions in benefits (benefits meaning everything ).

Reflecting on the violence of past does nothing to solve the violence that fundamental Islam is committing today.

I just think it intellectually misleading if one thinks that the events happening in Africa compares to the events happening due to radical Islam. The real issue that I\u0027m concerned is challenging religious ideology specifically the bad aspects, blasphemy laws, penalty for apostasy, atrocities against people who are gay, etc. Today, the vast majority carrying out the death penalty  for violating these religious rules or support this ideology are people who are subscribe to Islam.  With that being said the violence committed by Christians today also need to be reported and spoke out against as well regardless if it appears to be less prevalent. ","I\u0027m ignorant to the acts of The Lord\u0027s of Resistance. So I need to do additional research. Yes, i think scale is important which people seem to not acknowledge.  ","Yes yes, it\u0027s not only religion the cause violence. Agree, it\u0027s poverty, politics, lack of resources etc. What religious doctrine and this case Islam allows justifiable death sentences to be carried out. Insulting the prophet, blasphemy, death. Apostate, death. Infidel, death. Today a millions of Muslims either commit, support, or agree with this ideology and tens of thousands of people have died in the last 10 years.","Of course the doctrine of Christianity says the same thing. The large majority of modern day Christians especially in secular nations don\u0027t act on or actively support  those violent passages as millions of modern day Muslims do today.","Great comparison!  Christians in Africa are killing tens of thousands of gays and witches just like muslim fundies are killing tens of thousands of apostates, blasphemers, infidels, gays, witches and other muslims.","Laughable comparison! It\u0027s amazing people have to go to Uganda to identify something remotely comparable to the violence committed by people who believe, support or agree with Islam and sharia law. The sheer numbers are not even close.

Although because we know more today, have the ability to communicate around the world, command of resources, technology, etc. the process shouldn\u0027t take nearly as long.  Who am I kidding we are talking about humans where critical thinking, empathy, promoting health, happiness and well-being are still a rare tools utilized by the majority.","No one is pretending that Christians haven\u0027t committed violence... approximately how many people have died or killed in the name of Christ in the last 15 years due to abortion clinic bombings and African Christians killing homosexuals. ","Because the topic is not about violence in general.  It\u0027s specifically about violence conducted in the name of Islam which I think anyone could agree is a problem today. Yes other religion are committing atrocities but I think today the vast majority is being conducted in the name of Islam. ","Agree. Didn\u0027t mean to imply that it\u0027s only religion. ","So are you saying that the United States is dropping bombs, drones etc. is because the bible tells them so? The people of U.S have to drop bombs on people to protect, avenge, or defend Yahweh? They commit these acts of violence because they are commanded by their god and doctrine. I didn\u0027t mean to imply that people who are Christian don\u0027t commit violence. What I was saying that it appears that the acts of violence committed by muslims today are directly attributed to their doctrine(although I do acknowledge it\u0027s not ONLY doctrine) and commanded by god.  Of course you have to go to 3rd world countries for a comparison because  (how many gays and witches have been killed in the last 5 years BTW?) it\u0027s difficult to identify and compare any religious country or groups (1st world, secular based, modern) that has committed the atrocities of modern (within the last 10- 15 years) day fundamentalism Islam","Exactly!!!","Laughable comparison!

Even if all they did was sit in the Oval Office and wait out the clock, it would be far preferable to someone who thinks success is something to be resented, regulated, and punished.","And Obama\u0027s answer was Dodd Frank?  I have always seen him as far more in bed with Wall Street types than the Republicans.  I trust Romney or another Republican FAR more to understand and fix a lot of these problems.  That said, the entire 1% idea is based on the concept that being rich means you somehow \"cheated\" and deserve to be punished, when most of them are not investment bankers.","No, it shouldn\u0027t be based on income or wealth, but on how you acquired it.  I am all for going after the people at Fannie Mae and Goldman Sachs and the SEC who committed egregious acts, along with those who use lobbying in a corrupt fashion.  In my mind, it is no different than going after those who commit medicare fraud or tax evasion.  The argument should be framed as the people who play by the rules (be they a janitor making $18,000 or Mark Zuckerburg making millions) vs. those who don\u0027t (be they some poor person not reporting income under the table or an investment banker betting against his own customers).","I am a conservative with many conservative friends, but I don\u0027t know a single one who actually believes he is a Muslim, actively hates business, or is an actual communist.  A lot of times we just say that stuff because it gets liberals heads spinning.  However, there are a lot of serious policy issues that I really don\u0027t agree with him or the Democratic party on.  \n\nThe most obvious is energy policy, where he pushed hard for \"green\" energy while fighting oil, natural gas, and nuclear.  Also I think there has been a lot of fumbling in foreign policy (not that Bush was a huge winner), and I also think political considerations took precedence over prudent decisions.  \n\nObamacare is a monstrosity that seems to combine all the inefficiencies and high costs of socialized systems but without much of the benefits.  At a certain point, the political need to \"just pass something\" overwhelmed making the law a good one.\n\nI think he has been fiscally atrocious, and if he had his way, the deficit would be three or four times larger than it is currently.  His pivots to class warfare may get him votes, but it really hasn\u0027t done anything to actually solve problems.\n\nHis policy on immigration, which seems to be just not enforcing the laws at all, is something I am against.  I am actually very pro-immigration, but if you are going to have the laws then they should be either enforced or changed.  You don\u0027t get to pick and choose.\n\nI generally just get the impression that he is also not a very good leader.  Being able to make a good speech is nice, but if you look at his interactions with congress, his own party, and even the behavior of his own administration, you get the feeling that he really is in over his head.\n\nOh, he is also incredibly pro-union even though public sector unions have played a HUGE role in all the fiscal issues the states are having.  Not to mention preventing the educational system from moving past an early 20th century modality.  To be fair though, he has pushed for some good things in education.\n\nAnyways, I could go on all day and get into these in far more detail, but I just wanted to list a few for you.  If you are wondering, I voted for McCain in the last election anyways, though that was mostly because I thought Obama was woefully inexperienced.  I guess that is my biggest issue with him, he just seems inexperienced in business, leadership, foreign affairs, economics, and life in general.  That said, I do think he is a good family man who does honestly care for the people of this country, I just think he is misguided and inept.","Oil drilling is also at a record high, but both these things are either unrelated or in spite of Obama.","You \"forgot\" to include that most of the people being deported were caught during the Bush years","http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid\u003d20110704185843AA2l4uq\n\n","Actually, it was \"deemed\" to have passed.","I gave a lot of specific areas, and some were more just my general feelings.  The prudent decisions I was referring to was pulling out of Iraq and Afghanistan in order to satisfy the left rather than it being militarily sound.  Some troops should have been left in Iraq as facilitators and troops should stay in Afghanistan until the generals say it is time to leave, not whenever the next election comes around.  Also, the response to the Arab Spring seemed to greatly be based on waiting to see how popular opinion fell, rather than what was in our best interests.  Plus there has been serious souring of relationships with India and Britain (both of which were quietly built up by Bush).","As I posted above in the thread on immigration:\nBush went after illegals for being illegal, and mostly caught them in raids and deported them.  Illegals who committed crimes went to prison like any other criminal to serve their time.  Obama has greatly reduced these kinds of raids while greatly increasing how much criminals get deported rather than serve a prison sentence.  \n\nIn other words, Bush went after illegals and deported them, but made criminals do their time in the name of justice.  Instead, Obama doesn\u0027t go after illegals directly and instead prefers to deport criminals, lest they be forced to face justice.  Also, Bush pushed for Amnesty at one point, which is more than Obama has done.  \nHere is something from [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/20/us-obama-immigration-idUSTRE78J05720110920), which also basically explains my point.  \n\nI think Romney\u0027s repeated comments about eVerify is spot on as an easy and humane way to solve the problem and highlights his ability to come up with intelligent, reasonable solutions to difficult and politically charged issues.\n\nAs for Iraq, there were negotiations to stay in an oversight capacity (which was always intended) and the Obama administration dropped the ball.  We also did win in Iraq, though I will concede that Afghanistan we are not winning yet.\n\nAs for Britain, I was referring to a relationship at the State level, the so called \"special relationship\" which has gone by the wayside.  There were major demonstrations here in the US as well, but that didn\u0027t mean the majority of people didn\u0027t support the war effort.\n\nWith India, Bush pursued a huge level of engagement and was very popular for it.  Even the NY Times pointed to it as one of the few bright spots in his foreign policy.

It doesn\u0027t matter who came in after Bush. Our policy to subvert Assad would have been the same and ISIS would have still emerged. \n\nObama\u0027s hands aren\u0027t clean but he was handed a shit sandwich.","Being Muslim myself, I have absolutely zero problem reporting on suspicious activity. The only problem that I foresee is detecting it. If the San Bernardino attackers are any indication, then it\u0027s nearly impossible especially if the NSA missed it as well.\n\nThe other issue is that I believe there were only about one dozen or so such cases involving Muslims in domestic terrorism in the last decade or so, out of a US Muslim population of around 6,000,000. That makes it even harder. \n\nNevertheless our imams are doing what they can to raise awareness. It\u0027s become a weekly topic, which it should. \n\n","Well see that\u0027s a good point and all and I would do the same if it was my sibling. But your example relates to someone that you know. The assumption that you appear to be making is that all of us Muslims know each other and that\u0027s not the case. \n\nFor example, when I go to the mosque on Fridays, I only know about 15 people out of the 500 or so that show up. How am I to know that some young 16 year old that I see there but don\u0027t know personally is actually being brainwashed by ISIS on Facebook? It\u0027s not something that you can read in a person by appearance. \n\nAnd just becoming super religious isn\u0027t a sign. We have had extremely religious followers that simply died of old age over the years. I\u0027ve become far more religious myself but I would rather shoot myself before taking an innocent life. The other things that you mention can be normal as well and aren\u0027t really unique to Muslims. People cut off contact with other people, argue with each other, etc. all the time.\n\nWhat would raise red flags for us is people beginning to voice support for ISIS vocally or behavior similar to that. That\u0027s the kind of behavior that would make us bring attention to the matter. The obvious problem is that these kinds of individuals keep it to themselves until it\u0027s too late.\n\nHow many people could have predicted the Colorado PP clinic shooting by Robert Dear? How do you track and root out these people in general?","I\u0027m certainly not trying to defend the guy but rejecting Western culture is actually a common thing and not unique to Muslims. I know Asians that prefer to live according to their own customs here. A lot of first generation and even second generations have more sense of pride for their places of origin than the West. Even I was guilty of this myself for a time but I realized after a period of time that it was wrong. If I\u0027m living in the West, I should embrace it completely and I have. It\u0027s not illegal to do so otherwise but I do find it distasteful. I\u0027m not sure what race/ethnicity you are but it\u0027s only something an immigrant would understand. Some are quick to adapt, some take time, some never do. It\u0027s all normal.\n\nI am also thinking of gun ownership myself, but just something simple (like a Beretta 9mm) for the purposes of a hobby (gun range, shooting paper) and home defense. Our area has seen a few home invasion robberies as of late so that has me concerned. Again, not entirely a red flag and it can be kept a TOTAL secret from my extended family and friends. Even my own sibling that lives away from me would have no clue.\n\nWe would typically be aware to those people that are very vocal with their anti-Western sentiments. Even then, it\u0027s a needle in a haystack. How many domestic Muslim terrorists have there been in the last decade or two? One dozen or so? A common statistic that I\u0027ve seen on the internet puts the figure at 2-6% for domestic terrorists that were Muslim. \n\nWe wouldn\u0027t hesitate reporting them but the problem still is identifying them. I agree though that red flags do need to be expanded.","I remember that I had a difficult time with a Glock at the range. It felt too small and uncomfortable, whereas the Beretta was much more comfortable in my grip. It is helpful to know what you mentioned though; that the grip can be swapped out. I\u0027ll have to go back to the range and shoot from both.","No of course not.

Don\u0027t want to confront the demographic issues?  Then just keep for ourselves enough territory to ensure Jerusalem\u0027s safety and the neck\u0027s safety and leave the rest.  Let the Arabs have it, though they could have a much larger, better Palestinian state in East Palestine (aka Jordan) if the West didn\u0027t like the Hashemite kings so much.  Whatever.  We can always renegotiate later.\n\n\u0026gt;What is the motive that drives your Zionism?\n\nDo you mean my personal motive or rationale for Zionism?  I\u0027ll answer both questions.  My personal motivation comes from my self-identification as a Jew above all else.  As such, I want to live in a Jewish culture with other Jews, speak the Jewish language, etc.\n\nAs for historical rationale, I believe that although Zionism initially rose as a reaction to anti-Semitism, it is in fact the expression of the natural right of the Jewish people (indeed, of all peoples) to a free state of our own in our homeland.\n\n\u0026gt;How do you reconcile the right for a Jewish homeland with the rights of the ousted Palestinians\n\nTheir right is to live peacefully in a land they have a real right to.  When they wage an (admittedly the most pathetic ever) extermination campaign against Jews in our land, make every attempt to murder us simply for being who we are, where we belong, there is nothing to reconcile.  They don\u0027t have a right to make war upon us.\n\nNow, if you wish to speak on the so-called \"national rights\" of the Palestinian people, I\u0027d like to ask where those were, or any protest over them, before the Six Day War.\n\nGiven that the 1948 war seems to have created Palestinians as a distinct people when the other Arabs suddenly treated them like dirt to make them weapons against the Jews, I\u0027d like to see a two-state solution that would leave the Palestinian Arabs with a state of their own.  However, that right does not and cannot override the right of the Jews to our state.\n\n\u0026gt;Israeli government\u0027s policies towards the Palestinians in Gaza/West Bank\n\nThe occupation of the West Bank ought to end in most of the territories, with Israel holding onto just enough to guarantee safe passage through its \"neck\" region that links Northern Israel with Central and Southern Israel.  The siege on Gaza is a security necessity, and ought continue until it ceases being such.","Because we\u0027re not just a religion.

After they were kicked out by the Muslims, they returned in 1880 to a barren land, filled with swamps and Cholera.\n\nThe Jewish pioneers dried the swamps with imported Eucalyptus trees, and exterminated the Cholera and Malaria.\n\nThe land began to prosper. At around 1900, Arabs began pouring in to Israel, quickly overwhelming the Jews in population. They were usually working for the Jews as guards.\n\nSoon, the Arabs got greedy, and started revolts. Arab gangs soon assaulted Jewish towns, settlements and main roads.\n\nBy 1919 and 1923, the Arabs were lynching Jews on the streets.\n\nWhen Israel was declared in 1948, the Jews had only received roughly half of Israel for their state, and the rest went to the Arabs.\nObviously, the Arabs did not like this, and the 1948 independence war broke out. The country of Israel was a few days old, and it had to fight a war with 6 Arab nations.\n\nThe Israelis won, and took territory.\nSince then, there have been many wars, all started by Arabs.\n\nIn 1967, Egypt amassed a joint Syrian-Egyptian-Jordanian military force, banished all UN Peacekeepers, took out Israel\u0027s main water supply (Jordan river) and besieged Israeli sea routes.\nThe Arabs lost yet another war.\n\nBefore 1967, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank were Egyptian and Jordanian territories. They had lost those during the war that they themselves had started.\n\nThe Palestinians are only an official people since 1964, and were named \"Palestinians\" by Yasser Arafat, and an attempt to relate them to \"Palestine\", Israel\u0027s older name from 400AC to 1948.\n\n\nSo in truth, how could Israel steal Palestinian lands, when the Palestinians haven\u0027t even existed when Israel came to be? Also, the territory was taken during the 1967 war that the Arabs have broken out. The Palestinians are in effect Ex-Egyptians and Ex-Jordanians.","There were few Arab colonies in Israel in 1880 when the Jews got there. They were called Phalachim (plural), and they were basically a tribe of Syrian shepherds.\n\nYou\u0027re quoting a guy from 1907, but did you know that the Palestinians are actually Jordanians and Egyptians that were only an official people in 1964, when Yasser Arafat named them \"Palestinians\"?\nIn 1967, they were captured (unfortunately for Israel, since not Egypt and nor Jordan wanted them back) during the Six Day War in 1967?\n\nThe only Arabs who really have some sort of a claim on Israel is the Phalachim, and they\u0027re most likely extinct as far as the world is concerned.\n\nI\u0027ve studied Israeli-Palestinian history for over 11 years. I know what I\u0027m talking about. I also live in Israel.","No one living in 1907 could refer to Palestinians. That\u0027s my point. ","The existed in Egypt and Jordan. They were never a part of Israel. Those territories were taken by Israel in \u002767 during a war the Egypt had sparked.\n\nUntil \u002767, the Gaza Strip and West Bank were never even considered under Israeli jurisdiction. And believe me, Israel would LOVE to return those lands to Egypt and Jordan- but Egypt and Jordan don\u0027t want to take the trash.","It\u0027s no lie that Jews were a minority in 1945; try searching for a population map in 1880, when Israel was still infested with swamps, malaria, cholera and fever. Who cleared those up? The Phalachim (the real Arabs that were in Israel before the Jewish migration in 1880)?","Whatever the reasoning, facts are: the Palestinians have no claim on Israel; yet Israel is still able to compromise- but the Palestinians are just greedy and want way over the line.\n\nThe Palestinians don\u0027t really care about the \u002767 borders, you know that. They don\u0027t want Israel to exist at all, and are no willing to settle.","Oh right, and you, some guy in Europe who reads the newspaper now and then knows more than I do, right?","Man, I hear you. Really, no Israeli wants war.\nAsk any Israeli soldier, and he will tell you that he hates the army.\n\nBut you have to come to Israel and see what\u0027s really happening. Arabs are roaming the streets, in gangs, and lawlessly (the police can barely touch them). Every day, I read in the newspaper about another kid or two that got stabbed.\n\nI\u0027ve been attacked by Arabs 7 times already (most of it was when I was 16, I don\u0027t walk the streets anymore- now that I have a driving license). I\u0027ve never done anything to provoke them. It\u0027s horrible.\n\nAnd those are just the Palestinians in Israel.\n\nPalestinians from the Gaza Strip frequently try and invade us. They hide bombs in ambulances. Hell, my friend was an MP in the army in charge of and inspection post, and one day, he had to inspect a pregnant Palestinian woman before letting her in to use our hospitals. She started crying and screaming, but she had to be inspected. Guess what kind of baby it was?\n3 pipe bombs and a grenade.\n\nJust yesterday, 8 mortars hit the Israeli city of Ashkelon; but you guys never get to read about that. This constant mortar/missile barrage on Israel has been going on for years. Up to 10 rockets a day.\n\nIsrael is scapegoated to look like the oppressors, but we\u0027re actually really cool guys that got stuck living in the world\u0027s ass-hole; surrounded by people who religiously hate us. Tel Aviv looks like New York City, by the way.\nBut we\u0027re miserable here... We\u0027re being lynched and bombed and shot at. We\u0027re just doing what we have to do to protect ourselves.\n\nWe even disengaged Gaza Strip in 2005 fully (Gaza Strip is NOT an occupied territory anymore, contrary to popular belief; yet it still launches rockets at Israeli cities).\n\nCan we really have peace with this people? After getting attacked 7 times just for being a white Jewish male, you begin to lose hope.\nI was very anti-war and left-wing, before I nearly lost my life when Arabs attacked me in Natanya almost two years ago.\nMe and a friend managed to escape the lynch, and called the police (they saved our lives); we had 2 friends left behind, and they were beaten badly. The Arabs kicked them on the floor, spat on them, took their money and phones, and poured vodka into their eyes.\n\nWe Israelis just lost hope of peace... It will never happen... We still try, though, but to no avail, as you see..\n\nNot to mention that everything on the news is just half-truths turned against us. Israel was founded in 1948, while the Palestinians only exist since 1964 (originally Egyptians and Jordanians that lived in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, that were part of Egypt and Jordan before Israel, unfortunately for them, conquered it in the Six Day War that Egypt-Jordan-Syria- had waged against them and lost).\n\nThis is an Israeli\u0027s point of view... We don\u0027t see these on the news very often anymore, sadly... ","The problem is that there is zero trust in Palestinians. Every time we give them land or support, they use it against us. We gave them guns to protect themselves, those guns were used against IDF and Israeli citizens. We gave them all of Gaza Strip, they used the new territory to launch more rockets. There was no Wall separating Israel and Gaza Strip: the Intifada broke out and 20 Israeli citizens were killed a day.\n\nWhen Israel gives them a finger, they take the whole hand- and we\u0027re running out of hands. That\u0027s how we feel.\n\nWe even offered them genuine Israeli territory instead of our settlements; and they refused.\n\nIsrael does want peace. Maybe through obedience. Sadly, that seems to be the only thing Arabs understand.\n\nThe Arabs are fighting a RELIGIOUS war against us; that\u0027s the problem. And religious rage is impossible to calm..\n\nP.S.\nI don\u0027t believe I\u0027m short-sighted because of my 7 tackles with Arabs (in all of which I was defenseless and most of the time alone, against gangs of 10-30 people- who didn\u0027t even want my money; they just wanted to hurt me). These are the people we\u0027re up against. Arabs beat up Jews every day; so of course there has to be a generalization of sort.\n\nI\u0027m sorry, but they\u0027re genuinely bad people, who hate us religiously. I\u0027ve never seen an Israeli blow up a street in Stockholm, or a train in London, or the WTC; because they didn\u0027t agree with someone. It can\u0027t be helped. If we will give them everything they want, a new war will break against us:\nIf we win: it\u0027s this same conflict all over again.\nIf we lose: Jews are dealt with. Now it\u0027s time to conquer Europe.\n\nWhen the only resolution the Palestinians are willing to accept is 100% of Israeli territory, how can we solve this fairly?","Israel was invaded during the Intifadas (that\u0027s why the dreaded Wall was built); and in every war that was waged against us: \u002748, \u002767, \u002773, \u002706 etc.\n\nAlso, Israeli cities ARE bombed with white phosphorus (not that it will ever be reported in European news agencies). Some of the mortars that are launched at us daily are packed with this chemical agent.\n\nThey are not denied medical care, they\u0027re even allowed to use Israeli hospitals; but it takes time, because they need to go through inspection at the border- because of incidents like UN ambulances packed with ammunition, and Palestinian ladies \"pregnant\" with explosives.\n\nI am against the expansion of settlements, by the way. It\u0027s useless, and who wants that land, anyway? Yet as vain as it is- it\u0027s no reason to lynch Israel. I\u0027m against giving up existing settlements, though; instead, Israel is offering again and again a \"Transfer\" (we get to keep our settlements, and in return- we give the Palestinians back equal territory from Israeli land).\n\nWell, there\u0027s a difference between seeing something on Youtube, than it actually happening to you several times for no reason. As well as to nearly everyone I know. One of my friends was mugged in Tel Aviv by Arabs; they even took his clothes, and then stabbed him in the leg- so that he won\u0027t be able to chase them, or run to the police in time.\n\nI don\u0027t hate nobody religiously, since I\u0027m not religious at all... Hell, I even want to celebrate Christmas instead of our lousy Chanukkah once in a while; I really like the tree, longer vacation, and there are loads of presents! :-)\nI will admit, though, that I\u0027m a tad unfair in my generalizations sometimes, but that\u0027s because of the trauma I\u0027ve had as kid. Being beaten like that, helpless; laying on the floor, being spat on... No chance in Hell of fighting back.. Just because you\u0027re a white man/Jew that was on his way to the bus station to get home... And it happened to me 7 times... It\u0027s like getting raped 7 times by the same group of people.. I can\u0027t help but being suspicious..\n\nMy honest opinion, actually, is that the Jews, right as they are; should just say \"fuck it\"; pack our bags; and go live in the US or something.\nWe\u0027re 100% right on this conflict; but my grandfather always told me: \u0027being smart is more important than being right\u0027. I think we should be smart, and just leave this land to rot. No reason we should keep up with this religious war. They should have it, and kill each other over it like they always do, while we\u0027re having the life we deserve in a Western state..\n\nI\u0027m just a guy that could just as well be your neighbor, and smile at you every morning when we both leave the house for work; or invite you to BBQ in my yard. But I was unfortunate enough to be born in this forsaken land, surrounded by people who hate me because imaginary men told them so; so much, that they are willing to give their lives away- just to kill me when I\u0027m on the bus home.\n\nI wish the Jews never re-settled Israel. It would be best to all of us.","The reason they\u0027re not effective is because of Israel\u0027s competence. Every launch site is precision stroked, and armed forces on Israel\u0027s side of the border are keeping the insurgents away.\n\nAnd genocide? What genocide are you talking about? Do you even understand anything about the conflict? The only ones being killed are: terrorists, and people around terrorists.\n\nDon\u0027t want citizens to get hurt? Here\u0027s a few simple steps:\n\n1) Don\u0027t attack Israel, and they won\u0027t attack you (there hasn\u0027t been a single accord of Israel spontaneously attacking; it\u0027s always been in retaliation).\n2) Don\u0027t host terrorists in your house.\n3) If you are a terrorist, don\u0027t hide in a house full of citizens.\n\nViola.\nIsrael never had, and never would, attack without a reason.","And what about a deal with the Palestinians to not assault Israeli cities with mortar fire for 90 days?\nBy the way, in the end, Israel had agreed to Obama\u0027s freeze on building, but the Palestinians popped the negotiations for a generic, non memorable reason.\n\nIsrael can\u0027t agree to \u002767 borders, because we have thousands of Jews in the West Bank. In return, Israel had offered the Transfer; Israel keeps most of its settlements, and in return gives the Palestinian equal territory from Israeli land. They, of course, refused.\n\nSplit Jerusalem? It\u0027s pretty much split as it is. If you ask me, both Arabs and Israelis should evacuate that whole pile of rubble and glass it with bombs... It\u0027s been nothing but trouble for both sides.\n\nAnd let a few Palestinians to return? That\u0027s not how it works, buddy. They pretty much want every Arab/Muslim in the world to be able to return to \"Palestine\".

The Famous photo of Rumsfeld meeting Saddam in the 80s was when Rumsfeld told Saddam he didn\u0027t care about him killing the Kurds as long as he kept on fighting Iran for us. \n\nThe fact is that Iraq was actually a well-educated secular country before the US invaded. So yes, normal in many respects. ","I\u0027m not defending him, he was awful and any Iraqi will tell you that. However, Bush didn\u0027t make the claim that Iraqis were suffering under him present day; he said he had to be toppled because of his crimes in the 80s and 90s. That\u0027s what rings hollow to so many Iraqis; America did nothing when it happened and supported Saddam for it, and now pretended to care about the Kurds (who were safe since the no-fly zone installed in the 90s) etc. ","I feel like you\u0027re making excuses for Bush. I watched his speeches he made to the Iraqi people (the ones broadcast into Iraq before and during the invasion), and he promised them he would make life better for them. Many actually trusted him on this, and his failure to do so created massive animosity towards America among Iraqis. Bush tried for years to spin Iraq as doing better, and the more he lied about it the more Iraqis hated him. \n\nI remember once he was saying to reporters that he heard Baghdad had their power restored, which wasn\u0027t true. Pre-Saddam Iraq had public utilities working fine, but post-Saddam even the capital couldn\u0027t have electricity for more than 3 hours a day. Bush trying to pretend 4 hours of electricity being an improvement for Iraqis was viewed as a cruel joke by residents of Baghdad.","Talk to an Iraqi (or read an Iraqi blogger like Riverbend), I know a bunch and they\u0027d laugh at your characterization. They weren\u0027t allowed to criticize the government under Saddam, but they had the best healthcare in the Middle East, they had electricity and running water and a low crime rate.

Yes, it was dangerous to oppose the government, but they had a regular life of first world stuff like rock concerts and Internet access and running water and electricity and public safety that was completely ruined by the invasion. They had no al Qaeda before the invasion and no car bombings either. Your opinion is completely silly to any Iraqi, including those who wanted Saddam out. ","Yup. The Ba\u0027ath party was a secular albeit fascist dictatorship. Saddam Hussein was not religious and his government fought against the Iranian theocracy. Christians and Muslims were equally oppressed. ","No, the US cared about the invasion of Kuwait, hardly about the Kurds or shia. Once Saddam was kicked out of Iraq, they left him alone. George H. Bush told Iraqis to rise up and overthrow Saddam, and when the Shia did, Saddam massacred shia while the US stood at the border and watched it happen. The Shia expected the US to step in and help, since Bush\u0027s speech made it clear the US would do so, and felt betrayed. In 2003, Shias were cynical about the US and their motives since so many had been killed and the memory was still fresh.

Furthermore, if you find you agree, I would encourage you to go back afterward and ask yourself what the source of this information was, and whether other things you\u0027ve heard from that same source or similar sources need to be re-examined.\"  The idea is to shift the focus from whether it\u0027s good or bad to be a Muslim to the question of where one gets one\u0027s information and how reliable it is.","In that context, \"less than once percent\" means \"some number somewhat lower than 1%, but not remarkably lower\".\n\nIt\u0027s a matter of linguistic pragmatics, where the choice you make about which terms to use is as important as the denotation of the terms.\n\nCompare to the phrase \"a distance so short it can be expressed in millimeters\".  Well, of course, all distances *can* be expressed in millimeters.  The distance from the Earth to the Sun is about 150,000,000,000,000 millimeters.  However, millimeters aren\u0027t the most convenient unit to use here, which is the real point:  \"it can be expressed in millimeters\" is shorthand (and perhaps idiomatic) for \"it is convenient to express in millimeters\".\n\nIt\u0027s the same with \"less than one percent\".  In mathematical terms, it\u0027s a bare inequality.  In human language, it means that it\u0027s not only true that it\u0027s less than one percent, but it also means that that\u0027s the strongest statement that is convenient to make considering the information available and considering how concise you need to be.  The implicit assumption is that *if you could just as easily have made a stronger statement, you would have*.\n\nFor another example, consider the statement, \"I\u0027m hungry.\"  A mathematically equivalent statement is, \"I\u0027m hungry, and the sky is blue.\"  However, when it comes to human communication, these two statements are not equivalent.  If you said the former to a friend, they might ask, \"Want to grab some lunch?\".  But if you said the latter to a friend, they might resopnd, \"Huh?  What does that mean?\".  They know you\u0027re getting at something, but they don\u0027t know what.  Because human communication is made in a context, and what you choose to include and choose to leave out is important.  The assumption is that if there weren\u0027t something significant in your statement, you wouldn\u0027t be going to the trouble of making that statement.  Therefore, more or less, every part of that statement is there for a reason.","\u0026gt; Obama is the son of a Muslim\n\nNitpick:  Isn\u0027t he the son of a man *who was raised as a Muslim*?

This isn\u0027t to say that she provided me with no religious instruction. In her mind, a working knowledge of the world\u0027s great religions was a necessary part of any well-rounded education. In our household the Bible, the Koran, and the Bhagavad Gita sat on the shelf alongside books of Greek and Norse and African mythology. On Easter or Christmas Day my mother might drag me to church, just as she dragged me to the Buddhist temple, the chinese New Year celebration, the Shinto shrine, and ancient Hawaiian burial sites. But I was made to understand that such religious samplings required no sustained commitment on my part. Religion was an expression of human culture, she would explain, not its wellspring, just one of the many ways � and not necessarily the best way � that man attempted to control the unknowable and understand the deeper truths about our lives.\n\nSo I would say Barack was brought up with the sampler platter of religion.","\u0026gt; Islam is very different from Christianity.

Different groups interpret this differently.  Some subscribe to the idea of \"once saved, always saved\", which basically says that becoming a Christian is a one-time decision that you cannot reverse, and if you fall away, it\u0027s obviously very bad but it doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027re not a Christian anymore.

","Keep production strictly military and phase out civilian use.","\u0026gt; **USA:** \nThe United States is **by far the world�s largest arms trader**, accounting for around 30 per cent of conventional arms transfers in terms of value. Its position on the ATT is therefore key.\n\n\u0026gt;**Countries supplied:**\nThe USA supplies arms to **more than 170 countries** and has a mixed record of suspending arms supplies on human rights grounds. For example, it has restricted arms transfers to Myanmar, China, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in addition to countries subject to UN arms embargoes. However, it has supplied arms to other countries, for example Sri Lanka, Bahrain, Egypt and Yemen, where there is a substantial risk that they could be used to commit of facilitate serious human rights violations. \n\n\u0026gt;**Irresponsible transfers:** \nAs the main arms supplier to Egypt, the US authorized the sale of small arms, millions of rounds of ammunition and chemical agents for riot control, despite the security forces� violent crackdown on protesters. Yemen was also supplied with small arms, chemical agents and armoured vehicles, and Bahrain with small arms. It provides Colombia�s security forces with arms, military aid and training, despite their persistent violations of human rights. \n\n\u0026gt;**Stance on the ATT:** \nSince October 2009, when the Obama administration reversed previous opposition to an ATT, US support has been crucial in getting to the current negotiation stage. The US has said it wants the treaty to raise the international standard for export control of armaments as close as possible to that of the US. **However, the US position is weaker on human rights protection in the treaty than many of its allies.** For example, **US officials have not wanted to include obligations on states to prohibit transfers of arms even where there is credible evidence of their potential use for serious violations of human rights.** US officials have also argued against including ammunition under the scope of the treaty, claiming it is too sensitive and would pose technical problems of implementation. Overall, US officials would prefer a short loose document that spells out general principles to �take into account� rather than strong binding measures.\n\nhttp://www.amnesty.org/en/news/big-six-arms-exporters-2012-06-11","I like to think the military has stringent measures to ensure that its gun supplies don\u0027t leak into the civilian, and criminal, market.","Because water is designed only to kill people, right?","They can be used for many things, but they are designed for one thing.
