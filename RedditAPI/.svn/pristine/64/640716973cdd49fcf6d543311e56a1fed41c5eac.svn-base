Welcome to the "average voter".
Then think of the fact that the above statement is incorrect(averages can be skewed due to extreme highs or lows) and realize the irony of that statement.
Maybe I learned averages differently.  I learned mean(average), median, and mode.  
True.  I just got a kick out of it.  It's obvious what Carlin was getting at, and the commentary on it is more of nitpick.  
Considering that IQ is a very...controversial topic, no I don't believe I look bad, nor was I trying to make OP look bad either.
Are you sure the apathy didn't result in poor education?  
What public school did you go to?  That was exactly what it was when I was in school.  Teacher says X, and you repeat X on exam.  

That was most classes.
Nope, but my state regularly is in the top 10 in the nation for test scores, so I'm told they're decent.

I believe it's teacher quality that matters.  Very few encouraged that kind of discussion.  
I would bet my experience is probably closer to the norm than yours.
Yes.  Most were reiterating what the teacher or book said, in your own words.  
I'm not saying we didn't have to do that.  I was more hinting at critical thinking and challenging what you were told, versus simply some exercise in critical thinking.
Your use of negatives leads me to believe so.
&gt; Not an American so hopefully I can give a relatively unbiased opinion

Proceeds to give incredibly naive biased opinion.
Any number of reasons.  I don't like anyone's 2nd Amendment rights being violated, for starters.  Generally, this means voting for a Republican if that's a concern of yours(although on a state level it varies much more).
