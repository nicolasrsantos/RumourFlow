There are some studies which show the number higher.

My guess is that the number of muslims is roughly the same as the number of jews. Of course the latter has much bigger influence in how the nation is run.
It's interesting that you list sites biased towards jews.


&gt;I picked the first sites I found on google that had the data easily visible, using the exact same google query terms in both searches but replacing the words Muslim and Jew.

I am not saying you did it on purpose. I am simply stating the fact that all those sites are biased in favor of jews.

&gt;And you're saying wikipedia content is controlled by Jews? 

No I am saying it's heavily biased towards jews. There is no dispute about that.

&gt;Ooookay. Do you have a trustworthy source citation for this claim?

Yea. I cite wikipedia. Just look at it. Look at any article which deals with israel or jews. Hell take a look at how many articles there are about jews compared to articles about any other religion.

It's obvious to anybody who can read.


I know!.

How many generations of inbreeding does it take to produce somebody like that?
