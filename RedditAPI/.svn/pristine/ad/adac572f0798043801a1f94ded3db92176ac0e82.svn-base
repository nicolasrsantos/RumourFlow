One has to wonder what will all these people who have been brainwashed by the right to think that Obama is a terrorist loving Muslim do when Obama wins. Scary...
Hypocrisy in Christianity at its finest: An Obama bash thread in a Christian forum filled with racist, "Obama is a Muslim" slander. 
It's slander to call someone something they're not.
&gt;Does Barak Obama find it a defamation of his character to be called a Muslim? I doubt it. 

This is the USA and when you are running for POTUS, being called a muslim when you are not is definitely "untruthful oral (spoken) statement about a person that harms the person's reputation or standing in the community". Bottom line is people will not vote for him if they think he's muslim. Why do you think Fixed News keeps repeating his middle name? I'm not saying it's right, but that's the way it is right now. 

Anyway, thanks for the dictionary lesson. Hit me up if you need any chemistry help.


Dude, you need to chill out. Did you even read the first part of my sentence? I was only arguing that people are trying to mislead people into believing he is a Muslim. I was speaking in general, not just the forum posts. People are saying shit and they writing shit in order to propagate the myth, so both libel and slander is being used. Again, I am so sorry I misused the word. Go be a English Nazi somewhere else. Damn...
