Yes, but misinformation cuts both ways.  How many educated liberals believe a Koran was thrown in a toilet at Guantanamo Bay?
Yeah, I was thinking more about the "doesn't know the national anthem" part.

But misrepresenting Barack Obama is not much different than misrepresenting Guantanamo.  We're talking about trivial details of both.

Even if Obama were a Muslim or didn't know the national anthem, it doesn't have much of an impact on his ability to be President.  They are, in the grand scheme of who Obama is as a politician, pretty minor.

Also, not everyone views religion the same.  To some, religion is not a decision, but an inherited trait: Islam passed down from the father, Judaism passed down from the mother.  Absurd, yes.  Meaningless, yes.  But that's how some people see it, and they take it very seriously.
McCain touched a black baby?!  Jeezus!  I hope he washed his hands afterwards.
That wasn't what I got from the article.  What I got from the article was that the "I'm different from you" extends beyond race, and into nearly any category that differentiates one person from another.

The theme wasn't that the differentiation is covert racism, the theme was that intense attack campaigns cause people to form sides and not only distinguish opinion, but also distinguish nearly any other feature.

Exactly.  Hillary doesn't get to control his religious affiliation.  Obama is really the only one suited to make a comment on his religion.

People shouldn't even be asking Hillary this stuff.  It's retarded.
