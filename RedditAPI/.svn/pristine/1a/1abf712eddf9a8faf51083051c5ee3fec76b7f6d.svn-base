In no other western democracy would his religion even get mentioned.
You lost me. The Labour party? Popular party? Liberal party?

Even so, you've missed the point which is even if we knew, we wouldn't care, it wouldn't be news or an issue, and it wouldn't get mentioned.
Ok, so in one or 2 countries there is a party that has the word Christian in it. So what? What meaning are you ascribing to this? Are you suggesting they are overly religious or something? 

It's not like no-one would know the members were Christian if they were not in this party. In Europe, almost everyone is Christian in some sense, culturally at least. This is NOTHING like what being a Christian politician is in the US.
What **major** parties in France have a religion in their name?
I have no idea. But I don't understand how that's relevant to my simple question?
