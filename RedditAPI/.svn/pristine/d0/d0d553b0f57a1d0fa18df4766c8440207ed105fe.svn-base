While flying over the Gulf of Thailand, the transponder stopped, with absolutely no mayday signal or any signs of distress.  The plane just disappeared.  This has never happened before.  \n\nThere were two tickets purchased under stolen passports bought consecutively by the same guy, which led people to think this was a terrorist incident, but they currently have ruled that out.  While those passengers were flying illegally, they likely weren\u0027t terrorists.\n\nYesterday they revealed that the plane was likely spotted by radar *significantly* far away from where they were an hour previous, when it was last spotted.  If this is the plane (and from my understanding, they\u0027re pretty sure it is), this means that the plane turned almost 180 degrees and flew back *past* where it left, on the other side of Malaysia. \n\nEspecially frustrating is the fact that despite four or five days of searching, they *still* haven\u0027t found any sign of the plane, even though the plane disappeared in one of the busiest trade routes in the world (straits of malacca). There are also odd reports about people calling those on the plane and the calls getting through but no one answering, but I\u0027m not really giving that one much credence at all (I don\u0027t think most experts are).\n\nCurrent theories are that either a terrorist incident occurred, but had to happen *fast* (a large bomb, say), but no terrorist group has taken responsibility, and also doesn\u0027t account for the plane possibly being on the other side of the island, or that *numerous* systems with different safeguards all broke at once, which is very unlikely to happen (but isn\u0027t impossible)!    Or maybe a meteor hit it (I half-kid, but I suppose that\u0027s possible too?)\n\nIt\u0027s just a huge fucking mystery which is baffling experts.  Which is why it\u0027s so attractive to conspiracy theorists. \n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2014/03/11/world/asia/malaysia-airlines-flight-370-timeline/index.html?iid\u003darticle_sidebar  (also see the four scenarios link at the bottom).\n\n(sorry for the wall, I\u0027m hooked on this story.  I love a good mystery.  I only hope there were some survivors, even though that\u0027s increasingly very unlikely).
