We shouldn\u0027t ask people to fight under false pretenses when we are really doing it to support business interests. I think a volunteer military is appropriate for a free society, but perhaps mandatory military service for all (including the children of the rich) would make us more cautious about using our military for such aims.\n\nThe second Iraq war was entirely optional, and it was an option that should not have been taken. From a US centric point of view it could even have been palatable if it had let to a more secure economic future for the country, but it seems to have failed even in that goal. Things are worse for Iraq, and worse for the US because of this action. The only beneficiaries have been the recipients of government contracts related to the war. These same folks will benefit in the future from the further instability in the region. This is criminal.\n\nIt makes me sick to think of the lives wasted. The generous part of me wants to believe that the architects of that war really believed they were going to bring peace and democracy to Iraq, and that they believed manufacturing incorrect intelligence reports about WMDs was justified because of the good they would eventually do. However, the cynic in me wonders if they are all just a bunch of sociopaths who don\u0027t mind spending the lives of the American Military and Iraqi civilians for short term profits.\n\nFor my part, I apologize for not doing more to pressure my elected government not to participate in this folly.","duration":"","id":174,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_cu2wnbj","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":173,"links":[172],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"bambamcam","label":"You say imbecile, I say mislead.\n\nAt the age of wise 20 years old I voted for Bush in 2004, enlisted in the Marines in 2005, served twice in Iraq, and once in Afghnistan.

They said they\u0027d bring in the US, and Iraqi intelligence was aware of this as well. Very obvious though too. No country, randomly out of the blue, starts slant drilling, publicly declaring economic war, making childish insults (eg. \"we\u0027re going to make a woman in Baghdad worth 5 dinars\"), and overproducing past OPEC agreements.\n\nThe war was preceded by months of diplomacy, in which diplomatic resolutions agreed upon by other Arab states were, just as astonishingly, consistently rejected by Kuwait (as you said, \"Yet no compromises were made\"). It didn\u0027t help either the US told Iraq \"We don\u0027t care about Arab conflicts\" and \"It looks like Kuwait is attacking Iraq.\" \n\n\u0026gt;then instead of sign a deal and go back home with a few chips, he ignored the warnings and got totally assfucked.\n\nNot necessarily. He was a stubborn and prideful idiot but he didn\u0027t ignore any warnings. He wanted negotiations both on this issue (like what\u0027s going to happen when he leaves? Kuwait does the same stuff again?) and also the Palestinian question, and the US basically said \"Fuck you\" and went in guns blazing.\n\nMore importantly, this is assuming the US had no interest in attacking Iraq in some way or another. It was very interested in that. Iraq was a strong and influential nation that was hostile to US interests in the Mideast. It had to be done away with and this was the golden opportunity, and this has been in the US\u0027s interest since the 70s. No surprise that the US played both Iran and Iraq against each other, not taking any side, in the Iran-Iraq War. This combined with Khomeini\u0027s fanaticism to achieve what he believed was a holy conquest, kept the war going for a very long time and made it very costly, and the US was perfectly happy about it. Iraq is one of two countries in the Mideast I can say the US has legitimately hated, the other being Khomeini\u0027s Iran.\n\nThe true intentions of the US became very clear with the first full embargo in history, which wasn\u0027t hard to push considering the [ex]-USSR was in shambles and anarchy and China was not even a fraction as powerful or independent as it is today, an embargo which the US fought very hard to enforce worldwide for 12 years even despite UN and many nations\u0027 opposition just a couple years in, because it was pretty much genocide and caused a very grave economic, societal, and humanitarian disaster. The goal was to decimate the country, and if there was any doubt before the full embargo, this made it perfectly clear.\n\n\u0026gt;despite the country facing the brunt of the war with Iran which also shielded Kuwait\n\nThis may be an understatement. How many brave nations, including Iraq\u0027s allies, lended men against a struggle that concerned them as much as, if not more than, Iraq? None. Iraq did solicit its friends, and they were terrified of Khomeini, or in Hafez Al-Assad\u0027s case, even supported Iran. How many sent men to attack Iraq when the US threw billions of dollars at them? Quite a few in fact. However, the US was extremely furious with Jordan and threatened them for not also attacking Iraq.","duration":"","id":224,"color":"black","redditID":"t1_cu6jssx","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":223,"links":[222],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"IkmoIkmo","label":"Absolutely, wasn\u0027t surprising at all.

Between the Kuwaiti slant drilling of Iraqi oil, disinterest in waving part of Iraqi loans despite the country facing the brunt of the war with Iran which also shielded Kuwait, and the ramping up of oil sales that were together decimating the Iraqi economy which was at its military peak, it made all the sense in the world to find a resolution.

From an international law perspective, the intervention in Syria is quite like Clinton in Kosovo, which was said to be \"illegal but legitimate\". The fact is that international law has been awkward and rather neutered in this regard for multiple conflicts, so it would be very strange to just string up the Bush administration for it. I totally admit that international law is super complicated and it can allow for a variety of interesting positions, but 99% of the time that I hear a non-expert talk about it, they are making the same kind of naive, bizarre claim and singling out the Bush administration.\n\nEdit: I imagine the downvotes are coming for the legality paragraph.

Calm down.\n\nFurther, you\u0027re wrong. They came out of the Iraqi insurgency before the Syrian civil war. From wiki \"he group originated as Jama\u0027at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad in 1999, which pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda in 2004. The group participated in the Iraqi insurgency, which had followed the March 2003 invasion of Iraq by Western forces. In January 2006, it joined other Sunni insurgent groups to form the Mujahideen Shura Council, which proclaimed the formation of the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) in October 2006. After the Syrian Civil War began in March 2011, the ISI, under the leadership of al-Baghdadi, sent delegates into Syria in August 2011. These fighters named themselves Jabhat an-Nuṣrah li-Ahli ash-Shām—al-Nusra Front—and established a large presence in Sunni-majority areas of Syria, within the governorates of Ar-Raqqah, Idlib, Deir ez-Zor, and Aleppo.[42] In April 2013, al-Baghdadi announced the merger of the ISI with al-Nusra Front and that the name of the reunited group was now the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). However, Abu Mohammad al-Julani and Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leaders of al-Nusra and al-Qaeda respectively, rejected the merger. After an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda cut all ties with ISIL on 3 February 2014, citing its failure to consult and \"notorious intransigence\".[3][43] In Syria, the group has conducted ground attacks on both government forces and rebel factions in the Syrian Civil War. The group gained prominence after it drove Iraqi government forces out of key cities in western Iraq in an offensive initiated in early 2014. Iraq\u0027s territorial loss almost caused a collapse of the Iraqi government and prompted renewal of US military action in Iraq.[44]\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant","duration":"","id":444,"color":"purple","redditID":"t1_cu2ir4s","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":442,"links":[441],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"tpx187","label":"You have no idea what you are talking about.\n\n\nhttp://lmgtfy.com/?q\u003dWhere+did+Isis+start%3F+Please%2C+tell+me%2C+for+the+love+of+god%2C+where+did+Isis+start%2C+because+I+am+a+fucking+idiot.+There+is+no+way+that+ISIS+started+in+Syria+because+of+their+civil+war%2C+right%3F+How+fucking+dumb+am+I%3F\n","duration":"","id":442,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_cu2hptg","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":441,"links":[436],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"SnapMokies","label":"ISIS originated in Iraq.
