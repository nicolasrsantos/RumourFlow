Define "the church". 
Yeahhh.... that's not projecting at all. 
I don't think that's a fact buddy. 
Someone a couple posts down mentions how he has plenty of christian friends who are doctors and engineers among other things. I wouldn't exactly say those are the type of people to discard scientific reason. There's plenty of religious people out there who believe they go hand in hand! 
No need to resort to name calling and hostility when you're attempting to prove a point. :)
