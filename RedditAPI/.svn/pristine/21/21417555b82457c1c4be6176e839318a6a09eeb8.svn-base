When OP is saying the cats out of the bag they mean [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country).  The US is a nation that has so many firearms that a ban would do far more harm than good.  Those firearms won't just magically disappear overnight and a significant portion of what amounts to be over 270 million firearms would end up in the wrong hands.  Despite not being American, I'd rather see responsible citizens being able to carry and protect themselves because of this fact.   Other nations with *much* lower rates of firearms per person may see a benefit to gun control however.
...and a dickhead.
&gt;They seem to think 90% of gun sales will end up in the hands of gang bangers

Just like they will if their ever banned?
&gt;have larger clips that hold more ammunition

I'm sure you know this [but](http://abwehr-us.org/images/clip%2520vs%2520magazine%252002.jpg)...
