But on the other hand, since 1998 Iraq has been fundamentally disarmed: 90-95% of Iraq\u0027s weapons of mass destruction capacity has been verifiably eliminated ... We have to remember that this missing 5-10% doesn\u0027t necessarily constitute a threat ... It constitutes bits and pieces of a weapons program which in its totality doesn\u0027t amount to much, but which is still prohibited ... We can\u0027t give Iraq a clean bill of health, therefore we can\u0027t close the book on their weapons of mass destruction. But simultaneously, we can\u0027t reasonably talk about Iraqi non-compliance as representing a de-facto retention of a prohibited capacity worthy of war.\n\nRitter also argued that the WMDs Saddam had in his possession all those years ago, if retained, would have long since turned to harmless substances. He stated that Iraqi Sarin and tabun have a shelf life of approximately five years, VX lasts a bit longer (but not much longer), and finally he said botulinum toxin and liquid anthrax last about three years.\n\nTl;DR : Bush\u0027s government lied about the existence of WMDs, and lied in stating that the non-compliance of Iraq necessitated an invasion. There was simply no threat. \n\n\u0026gt; The invasion of Iraq was a good thing in these ways. Sadaam was a true representation of evil.

The Iraqi people wasn\u0027t yet ready for democracy since he hasn\u0027t claimed it himself, and hence the sectarian wars, the Shiite control of the state and everything we know. If the US waited, Irak would eventually be hit by the Arab spring in 2011 like Syria and Saddam would be toppled. But the US didn\u0027t learn their lesson and,for their own motives again, failed to really support the Syrian rebels (they refused giving them heavy weapons and thus many civilians died from aviation and artillery shelling with no real answer).

He might not have had direct ties to bin laden but was aiding other terrorist and war criminals in other ways. The war on terror was not just about bin laden but to all terrorist organizations.\n\nAre you actually serious ? Saddam\u0027s support for armed Palestinian movements against Israel in the 70s doesn\u0027t count. What is understood by terrorism in this context is Al-Qaida and its allies. Saddam was by no means an ally of Al-Qaida. Unless you\u0027re saying the United States should have invaded itself for supporting Osama Bin Laden in the Afghanistan War against the USSR...\n\n\u0026gt;As far as WMD, bush had conflicting reports as to whether they were there or not. Even if the reports leaned in the favor he did not presently own, there was evidence he had been trying to obtain WMD. Should we wait till he had obtained such to invade where he would surely use his obtained WMD in war? He also has the history of using WMD in war. He also stated in his trial, he did give the illusion to having WMD because he was worried if he didn\u0027t and it was known Iran would invade. He also I believe in 1998, not sure this exact year, refused to cooperate with having people come into the country to examine if he had WMD or not something he agreed to do in the early 90\u0027s.\n\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\nI\u0027m quoting Scott Ritter on this\n\n\u0026gt;There\u0027s no doubt Iraq hasn\u0027t fully complied with its disarmament obligations as set forth by the Security Council in its resolution. But on the other hand, since 1998 Iraq has been fundamentally disarmed: 90-95% of Iraq\u0027s weapons of mass destruction capacity has been verifiably eliminated ... We have to remember that this missing 5-10% doesn\u0027t necessarily constitute a threat ... It constitutes bits and pieces of a weapons program which in its totality doesn\u0027t amount to much, but which is still prohibited ... We can\u0027t give Iraq a clean bill of health, therefore we can\u0027t close the book on their weapons of mass destruction. But simultaneously, we can\u0027t reasonably talk about Iraqi non-compliance as representing a de-facto retention of a prohibited capacity worthy of war.\n\nRitter also argued that the WMDs Saddam had in his possession all those years ago, if retained, would have long since turned to harmless substances. He stated that Iraqi Sarin and tabun have a shelf life of approximately five years, VX lasts a bit longer (but not much longer), and finally he said botulinum toxin and liquid anthrax last about three years.\n\nTl;DR : Bush\u0027s government lied about the existence of WMDs, and lied in stating that the non-compliance of Iraq necessitated an invasion. There was simply no threat. \n\n\u0026gt; The invasion of Iraq was a good thing in these ways. Sadaam was a true representation of evil. All of his evils need not be explained one by one, but I think it\u0027s universally held he was evil and poison to the country he was ruling.\n\nInvasions are not the only way to eliminate evil. Educating people about democracy with no ulterior motive is.\n\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\n\nIraq was on its way to disarm the WMDs and Saddam was ready to do anything to lift the sanctions and get revenues from selling his oil. Maybe even becoming a pet dictator like the other Arabs. But no, the US took advantage of the post 9/11 climate and invaded for their own motives. The Iraqi people wasn\u0027t yet ready for democracy since he hasn\u0027t claimed it himself, and hence the sectarian wars, the Shiite control of the state and everything we know. If the US waited, Irak would eventually be hit by the Arab spring in 2011 like Syria and Saddam would be toppled. But the US didn\u0027t learn their lesson and,for their own motives again, failed to really support the Syrian rebels (they refused giving them heavy weapons and thus many civilians died from aviation and artillery shelling with no real answer). Hence civil war and no democracy and Syria, just as it is now in Iraq (domination from Irani proxies).","duration":"","id":42,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_cskeaav","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":37,"links":[36],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"maddlabber829","label":"Isis doesn\u0027t have control over a country.

Two very large groups people are going to do everything up to and including giving their own lives in pursuit of opposing goals.  So when do you do something so insanely costly?  The answer has to be almost never.  Only when there is an emergency so compelling, and *hope is so lost for solving it any other way*, that it is worth the harm of a hellish amount of human suffering.\n\nSo let\u0027s deal with the basic theoretical situation: There\u0027s a cruel dictator somewhere, there\u0027s some sort of evidence he has or wants weapons of mass destruction, inspections are ongoing but there are reports of non-cooperation.  That\u0027s a very rosy view of the case for war, but let\u0027s start there, because that\u0027s the point of view the media parroted from the government before the war started.  \n\nHave we reached the \"when\" set out above?  When there is some threat of some unknown, nonspecific WMDs that are not being used or threatened to be used yet, have we reached a crisis that may only be solved by raining the fires of hell down upon mankind right now?  When there are terrorists and war criminals escaping justice somewhere in the world, is our only choice to sacrifice hundreds of thousands of people to death and dismemberment immediately?\n\nPoint is, a justification is not a justification to do *anything*.  If someone jaywalks in front of you, you should still try to avoid hitting them even if you have a right to honk.  And if a guy who has no business being in charge of a country is nevertheless in charge of a country somewhere, you can pass UN resolutions and sanctions and complain, but that doesn\u0027t mean you can just throw as much death and destruction at the problem as you want.","duration":"","id":48,"color":"blue","redditID":"t1_csk7jef","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":0,"links":[],"score":4.0,"level":5,"title":"CMV: The invasion of Iraq was the right thing to do.","label":"maddlabber829","duration":"","id":0,"color":"red","redditID":"t3_3b8xrx","isTrueCluster":"true","timestamp":1.435388042E9,"simScore":0.0,"sentiment":"N/A"},"timestamp":1.435407059E9,"simScore":0.7900283126213593,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},"timestamp":1.435407617E9,"simScore":0.6315639171291554,"sentiment":"  Neutral"},{"index":50,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"weebs86","label":"Bush was a horrible person to be in power.

The reports about trying to get uranium was controversial and want the refined type of uranium for use in weapons anyways, and would only be used for nuclear power.\n\nIf the basis for full ground war is attacking your own citizens then the bar is low.
