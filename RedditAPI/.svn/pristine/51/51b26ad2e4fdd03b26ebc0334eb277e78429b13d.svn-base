Maybe \u0027fucking terrifying\u0027:\n\nSometimes there will be some stupid goddamn article from an extreme-spin opinion blog, with a title even more sensationalized than the original, making this or that claim.  A claim that, it turns out, is verifiable as factually false (or something close to it).\n\nAnd, sometimes, the very top comment will be some clear refutation of the title and the linked material, along with an eloquent appeal along the lines of \"Guys, look, I realize we\u0027re all very strongly opposed to *Blah*, and very supportive of *Bleh*, but we can\u0027t go the way of Fox News and just disregard the facts completely.  This is very clearly false, and we should not be spreading it.\"\n\nAnd then we all applaud, and say \"Ha, see, look - Reddit hasn\u0027t gone off the crazy end, because as a community we actually check up on this shit.

Seems that the cable is openly acknowledging that the French recognize what Defense Minister Barak said is B.S.)\n\nAnyway, I was expecting this thread to be more of a circle jerk, so I have to say I\u0027m pleasantly surprised to see this thread at the top - actual research and discussion of the cable contents themselves, rather than taking the word of a sensationalist blog. I\u0027m glad to see my faith in Reddit redeemed.","duration":"","id":34,"color":"lightblue","redditID":"t1_c19yiwi","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":2,"links":[1],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"coelomate","label":"Exactly.

Seriously, what\u0027s simple is the mind of the Zionist who finds that in the end all he has is the \"doctrine\" that might makes right.   Losers are losers.  They have no right to complain!   At least not in my court of law!  When to think, how recent it was, when the Jews whom the Zionists claim to represent, were on the losing side, and what happened to them?  And what could you say about it?   Nothing.  This assumes, of course, that logical consistency is held to be a virtue.  I am not sure you would agree.\n\n\u0026gt;If you want to blame someone for the plight of those living in the aforementioned territories, then blame those arab nations.\n\nUh huh.

After they were kicked out by the Muslims, they returned in 1880 to a barren land, filled with swamps and Cholera.\n\nThe Jewish pioneers dried the swamps with imported Eucalyptus trees, and exterminated the Cholera and Malaria.\n\nThe land began to prosper. At around 1900, Arabs began pouring in to Israel, quickly overwhelming the Jews in population. They were usually working for the Jews as guards.\n\nSoon, the Arabs got greedy, and started revolts. Arab gangs soon assaulted Jewish towns, settlements and main roads.\n\nBy 1919 and 1923, the Arabs were lynching Jews on the streets.\n\nWhen Israel was declared in 1948, the Jews had only received roughly half of Israel for their state, and the rest went to the Arabs.\nObviously, the Arabs did not like this, and the 1948 independence war broke out. The country of Israel was a few days old, and it had to fight a war with 6 Arab nations.\n\nThe Israelis won, and took territory.\nSince then, there have been many wars, all started by Arabs.\n\nIn 1967, Egypt amassed a joint Syrian-Egyptian-Jordanian military force, banished all UN Peacekeepers, took out Israel\u0027s main water supply (Jordan river) and besieged Israeli sea routes.\nThe Arabs lost yet another war.\n\nBefore 1967, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank were Egyptian and Jordanian territories. They had lost those during the war that they themselves had started.\n\nThe Palestinians are only an official people since 1964, and were named \"Palestinians\" by Yasser Arafat, and an attempt to relate them to \"Palestine\", Israel\u0027s older name from 400AC to 1948.\n\n\nSo in truth, how could Israel steal Palestinian lands, when the Palestinians haven\u0027t even existed when Israel came to be?

The country of Israel was a few days old, and it had to fight a war with 6 Arab nations.\n\nThe Israelis won, and took territory.\nSince then, there have been many wars, all started by Arabs.\n\nIn 1967, Egypt amassed a joint Syrian-Egyptian-Jordanian military force, banished all UN Peacekeepers, took out Israel\u0027s main water supply (Jordan river) and besieged Israeli sea routes.\nThe Arabs lost yet another war.\n\nBefore 1967, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank were Egyptian and Jordanian territories. They had lost those during the war that they themselves had started.\n\nThe Palestinians are only an official people since 1964, and were named \"Palestinians\" by Yasser Arafat, and an attempt to relate them to \"Palestine\", Israel\u0027s older name from 400AC to 1948.\n\n\nSo in truth, how could Israel steal Palestinian lands, when the Palestinians haven\u0027t even existed when Israel came to be? Also, the territory was taken during the 1967 war that the Arabs have broken out. The Palestinians are in effect Ex-Egyptians and Ex-Jordanians.","duration":"","id":113,"color":"green","redditID":"t1_c19yp01","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":100,"links":[0],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"darkwingduckdunn","label":"Ya know, I have no problem with Jewish people for their faith, that assertion is just plain dumb.

Really, no Israeli wants war.\nAsk any Israeli soldier, and he will tell you that he hates the army.\n\nBut you have to come to Israel and see what\u0027s really happening. Arabs are roaming the streets, in gangs, and lawlessly (the police can barely touch them). Every day, I read in the newspaper about another kid or two that got stabbed.\n\nI\u0027ve been attacked by Arabs 7 times already (most of it was when I was 16, I don\u0027t walk the streets anymore- now that I have a driving license). I\u0027ve never done anything to provoke them. It\u0027s horrible.\n\nAnd those are just the Palestinians in Israel.\n\nPalestinians from the Gaza Strip frequently try and invade us. They hide bombs in ambulances. Hell, my friend was an MP in the army in charge of and inspection post, and one day, he had to inspect a pregnant Palestinian woman before letting her in to use our hospitals. She started crying and screaming, but she had to be inspected. Guess what kind of baby it was?\n3 pipe bombs and a grenade.\n\nJust yesterday, 8 mortars hit the Israeli city of Ashkelon; but you guys never get to read about that. This constant mortar/missile barrage on Israel has been going on for years. Up to 10 rockets a day.\n\nIsrael is scapegoated to look like the oppressors, but we\u0027re actually really cool guys that got stuck living in the world\u0027s ass-hole; surrounded by people who religiously hate us. Tel Aviv looks like New York City, by the way.\nBut we\u0027re miserable here... We\u0027re being lynched and bombed and shot at. We\u0027re just doing what we have to do to protect ourselves.\n\nWe even disengaged Gaza Strip in 2005 fully (Gaza Strip is NOT an occupied territory anymore, contrary to popular belief; yet it still launches rockets at Israeli cities).\n\nCan we really have peace with this people? After getting attacked 7 times just for being a white Jewish male, you begin to lose hope.\nI was very anti-war and left-wing, before I nearly lost my life when Arabs attacked me in Natanya almost two years ago.\nMe and a friend managed to escape the lynch, and called the police (they saved our lives); we had 2 friends left behind, and they were beaten badly. The Arabs kicked them on the floor, spat on them, took their money and phones, and poured vodka into their eyes.\n\nWe Israelis just lost hope of peace... It will never happen... We still try, though, but to no avail, as you see..\n\nNot to mention that everything on the news is just half-truths turned against us. Israel was founded in 1948, while the Palestinians only exist since 1964 (originally Egyptians and Jordanians that lived in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, that were part of Egypt and Jordan before Israel, unfortunately for them, conquered it in the Six Day War that Egypt-Jordan-Syria- had waged against them and lost).\n\nThis is an Israeli\u0027s point of view...

After they were kicked out by the Muslims, they returned in 1880 to a barren land, filled with swamps and Cholera.\n\nThe Jewish pioneers dried the swamps with imported Eucalyptus trees, and exterminated the Cholera and Malaria.\n\nThe land began to prosper. At around 1900, Arabs began pouring in to Israel, quickly overwhelming the Jews in population. They were usually working for the Jews as guards.\n\nSoon, the Arabs got greedy, and started revolts. Arab gangs soon assaulted Jewish towns, settlements and main roads.\n\nBy 1919 and 1923, the Arabs were lynching Jews on the streets.\n\nWhen Israel was declared in 1948, the Jews had only received roughly half of Israel for their state, and the rest went to the Arabs.\nObviously, the Arabs did not like this, and the 1948 independence war broke out. The country of Israel was a few days old, and it had to fight a war with 6 Arab nations.\n\nThe Israelis won, and took territory.\nSince then, there have been many wars, all started by Arabs.\n\nIn 1967, Egypt amassed a joint Syrian-Egyptian-Jordanian military force, banished all UN Peacekeepers, took out Israel\u0027s main water supply (Jordan river) and besieged Israeli sea routes.\nThe Arabs lost yet another war.\n\nBefore 1967, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank were Egyptian and Jordanian territories. They had lost those during the war that they themselves had started.\n\nThe Palestinians are only an official people since 1964, and were named \"Palestinians\" by Yasser Arafat, and an attempt to relate them to \"Palestine\", Israel\u0027s older name from 400AC to 1948.\n\n\nSo in truth, how could Israel steal Palestinian lands, when the Palestinians haven\u0027t even existed when Israel came to be? Also, the territory was taken during the 1967 war that the Arabs have broken out.
