Of course, non-christians (like me) and more tolerant christians (my friends and parents to an extent) point out that this **shouldn\u0027t** be a smear attempt as this is insulting to evedy muslim, but even if he was and told us, he\u0027d still be president as the constitution allows people of any religion to do so.\n\nWhen people point out he\u0027s not acting like a Muslim, they cite taqiyya and that hes allowed to hide his faith to decieve the enemy/expand islam. (Guessing that\u0027s a lie)\n\nThen there are the conspiracy theories that Obama is implementing Sharia to America and that\u0027s why they don\u0027t want him to be a Muslim, because obviously the entire government is Muslim and won\u0027t admit it even though they run the country.
