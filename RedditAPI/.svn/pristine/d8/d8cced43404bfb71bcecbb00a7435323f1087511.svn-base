There are no facts to suggest that Obama is a Muslim aside from his name (obviously a specious argument, but I\u0027m pretty sure that\u0027s why most people think he\u0027s Muslim). However there are facts to suggest that Islam and its followers are to be feared. 13% of Muslim **Americans** believe suicide bombings are justified [(source)](http://pewresearch.org/assets/pdf/muslim-americans.pdf#page\u003d60). These are people in a country where Muslim extremism is almost non existent in comparison to its prevalence in other countries, yet a very significant portion of them think blowing yourself up to ensure the deaths of innocent people is a reasonable thing to do (26% of Muslims under 30 thought suicide bombings are justified, so this is not a mentality that appears to be waning). In France, 35% of Muslims feel suicide bombings are justified. OVER A THIRD OF ALL MUSLIMS IN FRANCE THINK SUICIDE BOMBINGS ARE JUSTIFIED. I\u0027m sorry for going all caps lock kooky on you but the magnitude of that statistic cannot be understated.\n\nThere is also the issue of apostasy. In many Islamic countries the renunciation of Islam or the declaration of atheistic view points carries a death penalty. You disagree with Islam? Fine, then the punishment is death. I personally think that is a very bad thing. And we\u0027re not talking about extremist groups here. We are talking about the laws of sovereign nations.\n\nI am not a Islamaphobe. I won\u0027t discriminate against someone because they practice Islam, but I do become somewhat wary of them because these radical view points are far more pervasive in Islam than people are willing to admit.\n","duration":"","id":11,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_c6y1t7z","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":3,"links":[2],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"yourdadsbff","label":"These people also believe that being a Muslim is a bad thing, which is even sadder.

These are people in a country where Muslim extremism is almost non existent in comparison to its prevalence in other countries, yet a very significant portion of them think blowing yourself up to ensure the deaths of innocent people is a reasonable thing to do (26% of Muslims under 30 thought suicide bombings are justified, so this is not a mentality that appears to be waning). In France, 35% of Muslims feel suicide bombings are justified. OVER A THIRD OF ALL MUSLIMS IN FRANCE THINK SUICIDE BOMBINGS ARE JUSTIFIED. I\u0027m sorry for going all caps lock kooky on you but the magnitude of that statistic cannot be understated.\n\nThere is also the issue of apostasy. In many Islamic countries the renunciation of Islam or the declaration of atheistic view points carries a death penalty. You disagree with Islam? Fine, then the punishment is death. I personally think that is a very bad thing. And we\u0027re not talking about extremist groups here. We are talking about the laws of sovereign nations.\n\nI am not a Islamaphobe. I won\u0027t discriminate against someone because they practice Islam, but I do become somewhat wary of them because these radical view points are far more pervasive in Islam than people are willing to admit.\n","duration":"","id":11,"color":"grey","redditID":"t1_c6y1t7z","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":3,"links":[2],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"yourdadsbff","label":"These people also believe that being a Muslim is a bad thing, which is even sadder.
