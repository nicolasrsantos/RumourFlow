This is how it was understood to mean in the time of the Founding Fathers, and had been already settled in English law well before the Constitution was written.

Let me toss out one of multiple arguments:\n\nI would rather cut short a life that hasn\u0027t begun living\\* than bring that life into a family that doesn\u0027t want it, won\u0027t properly care for it and likely abuse it.\n\nYou can talk about the option of adoption all you want, but far too many unwanted children stay with their birth parents and are raised in an environment rife with resentment, anger and abuse. No child should have to endure that, and such upbringings often produce unstable adults who are predisposed towards the same types of behaviors.\n\nAnd on a tangentially related note, suppose abortion is outlawed. How would you feel about government support programs to give financial aid to people burdened with children they cannot afford and would have chosen to abort if given that choice? Please avoid, for now, the subject of the abuse of the system. It\u0027s fairly common for pro-lifers to care ever so much about preserving a fetus but turn around and be staunchly against offering support once that fetus leaves the womb, and cries of drug addicts and welfare queens abusing the system are inevitably brought out as a justification-slash-deflection. I can respect if that\u0027s a concern, but I would like to see a well-reasoned argument that does not rely solely on that premise.\n\n\\* Let\u0027s skip the \"when life begins\" debate for now. Whatever the potential human experiences in the womb during the first trimester (that being the most common abortion window) is not qualitative life experience. Life, by some definitions may begin before birth, but such a life has not truly *lived*.\n\n\u0026gt;Supporting the vicious slaughter of babies just because they were conceived incorrectly is no different to supporting the elimination of an entire race, because said race is statistically likely to be unemployed or a criminal.\n\nHoly cunting Christ, no. Firstly, \"vicious\" is not an adjective applicable to modern abortions. They\u0027re not done in back alleys with coat hangers, for fuck\u0027s sake. Secondly, genocide destroys people who are already *people*. They\u0027re living, breathing, sentient beings with feelings and memories and knowledge. A fetus doesn\u0027t have those things. There is a non-trivial likelihood that any given fetus will die before it does. A fetus is nothing but potential. And yes, cutting loose that potential before it can manifest isn\u0027t great. Lost potential will always be tragic, but I consider the murder of an actual *person* to be a much greater crime.\n\nA fetus has no concept of it\u0027s own existence as an individual. It cannot understand life, much less the value of it\u0027s own life. What, then, is death to a fetus? Should we not feel more compassion for the lives that will experience terror and dread and loss and regret?\n\nDon\u0027t you dare compare the death of a fetus to an actual person. They are *incomparable*.","duration":"","id":62,"color":"brown","redditID":"t1_cv6owta","isTrueCluster":"true","parentID":{"index":61,"links":[59],"score":5.0,"level":5,"title":"Masturbateur","label":"And so we should murder children?

Even vasectomies can spontaneously reverse. People who use these methi Why punish those who made every effort to avoid being put in this situation? \n\n\u0026gt;you favor the killing of what is effectively a human being\n\nNo, I don\u0027t. I just spent a couple paragraphs explaining that I do not equate the life of a fetus to that of a grown human. Given the choice between the two (and assuming the grown human isn\u0027t a heinous criminal or otherwise horrible), I would choose to kill the fetus *every time*. The value of that \"life\" is, as I said above, *incomparable* to that of a grown (or growing!) human.\n\n\u0026gt;At what stage do you believe that life begins? the third trimester? Maybe the moment that the baby\u0027s head emerges from the womb? Or maybe it\u0027s not until the baby takes its\u0027 first steps?\n\nLife is a difficult term to define. The best metrics I\u0027ve seen for defining life are A) self-sustainability, the point at which it can survive outside the womb and B) the start of brain activity (chosen because death, or the lack of life, is defined as the cessation of brain activity).\n\nIn either case this brings us to a few weeks ranging from the end of the second trimester to the beginning of the third.\n\nInterestingly, Christianity traditionally defines life as beginning at the moment of ensoulment, which happens when the child first draws breath. And, again traditionally, they didn\u0027t consider a fetus a potential human until it\u0027s first movement was felt by the mother. Today\u0027s Christian pro-lifers have come a long way. \n\n\u0026gt;A three year old \"has no concept of it\u0027s own existence as an individual. It cannot understand life, much less the value of it\u0027s own life.\" So what is death to a three year old?\n\nFun fact, humans begin to understand their own existence as an individual around *two* years of age. That aside, what I said was that \"Should we not feel more compassion for the lives that will experience terror and dread and loss and regret?\"\n\nDeath to a three year old (who is aware of dying) will often include pain. There will also be fear, the desire for it\u0027s parents\u0027 comfort, possibly even betrayal, abandonment...the list can go on. Death to a cat or dog will include many of the same things, none of which a fetus is capable of experiencing.\n\nAnd finally, you neglected to address something from my previous post, so I\u0027ll restate it:\n\n\u0026gt;And on a tangentially related note, suppose abortion is outlawed.
